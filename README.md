- **[Spurious Rewards: Rethinking Training Signals in RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10947)**  `arXiv:2506.10947`  
  _Rulin Shao, Shuyue Stella Li, Rui Xin, Scott Geng, Yiping Wang, Sewoong Oh, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the 29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely spurious reward signals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

  Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of planning tasks, LLMs have shown to be particularly good in interpreting human intents among other uses. This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI planning engine, alongside an execution and monitoring framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of GenPlanX in assisting users with office-related tasks, highlighting its potential to streamline workflows and enhance productivity through seamless human-AI collaboration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9 state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative reasoning.

- **[Think before You Simulate: Symbolic Reasoning to Orchestrate Neural Computation for Counterfactual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10753)**  `arXiv:2506.10753`  
  _Adam Ishay, Zhun Yang, Joohyung Lee, Ilgu Kang, Dongjae Lim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem. While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations, especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning, leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

- **[TeleMath: A Benchmark for Large Language Models in Telecom Mathematical Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10674)**  `arXiv:2506.10674`  
  _Vincenzo Colle, Mohamed Sana, Nicola Piovesan, Antonio De Domenico, Fadhel Ayed, Merouane Debbah_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500 question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges. We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result reproducibility and support future research.

  _Henrik Sebastian Steude, Alexander Diedrich, Ingo Pill, Lukas Moddemann, Daniel Vranje≈°, Oliver Niggemann_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that leverages minimal causal relationship information between subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

- **[Scientists' First Exam: Probing Cognitive Abilities of MLLM via Perception, Understanding, and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10521)**  `arXiv:2506.10521`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

  _Yaoming Zhu, Junxin Wang, Yiyang Li, Lin Qiu, ZongYu Wang, Jun Xu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning. This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities, and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully open-source resource (this https URL), we hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities for future LLMs.

- **[Mirage-1: Augmenting and Updating GUI Agent with Hierarchical Multimodal Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10387)**  `arXiv:2506.10387`  
  _Yuquan Xie, Zaijing Li, Rui Shao, Gongwei Chen, Kaiwen Zhou, Yinchuan Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments, we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap, we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm, which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively.

- **[NeuroPAL: Punctuated Anytime Learning with Neuroevolution for Macromanagement in Starcraft: Brood War](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10384)**  `arXiv:2506.10384`  
  _Jim O'Connor, Yeonghun Lee, Gary B Parker_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning (PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

- **[Optimus-3: Towards Generalist Multimodal Minecraft Agents with Scalable Task Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10357)**  `arXiv:2506.10357`  
  _Zaijing Li, Yuquan Xie, Rui Shao, Gongwei Chen, Weili Guan, Dongmei Jiang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.

- **[Closer to Language than Steam: AI as the Cognitive Engine of a New Productivity Revolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10281)**  `arXiv:2506.10281`  
  _Xinmin Fang, Lingfeng Tao, Zhengxiong Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills, organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity, concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities, marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

- **[WGSR-Bench: Wargame-based Game-theoretic Strategic Reasoning Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10264)**  `arXiv:2506.10264`  
  _Qiyue Yin, Pei Xu, Qiaozhe Li, Shengda Liu, Shengqi Shen, Tong Wang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks, particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty, adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic intelligence.

- **[Towards Responsible AI: Advances in Safety, Fairness, and Accountability of Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10192)**  `arXiv:2506.10192`  
  _Filip Cano_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints, this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework, providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches. Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

- **[One Patient, Many Contexts: Scaling Medical AI Through Contextual Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10157)**  `arXiv:2506.10157`  
  _Michelle M. Li, Ben Y. Reis, Adam Rodman, Tianxi Cai, Noa Dagan, Ran D. Balicer, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective, we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties, populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and regions, and expand access to medical care.

- **[A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)**  `arXiv:2506.10130`  
  _Luciano Floridi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

- **[Reinforcing Multimodal Understanding and Generation with Dual Self-rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07963)**  `arXiv:2506.07963`  
  _Jixiang Hong, Yiran Zhang, Guanzhong Wang, Yi Liu, Ji-Rong Wen, Rui Yan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models (LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework. However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision (e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

  _John Laird, Christian Lebiere, Paul Rosenbloom, Andrea Stocco_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Common Model of Cognition (CMC) provides an abstract characterization of the structure and processing required by a cognitive architecture for human-like minds. We propose a unified approach to integrating metacognition within the CMC. We propose that metacognition involves reasoning over explicit representations of an agent's cognitive capabilities and processes in working memory. Our proposal exploits the existing cognitive capabilities of the CMC, making minimal extensions in the structure and information available within working memory. We provide examples of metacognition within our proposal.

  _Suhana Bedi, Iddah Mlauzi, Daniel Shin, Sanmi Koyejo, Nigam H. Shah_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, yet the relationship between component-level optimization and system-wide performance remains poorly understood. We evaluated this relationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across four abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering, interpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems (one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized models for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes, process adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the component-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and excellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent system). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in healthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to information flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the need for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics alone.

  _Lucas Irwin, Arda Kaz, Peiyao Sheng, Sewoong Oh, Pramod Viswanath_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark (CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features, followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features (Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a range of educational tasks, but are still understudied for their potential to solve mathematical problems. In this study, we compare three prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0, on three mathematics datasets of varying complexities (GSM8K, MATH500, and UNSW datasets). We take a five-dimensional approach based on the Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework to assess final answer correctness, step completeness, step validity, intermediate calculation accuracy, and problem comprehension. The results show that GPT-4o is the most stable and consistent in performance across all the datasets, but particularly it performs outstandingly in high-level questions of the UNSW dataset. DeepSeek-V3 is competitively strong in well-structured domains such as optimisation, but suffers from fluctuations in accuracy in statistical inference tasks. Gemini-2.0 shows strong linguistic understanding and clarity in well-structured problems but performs poorly in multi-step reasoning and symbolic logic. Our error analysis reveals particular deficits in each model: GPT-4o is at times lacking in sufficient explanation or precision; DeepSeek-V3 leaves out intermediate steps; and Gemini-2.0 is less flexible in mathematical reasoning in higher dimensions.

  Assistance games are a promising alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training AI assistants. Assistance games resolve key drawbacks of RLHF, such as incentives for deceptive behavior, by explicitly modeling the interaction between assistant and user as a two-player game where the assistant cannot observe their shared goal. Despite their potential, assistance games have only been explored in simple settings. Scaling them to more complex environments is difficult because it requires both solving intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty and accurately modeling human users' behavior. We present the first scalable approach to solving assistance games and apply it to a new, challenging Minecraft-based assistance game with over $10^{400}$ possible goals. Our approach, AssistanceZero, extends AlphaZero with a neural network that predicts human actions and rewards, enabling it to plan under uncertainty. We show that AssistanceZero outperforms model-free RL algorithms and imitation learning in the Minecraft-based assistance game. In a human study, our AssistanceZero-trained assistant significantly reduces the number of actions participants take to complete building tasks in Minecraft. Our results suggest that assistance games are a tractable framework for training effective AI assistants in complex environments. Our code and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial patch attacks pose a major threat to vision systems by embedding localized perturbations that mislead deep models. Traditional defense methods often require retraining or fine-tuning, making them impractical for real-world deployment. We propose a training-free Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for adversarial patch detection. By retrieving visually similar patches and images that resemble stored attacks in a continuously expanding database, VRAG performs generative reasoning to identify diverse attack types, all without additional training or fine-tuning. We extensively evaluate open-source large-scale VLMs, including Qwen-VL-Plus, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, and UI-TARS-72B-DPO, alongside Gemini-2.0, a closed-source model. Notably, the open-source UI-TARS-72B-DPO model achieves up to 95 percent classification accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source adversarial patch detection. Gemini-2.0 attains the highest overall accuracy, 98 percent, but remains closed-source. Experimental results demonstrate VRAG's effectiveness in identifying a variety of adversarial patches with minimal human annotation, paving the way for robust, practical defenses against evolving adversarial patch attacks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is growing concern over the safety of powerful diffusion models (DMs), as they are often misused to produce inappropriate, not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content or generate copyrighted material or data of individuals who wish to be forgotten. Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models are typically trained with next-turn rewards, limiting their ability to optimize for long-term interaction. As a result, they often respond passively to ambiguous or open-ended user requests, failing to help users reach their ultimate intents and leading to inefficient conversations. To address these limitations, we introduce CollabLLM, a novel and general training framework that enhances multiturn human-LLM collaboration. Its key innovation is a collaborative simulation that estimates the long-term contribution of responses using Multiturn-aware Rewards. By reinforcement fine-tuning these rewards, CollabLLM goes beyond responding to user requests, and actively uncovers user intent and offers insightful suggestions-a key step towards more human-centered AI. We also devise a multiturn interaction benchmark with three challenging tasks such as document creation. CollabLLM significantly outperforms our baselines with averages of 18.5% higher task performance and 46.3% improved interactivity by LLM judges. Finally, we conduct a large user study with 201 judges, where CollabLLM increases user satisfaction by 17.6% and reduces user spent time by 10.4%.

  _Matthew Riemer, Zahra Ashktorab, Djallel Bouneffouf, Payel Das, Miao Liu, Justin D. Weisz, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Our paper argues that the majority of theory of mind benchmarks are broken because of their inability to directly test how large language models (LLMs) adapt to new partners. This problem stems from the fact that theory of mind benchmarks for LLMs are overwhelmingly inspired by the methods used to test theory of mind in humans and fall victim to a fallacy of attributing human-like qualities to AI agents. We expect that humans will engage in a consistent reasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known to not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only measure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the behavior of others. However, this type of metric is only informative when agents exhibit self-consistent reasoning. Thus, we introduce the concept of functional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following a rational response to their behavior. We find that many open source LLMs are capable of displaying strong literal theory of mind capabilities, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even with exceedingly simple partner policies. Simply put, strong literal theory of mind performance does not necessarily imply strong functional theory of mind performance or vice versa. Achieving functional theory of mind, particularly over long interaction horizons with a partner, is a significant challenge deserving a prominent role in any meaningful LLM theory of mind evaluation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods mainly rely on trial-and-error exploration, often lacking mechanisms to guide agents toward more informative decision-making and struggling to leverage past experiences, resulting in low sample efficiency. To overcome this issue, we propose an innovative framework inspired by cognitive principles: Cognitive Belief-Driven Reinforcement Learning (CBD-RL). By incorporating cognitive heuristics, CBD-RL transforms conventional trial-and-error learning into a more structured and guided learning paradigm, simulating the human reasoning process. This framework's core is a belief system that optimizes action probabilities by integrating feedback with prior experience, thus enhancing decision making under uncertainty. It also organizes state-action pairs into meaningful categories, promoting generalization and improving sample efficiency. The concrete implementations of this framework, CBDQ, CBDPPO, and CBDSAC, demonstrate superior performance in discrete and continuous action spaces in diverse environments such as Atari and MuJoCo. By bridging cognitive science and reinforcement learning, this research opens a new avenue for developing RL systems that are more interpretable, efficient, and cognitively inspired.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a common approach for Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in AI tasks. Embedding dimensions depend on application scenarios. Requiring a new dimension means training a new KGE model from scratch, increasing cost and limiting efficiency and flexibility. In this work, we propose a novel KGE training framework MED. It allows one training to obtain a croppable KGE model for multiple scenarios with different dimensional needs. Sub-models of required dimensions can be directly cropped and used without extra training. In MED, we propose a mutual learning mechanism to improve the low-dimensional sub-models and make high-dimensional sub-models retain the low-dimensional sub-models' capacity, an evolutionary improvement mechanism to promote the high-dimensional sub-models to master the triple that the low-dimensional sub-models can not, and a dynamic loss weight to adaptively balance the multiple losses. Experiments on 4 KGE models across 4 standard KG completion datasets, 3 real-world scenarios using a large-scale KG, and extending MED to the BERT language model demonstrate its effectiveness, high efficiency, and flexible extensibility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness. Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection, showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better reasoning and safer systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets. \textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically, \textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only $51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

  Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of "epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit, 2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here, we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering, while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features, exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together, these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Notably, we demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model, and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data from Magistral Medium.

  Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise, especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced, multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable, interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical reasoning.

  Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base (150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning, but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information. However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

  Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However, existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2) generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles: certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput, demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy, enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines.

  Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs), while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces. This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks, demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs. The code is available atthis https URL.

  With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM) revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and model-specific strengths.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining, by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages included in pretraining.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy ($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by $69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning quality.

  Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance, imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically, Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world life-threatening language detection problems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that, although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct "breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

  This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1) an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and (4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model (LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples, constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e., ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself. Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance. Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover, RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM reasoning.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings. Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models express biased points of view or produce different results based on the assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores. However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer, this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the description of their persona since the model already knows their socio-demographics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024 dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

  Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate 38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS, with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

  Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data, allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and adaptability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models. However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences, we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing consumption.

  _Andrea Yaoyun Cui, Pengfei Yu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models are essentially probability distributions over token sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions. Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling, inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making, such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of large language models to identify their decision patterns under various circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision making of large language models.

  We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and (4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks, experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets, demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech detection in low-resource settings.

  Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\% \& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024 respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

  Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

  _Yi Wang, Max Kreminski_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales, but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation. Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec) trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety; labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

  Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand, especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using 22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis, we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

  To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However, for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally, we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations, especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks, PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to post-training quality of service instability.

  Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation, limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future research on agent tuning and evaluation.

  Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text, visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

  Reviews are valuable resources for customers making purchase decisions in online shopping. However, it is impractical for customers to go over the vast number of reviews and manually conclude the prominent opinions, which prompts the need for automated opinion summarization systems. Previous approaches, either extractive or abstractive, face challenges in automatically producing grounded aspect-centric summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization system that not only captures predominant opinions from an aspect perspective with supporting evidence, but also adapts to varying domains without relying on a pre-defined set of aspects. Our proposed framework, ASESUM, summarizes viewpoints relevant to the critical aspects of a product by extracting aspect-centric arguments and measuring their salience and validity. We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing diverse perspectives of the original reviews compared to new and existing methods.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\% and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about 30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model compared with the natural language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies, whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling. Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms: Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (Unified RoPE) methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this Unified RoPE, we introduce TransXSSM, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a 4K sequence length, TransXSSM exhibits training and inference speeds that are 42.3\% and 29.5\% faster, respectively, relative to standard Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modelingthis http URLfurthermore scales more effectively: TransXSSM-1.3B gains 7.22\% in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\% gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models, enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful. While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for generating more faithful self-NLE.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators, raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple, lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

  Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of 76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

  Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability: just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy, self-consistent LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values, which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains. Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

  We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors: (1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3) LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors. On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally, while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA atthis http URL.

  Improving cultural competence of language technologies is important. However most recent works rarely engage with the communities they study, and instead rely on synthetic setups and imperfect proxies of culture. In this work, we take a human-centered approach to discover and measure language-based cultural norms, and cultural competence of LLMs. We focus on a single kind of culture, research cultures, and a single task, adapting writing across research cultures. Through a set of interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, who are experts at moving between cultures, we create a framework of structural, stylistic, rhetorical, and citational norms that vary across research cultures. We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and their tendency to homogenise writing. Overall, our work illustrates the efficacy of a human-centered approach to measuring cultural norms in human-written and LLM-generated texts.

  Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models (LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we leverage the Q-learning on LLMs, and propose a framework called straQ*. Our framework allows a plug-and-play LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC, determine the optimal strategy based on long-term returns, and finally guide the LLM to response. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that straQ* outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine, chain of thought, finetuning, and finite state machines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from pre-training scaling to post-training and test-time scaling. Across these developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement learning (RLHF, RLAIF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities for diverse tasks. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of learning from rewards, from the perspective of reward models and learning strategies across training, inference, and post-inference stages. We further discuss the benchmarks for reward models and the primary applications. Finally we highlight the challenges and future directions. We maintain a paper collection atthis https URL.

  In this paper we present a sample treebank for Old English based on the UD Cairo sentences, collected and annotated as part of a classroom curriculum in Historical Linguistics. To collect the data, a sample of 20 sentences illustrating a range of syntactic constructions in the world's languages, we employ a combination of LLM prompting and searches in authentic Old English data. For annotation we assigned sentences to multiple students with limited prior exposure to UD, whose annotations we compare and adjudicate. Our results suggest that while current LLM outputs in Old English do not reflect authentic syntax, this can be mitigated by post-editing, and that although beginner annotators do not possess enough background to complete the task perfectly, taken together they can produce good results and learn from the experience. We also conduct preliminary parsing experiments using Modern English training data, and find that although performance on Old English is poor, parsing on annotated features (lemma, hyperlemma, gloss) leads to improved performance.

  _Z√©bulon Goriely, Paula Buttery_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models provide a key framework for studying linguistic theories based on prediction, but phonological analysis using large language models (LLMs) is difficult; there are few phonological benchmarks beyond English and the standard input representation used in LLMs (subwords of graphemes) is not suitable for analyzing the representation of phonemes. In this work, we demonstrate how word segmentation can be used as a phonological probing task, allowing us to study the representations learned by phoneme-based language models trained on child-directed speech across 31 languages. Following computational models of word segmentation, we present unsupervised methods for extracting word boundaries from a trained model using the observation that prediction-error peaks at the start of words. We also use linear probes to identify that these models implicitly track word boundaries, even when they do not appear in training. This cross-lingual work corroborates statistical learning theories of acquisition and empirically motivates new methods for training subword tokenizers.

  _Z√©bulon Goriely, Paula Buttery_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce two resources: (i) G2P+, a tool for converting orthographic datasets to a consistent phonemic representation; and (ii) IPA CHILDES, a phonemic dataset of child-centered speech across 31 languages. Prior tools for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion result in phonemic vocabularies that are inconsistent with established phonemic inventories, an issue which G2P+ addresses by leveraging the inventories in the Phoible database. Using this tool, we augment CHILDES with phonemic transcriptions to produce IPA CHILDES. This new resource fills several gaps in existing phonemic datasets, which often lack multilingual coverage, spontaneous speech, and a focus on child-directed language. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset for phonological research by training phoneme language models on 11 languages and probing them for distinctive features, finding that the distributional properties of phonemes are sufficient to learn major class and place features cross-lingually.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate creative and engaging narratives from user-specified input, but maintaining coherence and emotional depth throughout these AI-generated stories remains a challenge. In this work, we propose SCORE, a framework for Story Coherence and Retrieval Enhancement, designed to detect and resolve narrative inconsistencies. By tracking key item statuses and generating episode summaries, SCORE uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, incorporating TF-IDF and cosine similarity to identify related episodes and enhance the overall story structure. Results from testing multiple LLM-generated stories demonstrate that SCORE significantly improves the consistency and stability of narrative coherence compared to baseline GPT models, providing a more robust method for evaluating and refining AI-generated narratives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized external tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or noisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to outpatient referral tasks across healthcare systems. However, there is a lack of standardized evaluation criteria to assess their effectiveness, particularly in dynamic, interactive scenarios. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems. This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues. Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues.

  Measuring social bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, but existing bias evaluation methods struggle to assess bias in long-form generation. We propose a Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG), an adaptation of the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), designed to evaluate social bias in long-form generation by having LLMs generate continuations of story prompts. Building our benchmark in English and Korean, we measure the probability of neutral and biased generations across ten LLMs. We also compare our long-form story generation evaluation results with multiple-choice BBQ evaluation, showing that the two approaches produce inconsistent results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In our era of widespread false information, human fact-checkers often face the challenge of duplicating efforts when verifying claims that may have already been addressed in other countries or languages. As false information transcends linguistic boundaries, the ability to automatically detect previously fact-checked claims across languages has become an increasingly important task. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection. We assess seven LLMs across 20 languages in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that while LLMs perform well for high-resource languages, they struggle with low-resource languages. Moreover, translating original texts into English proved to be beneficial for low-resource languages. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection and provide a foundation for further research on this promising application of LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How to align large language models (LLMs) with user preferences from a static general dataset has been frequently studied. However, user preferences are usually personalized, changing, and diverse regarding culture, values, or time. This leads to the problem that the actual user preferences often do not coincide with those trained by the model developers in the practical use of LLMs. Since we cannot collect enough data and retrain for every demand, researching efficient real-time preference adaptation methods based on the backbone LLMs during test time is important. To this end, we introduce Amulet, a novel, training-free framework that formulates the decoding process of every token as a separate online learning problem with the guidance of simple user-provided prompts, thus enabling real-time optimization to satisfy users' personalized preferences. To reduce the computational cost brought by this optimization process for each token, we additionally provide a closed-form solution for each iteration step of the optimization process, thereby reducing the computational time cost to a negligible level. The detailed experimental results demonstrate that Amulet can achieve significant performance improvements in rich settings with combinations of different LLMs, datasets, and user preferences, while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) make it easy to rewrite a text in any style -- e.g. to make it more polite, persuasive, or more positive -- but evaluation thereof is not straightforward. A challenge lies in measuring content preservation: that content not attributable to style change is retained. This paper presents a large meta-evaluation of metrics for evaluating style and attribute transfer, focusing on content preservation. We find that meta-evaluation studies on existing datasets lead to misleading conclusions about the suitability of metrics for content preservation. Widely used metrics show a high correlation with human judgments despite being deemed unsuitable for the task -- because they do not abstract from style changes when evaluating content preservation. We show that the overly high correlations with human judgment stem from the nature of the test data. To address this issue, we introduce a new, challenging test set specifically designed for evaluating content preservation metrics for style transfer. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that suitable metrics for content preservation for style transfer indeed are style-aware. To support efficient evaluation, we propose a new style-aware method that utilises small language models, obtaining a higher alignment with human judgements than prompting a model of a similar size as an autorater.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When prompted to think step-by-step, language models (LMs) produce a chain of thought (CoT), a sequence of reasoning steps that the model supposedly used to produce its prediction. Despite much work on CoT prompting, it is unclear if reasoning verbalized in a CoT is faithful to the models' parametric beliefs. We introduce a framework for measuring parametric faithfulness of generated reasoning, and propose Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning steps (FUR), an instance of this framework. FUR erases information contained in reasoning steps from model parameters, and measures faithfulness as the resulting effect on the model's prediction. Our experiments with four LMs and five multi-hop multi-choice question answering (MCQA) datasets show that FUR is frequently able to precisely change the underlying models' prediction for a given instance by unlearning key steps, indicating when a CoT is parametrically faithful. Further analysis shows that CoTs generated by models post-unlearning support different answers, hinting at a deeper effect of unlearning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to the demand for efficient fine-tuning of large language models, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as one of the most effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Nevertheless, while LoRA improves efficiency, there remains room for improvement in accuracy. Herein, we adopt a novel perspective to assess the characteristics of LoRA ranks. The results reveal that different ranks within the LoRA modules not only exhibit varying levels of importance but also evolve dynamically throughout the fine-tuning process, which may limit the performance of LoRA. Based on these findings, we propose BeamLoRA, which conceptualizes each LoRA module as a beam where each rank naturally corresponds to a potential sub-solution, and the fine-tuning process becomes a search for the optimal sub-solution combination. BeamLoRA dynamically eliminates underperforming sub-solutions while expanding the parameter space for promising ones, enhancing performance with a fixed rank. Extensive experiments across three base models and 12 datasets spanning math reasoning, code generation, and commonsense reasoning demonstrate that BeamLoRA consistently enhances the performance of LoRA, surpassing the other baseline methods.

  Understanding pragmatics-the use of language in context-is crucial for developing NLP systems capable of interpreting nuanced language use. Despite recent advances in language technologies, including large language models, evaluating their ability to handle pragmatic phenomena such as implicatures and references remains challenging. To advance pragmatic abilities in models, it is essential to understand current evaluation trends and identify existing limitations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of resources designed for evaluating pragmatic capabilities in NLP, categorizing datasets by the pragmatic phenomena they address. We analyze task designs, data collection methods, evaluation approaches, and their relevance to real-world applications. By examining these resources in the context of modern language models, we highlight emerging trends, challenges, and gaps in existing benchmarks. Our survey aims to clarify the landscape of pragmatic evaluation and guide the development of more comprehensive and targeted benchmarks, ultimately contributing to more nuanced and context-aware NLP models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Depth pruning aims to reduce the inference cost of a large language model without any hardware-specific complications, by simply removing several less important transformer blocks. However, our empirical findings suggest that the importance of a transformer block may be highly task-dependent -- a block that is crucial for a task can be removed without degrading the accuracy on another task. Based on this observation, we develop a dynamic depth pruning algorithm, coined PuDDing (Prompt-routed Dynamic Depth Pruning), which determines which blocks to omit from the model based on the input prompt. PuDDing operates by training a lightweight router to predict the best omission set among a set of options, where this option set has also been constructed in a data-driven manner. Empirical results on commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PuDDing effectively accelerates the inference language models, and achieves better on-task performance than static depth pruning baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input context in order to perform complex tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations in order to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. We propose Squeezed Attention to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input context is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant, and then compute exact attention using only the important keys, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also present a hierarchical version of our algorithm which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the fixed context length. We evaluate our method on long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3.1$\times$ reduction in KV budget with no noticeable accuracy loss and up to an 8$\times$ reduction with only a 0.5 point accuracy gap for the LLaMA-2-7B-32K, LWM-Text-Chat-1M, and Longchat-7B-v1.5-32K models. Futhermore, we implement kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4$\times$ speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference.

  Many-shot in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a unique setup to both utilize and test the ability of large language models to handle long context. This paper delves into long-context language model (LCLM) evaluation through many-shot ICL. We first ask: what types of ICL tasks benefit from additional demonstrations, and how effective are they in evaluating LCLMs? We find that classification and summarization tasks show performance improvements with additional demonstrations, while translation and reasoning tasks do not exhibit clear trends. Next, we investigate the extent to which different tasks necessitate retrieval versus global context understanding. We develop metrics to categorize ICL tasks into two groups: (i) similar-sample learning (SSL): tasks where retrieval of the most similar examples is sufficient for good performance, and (ii) all-sample learning (ASL): tasks that necessitate a deeper comprehension of all examples in the prompt. Lastly, we introduce a new many-shot ICL benchmark, MANYICLBENCH, to characterize model's ability on both fronts and benchmark 12 LCLMs using MANYICLBENCH. We find that while state-of-the-art models demonstrate good performance up to 64k tokens in SSL tasks, many models experience significant performance drops at only 16k tokens in ASL tasks.

  Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to detect synthetic text, mitigating misuse cases like fake news and academic dishonesty. While existing watermarking detection techniques primarily focus on classifying entire documents as watermarked or not, they often neglect the common scenario of identifying individual watermark segments within longer, mixed-source documents. Drawing inspiration from plagiarism detection systems, we propose two novel methods for partial watermark detection. First, we develop a geometry cover detection framework aimed at determining whether there is a watermark segment in long text. Second, we introduce an adaptive online learning algorithm to pinpoint the precise location of watermark segments within the text. Evaluated on three popular watermarking techniques (KGW-Watermark, Unigram-Watermark, and Gumbel-Watermark), our approach achieves high accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, our framework is adaptable to other watermarking techniques, offering new insights for precise watermark detection. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the success of Transformers, handling long contexts remains challenging due to the limited length generalization and quadratic complexity of self-attention. Thus Transformers often require post-training with a larger attention window, significantly increasing computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on dynamic context, Grouped Cross Attention (GCA), which can generalize to 1000 times the pre-training context length while maintaining the ability to access distant information with a constant attention window size. For a given input sequence, we split it into chunks and use each chunk to retrieve top-k relevant past chunks for subsequent text generation. Specifically, unlike most previous works that use an off-the-shelf retriever, our key innovation allows the retriever to learn how to retrieve past chunks that better minimize the auto-regressive loss of subsequent tokens in an end-to-end manner. Such a mechanism accommodates retrieved chunks with a fixed-size attention window to achieve long-range information access, significantly reducing computational and memory costs during training and inference. Experiments show that GCA-based models achieve near-perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval for 16M context lengths, which is 1000 times the training length.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-model workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) $\textit{response evaluation}$, and (2) $\textit{response generation}$. In the $\textit{response evaluation}$ module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the $\textit{response generation}$ module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-model configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-model Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse models. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13\% on GSM8K and 70\% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While past works have shown how uncertainty quantification can be applied to large language model (LLM) outputs, the question of whether resulting uncertainty guarantees still hold within sub-groupings of data remains open. In our work, given some long-form text generated by an LLM, we study uncertainty at both the level of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and across the entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Using biography generation as a testbed for this study, we derive a set of (demographic) attributes (e.g., whether some text describes a man or woman) for each generation to form such "subgroups" of data. We find that although canonical methods for both types of uncertainty quantification perform well when measuring across the entire dataset, such guarantees break down when examining particular subgroups. Having established this issue, we invoke group-conditional methods for uncertainty quantification -- multicalibration and multivalid conformal prediction -- and find that across a variety of approaches, additional subgroup information consistently improves calibration and conformal prediction within subgroups (while crucially retaining guarantees across the entire dataset). As the problems of calibration, conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively explored in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these results to form a benchmark for this setting.

  The National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) stands as a foundational piece of environmental legislation in the United States, requiring federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their proposed actions. The primary mechanism for achieving this is through the preparation of Environmental Assessments (EAs) and, for significant impacts, comprehensive Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). Large Language Model (LLM)s' effectiveness in specialized domains like NEPA remains untested for adoption in federal decision-making processes. To address this gap, we present NEPA Question and Answering Dataset (NEPAQuAD), the first comprehensive benchmark derived from EIS documents, along with a modular and transparent evaluation pipeline, MAPLE, to assess LLM performance on NEPA-focused regulatory reasoning tasks. Our benchmark leverages actual EIS documents to create diverse question types, ranging from factual to complex problem-solving ones. We built a modular and transparent evaluation pipeline to test both closed- and open-source models in zero-shot or context-driven QA benchmarks. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs using our framework to assess both their prior knowledge and their ability to process NEPA-specific information. The experimental results reveal that all the models consistently achieve their highest performance when provided with the gold passage as context. While comparing the other context-driven approaches for each model, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based approaches substantially outperform PDF document contexts, indicating that neither model is well suited for long-context question-answering tasks. Our analysis suggests that NEPA-focused regulatory reasoning tasks pose a significant challenge for LLMs, particularly in terms of understanding the complex semantics and effectively processing the lengthy regulatory documents.

  Hate speech poses a significant threat to social harmony. Over the past two years, Indonesia has seen a ten-fold increase in the online hate speech ratio, underscoring the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. However, progress is hindered by the limited availability of labeled data for Indonesian texts. The condition is even worse for marginalized minorities, such as Shia, LGBTQ, and other ethnic minorities because hate speech is underreported and less understood by detection tools. Furthermore, the lack of accommodation for subjectivity in current datasets compounds this issue. To address this, we introduce IndoToxic2024, a comprehensive Indonesian hate speech and toxicity classification dataset. Comprising 43,692 entries annotated by 19 diverse individuals, the dataset focuses on texts targeting vulnerable groups in Indonesia, specifically during the hottest political event in the country: the presidential election. We establish baselines for seven binary classification tasks, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.78 with a BERT model (IndoBERTweet) fine-tuned for hate speech classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how incorporating demographic information can enhance the zero-shot performance of the large language model, gpt-3.5-turbo. However, we also caution that an overemphasis on demographic information can negatively impact the fine-tuned model performance due to data fragmentation.

  Despite significant advancements, large multimodal models (LMMs) still struggle to bridge the gap between low-level visual perception -- focusing on shapes, sizes, and layouts -- and high-level language reasoning, such as semantics and logic. This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise visual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual reasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics -- images composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web, design, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we enable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level reasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes. However, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To tackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which introduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual representation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their corresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data and represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics. This abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by foundation models for zero-shot generalization. Without human-annotated data, empirical results show that VDLM significantly improves state-of-the-art LMMs like GPT-4o on various multimodal perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses of VDLM show improved interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning. We also demonstrate a positive correlation between PVD quality and task performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks - resulting in harmful, unethical, or biased text generations. However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge graphs often suffer from incompleteness issues, which can be alleviated through information completion. However, current state-of-the-art deep knowledge convolutional embedding models rely on external convolution kernels and conventional convolution processes, which limits the feature interaction capability of the model. This paper introduces a novel dynamic convolutional embedding model, ConvD, which directly reshapes relation embeddings into multiple internal convolution kernels. This approach effectively enhances the feature interactions between relation embeddings and entity embeddings. Simultaneously, we incorporate a priori knowledge-optimized attention mechanism that assigns different contribution weight coefficients to the multiple relation convolution kernels in dynamic convolution, further boosting the expressive power of the model. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our proposed model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, with average improvements ranging from 3.28% to 14.69% across all model evaluation metrics, while the number of parameters is reduced by 50.66% to 85.40% compared to other state-of-the-art models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis (NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However, existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint, a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as object insertion and multi-region inpainting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics. Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids, cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture. Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g., text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated video detection. Project Page:this https URL

  _Qizhe Zhang, Mengzhen Liu, Lichen Li, Ming Lu, Yuan Zhang, Junwen Pan, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task, alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models. Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers 4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines, 6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams, and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated knowledge image-prompt pairs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel, contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework, which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective. Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45% compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at 768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism. Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs. Code and models will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets. Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR) which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image quality based on our new insight on offsetthis http URL, quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance.

  Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts, yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper, we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing, multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of AI-assisted graphic design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the 4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

  _Hui Yang, Wei Sun, Jian Liu, Jin Zheng, Jian Xiao, Ajmal Mian_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception, we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF, leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

  The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot, text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models (LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt, and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark, despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal, text-queryable video summarization.

  This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and obstacle avoidance. A demo video is available at the project website.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods, which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting. Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore, we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world models.

  Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier, which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks (e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art techniques.

  Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images: it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony. To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments, PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality of SOTA commercial systems.

  Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks. However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model, the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality, enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network (HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest computational overhead. Code will be released.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities, we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved hierarchical generalization.

  _Christopher Gaul, Eduardo Fidalgo, Enrique Alegre, Roc√≠o Alaiz Rodr√≠guez, Eri P√©rez Corral_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization. Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from the loss.Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images, stressing extreme pose ($>$45¬∞), expression, and low image quality to emulate real-world shifts.Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline, demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12 and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content, undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism. To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources, developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging, where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels. Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across scales.Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations. Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes. Github page:this https URL

  Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision. Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources, GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17 evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data, GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and data will be publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps. Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly available.

  Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary, text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly available.

  _Suin Lee, Dae-Shik Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However, these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

  Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets are available atthis https URL.

  _Eshan Ramesh, Nishio Takayuki_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

  Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing, yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP (Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically, SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%. Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First, edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks, random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

  Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the underlying hyperspherical manifold.

  Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI. Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR, T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

  Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report generation.

  In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However, most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details, such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been crucial across various domains, including autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and mixed reality. Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and memory requirements. ESLAM introduced a plane-based tensor decomposition but still struggled with memory growth. Addressing these challenges, we propose a more efficient visual SLAM model, called LRSLAM, utilizing low-rank tensor decomposition methods. Our approach, leveraging the Six-axis and CP decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency, and reconstruction/localization quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches. Evaluation across diverse indoor RGB-D datasets demonstrates LRSLAM's superior performance in terms of parameter efficiency, processing time, and accuracy, retaining reconstruction and localization quality. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.

- **[Balancing Tails when Comparing Distributions: Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI) with Application to Bias Evaluation in Operational Face Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10564)**  `arXiv:2506.10564`  
  _Imanol Solano, Julian Fierrez, Aythami Morales, Alejandro Pe√±a, Ruben Tolosana, Francisco Zamora-Martinez, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets) confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This report presents ContextRefine-CLIP (CR-CLIP), an efficient model for visual-textual multi-instance retrieval tasks. The approach is based on the dual-encoder AVION, on which we introduce a cross-modal attention flow module to achieve bidirectional dynamic interaction and refinement between visual and textual features to generate more context-aware joint representations. For soft-label relevance matrices provided in tasks such as EPIC-KITCHENS-100, CR-CLIP can work with Symmetric Multi-Similarity Loss to achieve more accurate semantic alignment and optimization using the refined features. Without using ensemble learning, the CR-CLIP model achieves 66.78mAP and 82.08nDCG on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 public leaderboard, which significantly outperforms the baseline model and fully validates its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval.

  We present SLICK, a novel framework for precise and robust car damage segmentation that leverages structural priors and domain knowledge to tackle real-world automotive inspection challenges. SLICK introduces five key components: (1) Selective Part Segmentation using a high-resolution semantic backbone guided by structural priors to achieve surgical accuracy in segmenting vehicle parts even under occlusion, deformation, or paint loss; (2) Localization-Aware Attention blocks that dynamically focus on damaged regions, enhancing fine-grained damage detection in cluttered and complex street scenes; (3) an Instance-Sensitive Refinement head that leverages panoptic cues and shape priors to disentangle overlapping or adjacent parts, enabling precise boundary alignment; (4) Cross-Channel Calibration through multi-scale channel attention that amplifies subtle damage signals such as scratches and dents while suppressing noise like reflections and decals; and (5) a Knowledge Fusion Module that integrates synthetic crash data, part geometry, and real-world insurance datasets to improve generalization and handle rare cases effectively. Experiments on large-scale automotive datasets demonstrate SLICK's superior segmentation performance, robustness, and practical applicability for insurance and automotive inspection workflows.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning (CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance. We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture, specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images. Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain, we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated aircraft inspection technologies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest. Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation. Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation, avoiding interference from complexthis http URLfurther contribute a high-quality, multi-category manually annotated dataset.

  _Guyang Zhang, Waleed Abdulla_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits, thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers' interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation. Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB) algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

  The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently, vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains, sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap, reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection frameworks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions. While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses. Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical images.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction, cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm. Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and 0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other state-of-the-art methods.

  _Guoyi Zhang, Guangsheng Xu, Siyang Chen, Han Wang, Xiaohu Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework, termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically, we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global, multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details, especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this, we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas. Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters, DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced computational overhead. Code is available atthis https URL.

  The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video. Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions, recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes. This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

  The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

  The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion. Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability, consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1, a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will be publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view. However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as 3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

  Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors. Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05). High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for future design.

  Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way, we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage, given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models (LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation, we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism, allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000 images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions, highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content that causes student confusion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50 (ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM, deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen), uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions. This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world clinical applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands. Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient, probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA), instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence, enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world applications.

  _Rajeev Yasarla, Shizhong Han, Hong Cai, Fatih Porikli_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper, we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split, DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5% of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting. The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability. Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation, and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

  _Parsa Rahimi, Sebastien Marcel_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g. "my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries - DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal retrievals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning (SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization and poor computational efficiency.In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters, and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable Prompt-Aware R√©ny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant computational costs. We release our code on the project page:this https URL

  End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm, offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model, without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math, showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3) alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT, yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks, leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and structured vision backbones.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits. First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video (I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture. To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare, criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs. Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841 macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS, establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset will be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and consistent visual stories.

  Historical satellite imagery, such as mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole data, offers rare insights into understanding early urban development and long-term transformation. However, severe quality degradation (e.g., distortion, misalignment, and spectral scarcity) and annotation absence have long hindered semantic segmentation on such historical RS imagery. To bridge this gap and enhance understanding of urban development, we introduce $\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$, an annotated segmentation dataset based on historical satellite imagery with the earliest observation time among all existing segmentation datasets, along with a benchmark framework for unsupervised segmentation tasks, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$. First, $\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$ serves as a novel, expertly annotated semantic segmentation dataset built on mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole imagery, covering 1,240 km$^2$ and key urban classes (buildings, roads, farmland, water). As the earliest segmentation dataset of its kind, it provides a pioneering benchmark for historical urban understanding. Second, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$(Unsupervised Segmentation Model) is a novel unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for historical RS imagery. It employs a confidence-aware alignment mechanism and focal-confidence loss based on a self-supervised learning architecture, which generates robust pseudo-labels and adaptively prioritizes prediction difficulty and label reliability to improve unsupervised segmentation on noisy historical data without manual supervision. Experiments show Urban1960SatUSM significantly outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods on Urban1960SatSeg for segmenting historical urban scenes, promising in paving the way for quantitative studies of long-term urban change using modern computer vision.

  Occupancy prediction infers fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics from camera images of the surrounding environment, making it a critical perception task for autonomous driving. Existing methods either adopt dense grids as scene representation, which is difficult to scale to high resolution, or learn the entire scene using a single set of sparse queries, which is insufficient to handle the various object characteristics. In this paper, we present ODG, a hierarchical dual sparse Gaussian representation to effectively capture complex scene dynamics. Building upon the observation that driving scenes can be universally decomposed into static and dynamic counterparts, we define dual Gaussian queries to better model the diverse scene objects. We utilize a hierarchical Gaussian transformer to predict the occupied voxel centers and semantic classes along with the Gaussian parameters. Leveraging the real-time rendering capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting, we also impose rendering supervision with available depth and semantic map annotations injecting pixel-level alignment to boost occupancy learning. Extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks demonstrate our proposed method sets new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low inference cost.

  Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.Project page:this https URL

  Video content comprehension is essential for various applications, ranging from video analysis to interactive systems. Despite advancements in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), these models often struggle to capture the nuanced, spatiotemporal details essential for thorough video analysis. To address this gap, we introduce Video-CoT, a groundbreaking dataset designed to enhance spatiotemporal understanding using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodologies. Video-CoT contains 192,000 fine-grained spa-tiotemporal question-answer pairs and 23,000 high-quality CoT-annotated samples, providing a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video analysis capabilities. By making these resources publicly available, we aim to encourage further exploration in this critical area. Project website:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood. Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior parameter and computational efficiency.

  Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake, significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning abilities in MLLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g., over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art image generation models.

  Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models.

  Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range. However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR), addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

  The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects, such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks. Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video, demonstrating its effectiveness.

  With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris, enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562 frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset. Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station, achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

  Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding. However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2) introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a 10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4\% of the original performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-fidelity 3D object synthesis remains significantly more challenging than 2D image generation due to the unstructured nature of mesh data and the cubic complexity of dense volumetric grids. Existing two-stage pipelines-compressing meshes with a VAE (using either 2D or 3D supervision), followed by latent diffusion sampling-often suffer from severe detail loss caused by inefficient representations and modality mismatches introduced in VAE. We introduce Sparc3D, a unified framework that combines a sparse deformable marching cubes representation Sparcubes with a novel encoder Sparconv-VAE. Sparcubes converts raw meshes into high-resolution ($1024^3$) surfaces with arbitrary topology by scattering signed distance and deformation fields onto a sparse cube, allowing differentiable optimization. Sparconv-VAE is the first modality-consistent variational autoencoder built entirely upon sparse convolutional networks, enabling efficient and near-lossless 3D reconstruction suitable for high-resolution generative modeling through latent diffusion. Sparc3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on challenging inputs, including open surfaces, disconnected components, and intricate geometry. It preserves fine-grained shape details, reduces training and inference cost, and integrates naturally with latent diffusion models for scalable, high-resolution 3D generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (VI-CoT) enables MLLMs to continually update their understanding and decisions based on step-wise intermediate visual states (IVS), much like a human would, which demonstrates impressive success in various tasks, thereby leading to emerged advancements in related benchmarks. Despite promising progress, current benchmarks provide models with relatively fixed IVS, rather than free-style IVS, whch might forcibly distort the original thinking trajectories, failing to evaluate their intrinsic reasoning capabilities. More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning performance. To tackle above gaps, we introduce a specialized benchmark termed ViC-Bench, consisting of four representive tasks: maze navigation, jigsaw puzzle, embodied long-horizon planning, and complex counting, where each task has dedicated free-style IVS generation pipeline supporting function calls. To systematically examine VI-CoT capability, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating a progressive three-stage strategy with targeted new metrics. Besides, we establish Incremental Prompting Information Injection (IPII) strategy to ablatively explore the prompting factors for VI-CoT. We extensively conduct evaluations for 18 advanced MLLMs, revealing key insights into their VI-CoT capability. Our proposed benchmark is publicly open at Huggingface.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual defect detection in industrial glass manufacturing remains a critical challenge due to the low frequency of defective products, leading to imbalanced datasets that limit the performance of deep learning models and computer vision systems. This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from seventy-eight percent to ninety-three percent when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pansharpening is a crucial remote sensing technique that fuses low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images with high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) imagery. Although deep learning techniques have significantly advanced pansharpening, many existing methods suffer from limited cross-sensor generalization and high computational overhead, restricting their real-time applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient framework that quickly adapts to a specific input instance, completing both training and inference in a short time. Our framework splits the input image into multiple patches, selects a subset for unsupervised CAT training, and then performs inference on all patches, stitching them into the final output. The CAT module, integrated between the feature extraction and channel transformation stages of a pre-trained network, tailors the fused features and fixes the parameters for efficient inference, generating improved results. Our approach offers two key advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: by mitigating cross-sensor degradation, our model--although pre-trained on a specific dataset--achieves superior performance on datasets captured by other sensors; (2) $\textit{Enhanced Computational Efficiency}$: the CAT-enhanced network can swiftly adapt to the test sample using the single LRMS-PAN pair input, without requiring extensive large-scale data retraining. Experiments on the real-world data from WorldView-3 and WorldView-2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-sensor real-world data, while achieving both training and inference of $512\times512$ image within $\textit{0.4 seconds}$ and $4000\times4000$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU.

  Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by proposing novel approaches such as modeling the temporal order of actions, and has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks. We will make our source code and data publicly available soon.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is increasingly adopted in various academic and commercial applications due to its real-time and high-quality rendering capabilities, emphasizing the growing need for copyright protection technologies for 3DGS. However, the large model size of 3DGS requires developing efficient compression techniques. This highlights the necessity of an integrated framework that addresses copyright protection and data compression for 3D content. Nevertheless, existing 3DGS watermarking methods significantly degrade watermark performance under 3DGS compression methods, particularly quantization-based approaches that achieve superior compression performance. To ensure reliable watermark detection under compression, we propose a compression-tolerant anchor-based 3DGS watermarking, which preserves watermark integrity and rendering quality. This is achieved by introducing anchor-based 3DGS watermarking. We embed the watermark into the anchor attributes, particularly the anchor feature, to enhance security and rendering quality. We also propose a quantization distortion layer that injects quantization noise during training, preserving the watermark after quantization-based compression. Moreover, we employ a frequency-aware anchor growing strategy that improves rendering quality and watermark performance by effectively identifying Gaussians in high-frequency regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method preserves the watermark even under compression and maintains high rendering quality.

  Human activity is moderated by norms; however, supervision for normative reasoning is sparse, particularly where norms are physically- or socially-grounded. We thus present EGONORMIA $\|\epsilon\|$, comprising 1,853 (200 for EGONORMIA-verified) multiple choice questions (MCQs) grounded within egocentric videos of human interactions, enabling the evaluation and improvement of normative reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). EGONORMIA spans seven norm categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline to generate grounded MCQs from raw egocentric video. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack robust grounded norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 54% on EGONORMIA and 65% on EGONORMIA-verified, with performance across norm categories indicating significant risks of safety and privacy when VLMs are used in real-world agents. We additionally explore methods for improving normative understanding, demonstrating that a naive retrieval-based generation (RAG) method using EGONORMIA can enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.

  Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).

  Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.

  Current fake image detectors trained on large synthetic image datasets perform satisfactorily on limited studied generative models. However, these detectors suffer a notable performance decline over unseen models. Besides, collecting adequate training data from online generative models is often expensive or infeasible. To overcome these issues, we propose Few-Shot Detector (FSD), a novel AI-generated image detector which learns a specialized metric space for effectively distinguishing unseen fake images using very few samples. Experiments show that FSD achieves state-of-the-art performance by $+11.6\%$ average accuracy on the GenImage dataset with only $10$ additional samples. More importantly, our method is better capable of capturing the intra-category commonality in unseen images without further training. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Latent variable generative models have emerged as powerful tools for generative tasks including image and video synthesis. These models are enabled by pretrained autoencoders that map high resolution data into a compressed lower dimensional latent space, where the generative models can subsequently be developed while requiring fewer computational resources. Despite their effectiveness, the direct application of latent variable models to higher dimensional domains such as videos continues to pose challenges for efficient training and inference. In this paper, we propose an autoencoder that projects volumetric data onto a four-plane factorized latent space that grows sublinearly with the input size, making it ideal for higher dimensional data like videos. The design of our factorized model supports straightforward adoption in a number of conditional generation tasks with latent diffusion models (LDMs), such as class-conditional generation, frame prediction, and video interpolation. Our results show that the proposed four-plane latent space retains a rich representation needed for high-fidelity reconstructions despite the heavy compression, while simultaneously enabling LDMs to operate with significant improvements in speed and memory.

  _Ali Kashefi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently gained attention as an alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in deep learning frameworks. KANs have been integrated into various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, with their performance evaluated. However, their effectiveness within point-cloud-based neural networks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we incorporate KANs into PointNet for the first time to evaluate their performance on 3D point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce PointNet-KAN, built upon two key components. First, it employs KANs instead of traditional MLPs. Second, it retains the core principle of PointNet by using shared KAN layers and applying symmetric functions for global feature extraction, ensuring permutation invariance with respect to the input features. In traditional MLPs, the goal is to train the weights and biases with fixed activation functions; however, in KANs, the goal is to train the activation functions themselves. We use Jacobi polynomials to construct the KAN layers. We extensively and systematically evaluate PointNet-KAN across various polynomial degrees and special types such as the Lagrange, Chebyshev, and Gegenbauer polynomials. Our results show that PointNet-KAN achieves competitive performance compared to PointNet with MLPs on benchmark datasets for 3D object classification and part and semantic segmentation, despite employing a shallower and simpler network architecture. We also study a hybrid PointNet model incorporating both KAN and MLP layers. We hope this work serves as a foundation and provides guidance for integrating KANs, as an alternative to MLPs, into more advanced point cloud processing architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), have garnered significant attention thanks to their powerful representative capabilities. This inspires researchers in transferring the knowledge from these large pre-trained models to other task-specific models, e.g., Video Action Recognition (VAR) models, via particularly leveraging side networks to enhance the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, current transferring approaches in VAR tend to directly transfer the frozen knowledge from large pre-trained models to action recognition networks with minimal cost, instead of exploiting the temporal modeling capabilities of the action recognition models themselves. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel memory-efficient Temporal Difference Side Network (TDS-CLIP) to balance knowledge transferring and temporal modeling, avoiding backpropagation in frozen parameter models. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Difference Adapter (TD-Adapter), which can effectively capture local temporal differences in motion features to strengthen the model's global temporal modeling capabilities. Furthermore, we designed a Side Motion Enhancement Adapter (SME-Adapter) to guide the proposed side network in efficiently learning the rich motion information in videos, thereby improving the side network's ability to capture and learn motion information. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, including Something-Something V1&V2, and Kinetics-400. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance in video action recognition tasks.

  The ever-increasing use of artificial intelligence in autonomous systems has significantly contributed to advance the research on multi-object tracking, adopted in several real-time applications (e.g., autonomous driving, surveillance drones, robotics) to localize and follow the trajectory of multiple objects moving in front of a camera. Current tracking algorithms can be divided into two main categories: some approaches introduce complex heuristics and re-identification models to improve the tracking accuracy and reduce the number of identification switches, without particular attention to the timing performance, whereas other approaches are aimed at reducing response times by removing the re-identification phase, thus penalizing the tracking accuracy. This work proposes a new approach to multi-class object tracking that allows achieving smaller and more predictable execution times, without penalizing the tracking performance. The idea is to reduce the problem of matching predictions with detections into smaller sub-problems by splitting the Hungarian matrix by class and invoking the second re-identification stage only when strictly necessary for a smaller number of elements. The proposed solution was evaluated in complex urban scenarios with several objects of different types (as cars, trucks, bikes, and pedestrians), showing the effectiveness of the multi-class approach with respect to state of the art trackers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Geometric shape classification of vector polygons remains a challenging task in spatial analysis. Previous studies have primarily focused on deep learning approaches for rasterized vector polygons, while the study of discrete polygon representations and corresponding learning methods remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate a graph-based representation of vector polygons and propose a simple graph message-passing framework, PolyMP, along with its densely self-connected variant, PolyMP-DSC, to learn more expressive and robust latent representations of polygons. This framework hierarchically captures self-looped graph information and learns geometric-invariant features for polygon shape classification. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that combining a permutation-invariant graph message-passing neural network with a densely self-connected mechanism achieves robust performance on benchmark datasets, including synthetic glyphs and real-world building footprints, outperforming several baseline methods. Our findings indicate that PolyMP and PolyMP-DSC effectively capture expressive geometric features that remain invariant under common transformations, such as translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing, while also being robust to trivial vertex removals. Furthermore, we highlight the strong generalization ability of the proposed approach, enabling the transfer of learned geometric features from synthetic glyph polygons to real-world building footprints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vastextures is a vast repository of 500,000 textures and PBR materials extracted from real-world images using an unsupervised process. The extracted materials and textures are extremely diverse and cover a vast range of real-world patterns, but at the same time less refined compared to existing repositories. The repository is composed of 2D textures cropped from natural images and SVBRDF/PBR materials generated from these textures. Textures and PBR materials are essential for CGI. Existing materials repositories focus on games, animation, and arts, that demand a limited amount of high-quality assets. However, virtual worlds and synthetic data are becoming increasingly important for training A.I systems for computer vision. This application demands a huge amount of diverse assets but at the same time less affected by noisy and unrefined assets. Vastexture aims to address this need by creating a free, huge, and diverse assets repository that covers as many real-world materials as possible. The materials are automatically extracted from natural images in two steps: 1) Automatically scanning a giant amount of images to identify and crop regions with uniform textures. This is done by splitting the image into a grid of cells and identifying regions in which all of the cells share a similar statistical distribution. 2) Extracting the properties of the PBR material from the cropped texture. This is done by randomly guessing every correlation between the properties of the texture image and the properties of the PBR material. The resulting PBR materials exhibit a vast amount of real-world patterns as well as unexpected emergent properties. Neutral nets trained on this repository outperformed nets trained using handcrafted assets.

  Deep-fake videos, generated through AI face-swapping techniques, have gained significant attention due to their potential for impactful impersonation attacks. While most research focuses on real vs. fake detection, attributing a deep-fake to its specific generation model or encoder is vital for forensic analysis, enabling source tracing and tailored countermeasures. This enhances detection by leveraging model-specific artifacts and supports proactive defenses. We investigate the model attribution problem for deep-fake videos using two datasets: Deepfakes from Different Models (DFDM) and GANGen-Detection, both comprising deep-fake videos and GAN-generated images. We use only fake images from GANGen-Detection to align with DFDM's focus on attribution rather than binary classification. We formulate the task as a multiclass classification problem and introduce a novel Capsule-Spatial-Temporal (CapST) model that integrates a truncated VGG19 network for feature extraction, capsule networks for hierarchical encoding, and a spatio-temporal attention mechanism. Video-level fusion captures temporal dependencies across frames. Experiments on DFDM and GANGen-Detection show CapST outperforms baseline models in attribution accuracy while reducing computational cost.

  Automatic fingerprint recognition systems suffer from the threat of presentation attacks due to their wide range of deployment in areas including national borders and commercial applications. A presentation attack can be performed by creating a spoof of a user's fingerprint with or without their consent. This paper presents a dynamic ensemble of deep CNN and handcrafted features to detect presentation attacks in known-material and unknown-material protocols of the liveness detection competition. The proposed presentation attack detection model, in this way, utilizes the capabilities of both deep CNN and handcrafted features techniques and exhibits better performance than their individual performances. We have validated our proposed method on benchmark databases from the Liveness Detection Competition in 2015, 2017, and 2019, yielding overall accuracy of 96.10%, 96.49%, and 94.99% on them, respectively. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy.

  Visual instruction tuning large language model(LLM) on image-text pairs has achieved general-purpose vision-language abilities. However, the lack of region-text pairs limits their advancements to fine-grained multimodal understanding. In this paper, we propose spatial instruction tuning, which introduces the reference to the region-of-interest(RoI) in the instruction. Before sending to LLM, the reference is replaced by RoI features and interleaved with language embeddings as a sequence. Our model GPT4RoI, trained on 7 region-text pair datasets, brings an unprecedented interactive and conversational experience compared to previous image-level models. (1) Interaction beyond language: Users can interact with our model by both language and drawing bounding boxes to flexibly adjust the referring granularity. (2) Versatile multimodal abilities: A variety of attribute information within each RoI can be mined by GPT4RoI, e.g., color, shape, material, action, etc. Furthermore, it can reason about multiple RoIs based on common sense. On the Visual Commonsense Reasoning(VCR) dataset, GPT4RoI achieves a remarkable accuracy of 81.6%, surpassing all existing models by a significant margin (the second place is 75.6%) and almost reaching human-level performance of 85.0%.

  Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs atthis https URLto foster further research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough, e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work, we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$ produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities. Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research: rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface (AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving the broader ML community.

  We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging competitive programming tasks.

  Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns. However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the "alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to 194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

  Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3, Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names, culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%, always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies for equitable outcomes.

  Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba, that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models -- state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs), by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba) and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases exhibiting better length generalization than either.

  Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper, we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference, CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other disciplines.

  Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained. Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result, does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as well as empirical results from language model training.We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes, between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of model sizes and accelerator counts.

  Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page:this http URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However, existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise. Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL through simple reward shaping.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end, feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending, deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models: Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference, (ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to secure future adaptive DDLSs.

  Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes" interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data, and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution, real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage further study.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models. Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale memory storage and generative tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$. The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$ where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute factor.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025 ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2) answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of AI assistants in healthcare.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label. SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

  Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of the map.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models (LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1) identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem, in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such impact.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1) have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning. To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting, and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across diverse datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366, respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this GitHub repository:this https URL.

  _Yu-Jie Zhang, Peng Zhao, Masashi Sugiyama_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years. Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature (e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses, improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability, which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

  The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical training windows, with a focus on detecting seasonal trends and price spikes. We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC), XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece, Belgium, Ireland) using feature sets derived from ENTSO-E forecast data. Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness, particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other boosting models. These findings suggest that short-window training approaches, combined with boosting methods, can effectively support DAM forecasting in volatile, data-scarce environments.

Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key innovation in END lies in its learnable forward process for enhanced generative modelling. Rather than pre-specified, the forward process is parameterized through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule generation benchmarks, we demonstrate the competitive performance of END compared to several strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional generation.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a variety of tasks. However, their substantial scale leads to significant computational resource consumption during inference, resulting in high costs. Consequently, edge device inference presents a promising solution. The primary challenges of edge inference include memory usage and inference speed. This paper introduces MNN-LLM, a framework specifically designed to accelerate the deployment of large language models on mobile devices. MNN-LLM addresses the runtime characteristics of LLMs through model quantization and DRAM-Flash hybrid storage, effectively reducing memory usage. It rearranges weights and inputs based on mobile CPU instruction sets and GPU characteristics while employing strategies such as multicore load balancing, mixed-precision floating-point operations, and geometric computations to enhance performance. Notably, MNN-LLM achieves up to a 8.6x speed increase compared to current mainstream LLM-specific frameworks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning models.

  Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available atthis https URL, and the benchmark library can be accessed atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state. In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81. The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is conditioned on satellite measurements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted. Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83% and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

  Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced evaluation of agents' spatial, temporal, and logical understanding is critical yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel generative multimodal reward model specifically architected for EQA, trained via our innovative Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) strategy to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions. The generative nature of EQA-RM provides interpretable, structured reward feedback (beyond simple scalars), uniquely enabling test-time scaling to dynamically adjust evaluation granularity, from concise scores to detailed critiques of reasoning and grounding, at inference without retraining. Concurrently, we introduce EQARewardBench, a new benchmark built on OpenEQA for standardized EQA reward model assessment. Demonstrating high sample efficiency, EQA-RM (fine-tuning Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) achieves 61.9\% accuracy on EQA-RM-Bench with only 700 samples, outperforming strong proprietary baselines, including Gemini-2.5-Flash, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Haiku, and open-sourced state-of-the-art models such as RoVRM and VisualPRM.

  _Yu-Yang Qian, Yuan-Ze Xu, Zhen-Yu Zhang, Peng Zhao, Zhi-Hua Zhou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL, particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers (ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural language processing tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses, governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone, HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale feature extraction.Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for integration with classical numerical solvers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM) agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper, we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce $\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains, we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade, with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However, recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months -- remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to 205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available atthis https URL

  _Luc Raszewski, Christine De Kock_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However, they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs) is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare, and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor. MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning. Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering), a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled. DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance.

  To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model compression methods, such as quantization and pruning, are often deployed, especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent (AWP). Our experiments demonstrate that AWP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM pruning and quantization methods. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the proposed method for pruning are also provided.

  _Tina Behrouzi, Sana Tonekaboni, Rahul G. Krishnan, Anna Goldenberg_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and regret precision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However, specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available atthis https URL

  Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical out-of-distribution generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning. Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified; instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence, encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD) learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also, results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR), which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity, and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm capacities.

  Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena, such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful, nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate. To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion (NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds, comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image clustering applications.

  We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case, but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

  _Dane Williamson, Yangfeng Ji, Matthew Dwyer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning, particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers. Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with deep generative models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO.

  _Wei Li, Mengcheng Lan, Jiaxing Xu, Yiping Ke_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple data holders to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their training data with external parties. In this paradigm, workers locally update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or model parameters). While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine) participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming model convergence. Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent. Towards this purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation, assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than honest gradients do from each other. However, in heterogeneous settings, honest gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest outliers from Byzantine ones. In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines' gradients. This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamical systems modeling is a core pillar of scientific inquiry across natural and life sciences. Increasingly, dynamical system models are learned from data, rendering identifiability a paramount concept. For systems that are not identifiable from data, no guarantees can be given about their behavior under new conditions and inputs, or about possible control mechanisms to steer the system. It is known in the community that "linear ordinary differential equations (ODE) are almost surely identifiable from a single trajectory." However, this only holds for dense matrices. The sparse regime remains underexplored, despite its practical relevance with sparsity arising naturally in many biological, social, and physical systems. In this work, we address this gap by characterizing the identifiability of sparse linear ODEs. Contrary to the dense case, we show that sparse systems are unidentifiable with a positive probability in practically relevant sparsity regimes and provide lower bounds for this probability. We further study empirically how this theoretical unidentifiability manifests in state-of-the-art methods to estimate linear ODEs from data. Our results corroborate that sparse systems are also practically unidentifiable. Theoretical limitations are not resolved through inductive biases or optimization dynamics. Our findings call for rethinking what can be expected from data-driven dynamical system modeling and allows for quantitative assessments of how much to trust a learned linear ODE.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via self-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs. While sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs, they often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work, we first propose dual-state linear attention (DSLA), a novel design that maintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving historical context and one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the short-range bias typical of linear-attention architectures. To further balance efficiency and accuracy under dynamic workload conditions, we introduce DSLA-Serve, an online adaptive distillation framework that progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference time, guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering. DSLA-Serve uses a chained fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly converted DSLA layer remains consistent with previously replaced layers, preserving the overall quality. Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning, long-context QA, and text summarization demonstrate that DSLA-Serve yields 2.3x faster inference than Llama2-7B and 3.0x faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies show that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies, addressing the historical-token underrepresentation seen in prior linear attentions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings. Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad applications in offline RL and beyond.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have been shown to be effective in addressing many of the drawbacks of relying solely on the parametric memory of large language models. Recent work has demonstrated that RAG systems can be improved via fine-tuning of their retriever and generator models.

FedRAG supports state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods, offering a simple and intuitive interface and a seamless conversion from centralized to federated training tasks. FedRAG is also deeply integrated with the modern RAG ecosystem, filling a critical gap in available tools.

  Unsupervised feature selection is critical for improving clustering performance in high-dimensional data, where irrelevant features can obscure meaningful structure. In this work, we introduce the Minkowski weighted $k$-means++, a novel initialisation strategy for the Minkowski Weighted $k$-means. Our initialisation selects centroids probabilistically using feature relevance estimates derived from the data itself. Building on this, we propose two new feature selection algorithms, FS-MWK++, which aggregates feature weights across a range of Minkowski exponents to identify stable and informative features, and SFS-MWK++, a scalable variant based on subsampling. We support our approach with a theoretical guarantee under mild assumptions and extensive experiments showing that our methods consistently outperform existing alternatives.

  The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks, is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced "Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality, structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce thethis http URLsample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately 10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets. Representing a small fraction ofthis http URL's 100 million-plus image catalog, the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our evaluation publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed data sources while preserving data locality. However, the privacy of local data is always a pivotal concern and has received a lot of attention in recent research on the FL regime. Moreover, the lack of domain heterogeneity and client-specific segregation in the benchmarks remains a critical bottleneck for rigorous evaluation. In this paper, we introduce ModelNet, a novel image classification dataset constructed from the embeddings extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 model. First, we modify the CIFAR100 dataset into three client-specific variants, considering three domain heterogeneities (homogeneous, heterogeneous, and random). Subsequently, we train each client-specific subset of all three variants on the pre-trained ResNet50 model to save model parameters. In addition to multi-domain image data, we propose a new hypothesis to define the FL algorithm that can access the anonymized model parameters to preserve the local privacy in a more effective manner compared to existing ones. ModelNet is designed to simulate realistic FL settings by incorporating non-IID data distributions and client diversity design principles in the mainframe for both conventional and futuristic graph-driven FL algorithms. The three variants are ModelNet-S, ModelNet-D, and ModelNet-R, which are based on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and random data settings, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a cross-environment client-specific FL dataset along with the graph-based variant. Extensive experiments based on domain shifts and aggregation strategies show the effectiveness of the above variants, making it a practical benchmark for classical and graph-based FL research. The dataset and related code are available online.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated LoRA has emerged as a promising technique for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on distributed devices by reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, existing approaches often inadequately overlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data heterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency, particularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive federated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the convergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and communication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for federated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without requiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client resources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the LoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock convergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to approximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to state-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.

  Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into low-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the generated contrastive pairs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In continual learning scenarios, catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks is a critical issue, making it essential to effectively measure such forgetting. Recently, there has been growing interest in focusing on representation forgetting, the forgetting measured at the hidden layer. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of representation forgetting and use this analysis to better understand the behavior of continual learning. First, we introduce a new metric called representation discrepancy, which measures the difference between representation spaces constructed by two snapshots of a model trained through continual learning. We demonstrate that our proposed metric serves as an effective surrogate for the representation forgetting while remaining analytically tractable. Second, through mathematical analysis of our metric, we derive several key findings about the dynamics of representation forgetting: the forgetting occurs more rapidly to a higher degree as the layer index increases, while increasing the width of the network slows down the forgetting process. Third, we support our theoretical findings through experiments on real image datasets, including Split-CIFAR100 and ImageNet1K.

  Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal chain of thoughts with tools.

  Stock price prediction remains a complex and high-stakes task in financial analysis, traditionally addressed using statistical models or, more recently, language models. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for decomposing Large Langage Models (LLM) activations into interpretable latents. However, due to their substantial training cost, most academic research uses open-source SAEs which are only available for a restricted set of models of up to 27B parameters. SAE latents are also learned from a dataset of activations, which means they do not transfer between models. Motivated by relative representation similarity measures, we introduce Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) models, an alternative method for decomposing language model activations. To train an ITDA, we greedily construct a dictionary of language model activations on a dataset of prompts, selecting those activations which were worst approximated by matching pursuit on the existing dictionary. ITDAs can be trained in just 1% of the time required for SAEs, using 1% of the data. This allowed us to train ITDAs on Llama-3.1 70B and 405B on a single consumer GPU. ITDAs can achieve similar reconstruction performance to SAEs on some target LLMs, but generally incur a performance penalty. However, ITDA dictionaries enable cross-model comparisons, and a simple Jaccard similarity index on ITDA dictionaries outperforms existing methods like CKA, SVCCA, and relative representation similarity metrics. ITDAs provide a cheap alternative to SAEs where computational resources are limited, or when cross model comparisons are necessary. Code available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have been observed to suddenly exhibit advanced reasoning abilities during reinforcement learning (RL), resembling an ``aha moment'' triggered by simple outcome-based rewards. While RL has proven effective in eliciting such breakthroughs in tasks involving mathematics, coding, and vision, it faces significant challenges in multi-scenario games. The diversity of game rules, interaction modes, and environmental complexities often leads to policies that perform well in one scenario but fail to generalize to others. Simply combining multiple scenarios during training introduces additional challenges, such as training instability and poor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Divide-Fuse-Conquer, a framework designed to enhance generalization in multi-scenario RL. This approach starts by heuristically grouping games based on characteristics such as rules and difficulties. Specialized models are then trained for each group to excel at games in the group is what we refer to as the divide step. Next, we fuse model parameters from different groups as a new model, and continue training it for multiple groups, until the scenarios in all groups are conquered. Experiments across 18 TextArena games show that Qwen2.5-32B-Align trained with the Divide-Fuse-Conquer strategy reaches a performance level comparable to Claude3.5, achieving 7 wins and 4 draws. We hope our approach can inspire future research on using reinforcement learning to improve the generalization of LLMs.

  The comorbidities of hypertension impose a heavy burden on patients and society. Early identification is necessary to prompt intervention, but it remains a challenging task. This study aims to address this challenge by combining joint graph learning with network analysis. Motivated by this discovery, we develop a Conjoint Graph Representation Learning (CGRL) framework that: a) constructs two networks based on disease coding, including the patient network and the disease difference network. Three comorbidity network features were generated based on the basic difference network to capture the potential relationship between comorbidities and risk diseases; b) incorporates computational structure intervention and learning feature representation, CGRL was developed to predict the risks of diabetes and coronary heart disease in patients; and c) analysis the comorbidity patterns and exploring the pathways of disease progression, the pathological pathogenesis of diabetes and coronary heart disease may be revealed. The results show that the network features extracted based on the difference network are important, and the framework we proposed provides more accurate predictions than other strong models in terms of accuracy.

  We propose reinforcement learning (RL) strategies tailored for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) under strict memory and compute limits, with a particular focus on compatibility with LoRA fine-tuning. Building on early policy gradient methods with baseline subtraction, we design critic-free methods that operate on a small, informative subset of output tokens to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. We introduce S-GRPO, a stochastic variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching approach for fine-grained credit assignment. Applied to Qwen2-1.5B, our methods raise accuracy on the SVAMP benchmark from 46% to over 70% and show strong performance on multi-digit multiplication. Surprisingly, full-token GRPO under LoRA fails to improve over the base model, suggesting that selective token-level optimization may act as an implicit regularizer in low-parameter training regimes.

  Autoregressive models excel in efficiency and plug directly into the transformer ecosystem, delivering robust generalization, predictable scalability, and seamless workflows such as fine-tuning and parallelized training. However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features for expressivity, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation, especially the success of visual autoregressive methods, we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrated the potential of this method, achieving inference speedups of up to three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving high-quality generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Randomization as a mean to improve the adversarial robustness of machine learning models has recently attracted significant attention. Unfortunately, much of the theoretical analysis so far has focused on binary classification, providing only limited insights into the more complex multiclass setting. In this paper, we take a step toward closing this gap by drawing inspiration from the field of graph theory. Our analysis focuses on discrete data distributions, allowing us to cast the adversarial risk minimization problems within the well-established framework of set packing problems. By doing so, we are able to identify three structural conditions on the support of the data distribution that are necessary for randomization to improve robustness. Furthermore, we are able to construct several data distributions where (contrarily to binary classification) switching from a deterministic to a randomized solution significantly reduces the optimal adversarial risk. These findings highlight the crucial role randomization can play in enhancing robustness to adversarial attacks in multiclass classification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In multi-task Bayesian optimization, the goal is to leverage experience from optimizing existing tasks to improve the efficiency of optimizing new ones. While approaches using multi-task Gaussian processes or deep kernel transfer exist, the performance improvement is marginal when scaling beyond a moderate number of tasks. We introduce a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn from, and improve upon, previous optimization trajectories, scaling to approximately 1500 distinct tasks. Specifically, we propose a feedback loop in which an LLM is fine-tuned on the high quality solutions to specific tasks found by Bayesian optimization (BO). This LLM is then used to generate initialization points for future BO searches for new tasks. The trajectories of these new searches provide additional training data for fine-tuning the LLM, completing the loop. We evaluate our method on two distinct domains: database query optimization and antimicrobial peptide design. Results demonstrate that our approach creates a positive feedback loop, where the LLM's generated initializations gradually improve, leading to better optimization performance. As this feedback loop continues, we find that the LLM is eventually able to generate solutions to new tasks in just a few shots that are better than the solutions produced by "from scratch" by Bayesian optimization while simultaneously requiring significantly fewer oracle calls.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study multi-armed bandits under network interference, where each unit's reward depends on its own treatment and those of its neighbors in a given graph. This induces an exponentially large action space, making standard approaches computationally impractical. We propose a novel algorithm that uses the local graph structure to minimize regret. We derive a graph-dependent upper bound on cumulative regret that improves over prior work. Additionally, we provide the first lower bounds for bandits with arbitrary network interference, where each bound involves a distinct structural property of the graph. These bounds show that for both dense and sparse graphs, our algorithm is nearly optimal, with matching upper and lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. When the interference graph is unknown, a variant of our algorithm is Pareto optimal: no algorithm can uniformly outperform it across all instances. We complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments, showing that our approach outperforms the baseline methods.

  Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from rewards treated as unnormalized distributions. Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.

  Diffusion models have recently driven significant breakthroughs in generative modeling. While state-of-the-art models produce high-quality samples on average, individual samples can still be low quality. Detecting such samples without human inspection remains a challenging task. To address this, we propose a Bayesian framework for estimating generative uncertainty of synthetic samples. We outline how to make Bayesian inference practical for large, modern generative models and introduce a new semantic likelihood (evaluated in the latent space of a feature extractor) to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional sample spaces. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed generative uncertainty effectively identifies poor-quality samples and significantly outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods. Notably, our Bayesian framework can be applied post-hoc to any pretrained diffusion or flow matching model (via the Laplace approximation), and we propose simple yet effective techniques to minimize its computational overhead during sampling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a new axis along which to improve model accuracy, where additional computation is used at inference time to allow the model to think longer for more challenging problems. One promising approach for test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a model generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and these partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order to guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search process affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes more exploration. However, this diversity comes at a cost, as divergent trajectories have less KV sharing, which means they consume more memory and slow down the search process. Previous search methods either do not perform sufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high latency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS), which promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining necessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost model to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained, while incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that we retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS can achieve 1.8$\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search process, leading to 1.4$\times$ increased throughput relative to prior state-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without requiring any custom kernel implementation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph combinatorial optimization (GCO) problems are central to domains like logistics and bioinformatics. While traditional solvers dominate, large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for structured reasoning, yet struggle with complex GCO tasks requiring rigorous combinatorial analysis and multi-step deduction, often producing hallucinated steps. We first formalize the Optimal Thoughts Design (OTD) problem, which provides a structured guidance for producing high-quality intermediate reasoning steps. Building on this formulation, we introduce GraphThought, a novel framework that generates effective reasoning sequences through either heuristic-guided forward search or solver-aligned backward reasoning. By fine-tuning LLMs on these structured thought sequences, we develop Llama-GT, an 8B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GraphArena benchmark, outperforming significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3. Our results demonstrate that when scaffolded with structured reasoning priors, principled thought generation can significantly enhance LLM performance on GCO tasks without requiring increased model scale.

  In an era overwhelmed by vast amounts of data, the effective curation of web-crawl datasets is essential for optimizing model performance. This paper tackles the challenges associated with the unstructured and heterogeneous nature of such datasets. Traditional heuristic curation methods often inadequately capture complex features, resulting in biases and the exclusion of relevant data. We introduce an advanced, learning-driven approach, Ensemble Curation Of DAta ThroUgh Multimodal Operators (EcoDatum), incorporating a novel quality-guided deduplication method to ensure balanced feature distributions. EcoDatum strategically integrates various unimodal and multimodal data curation operators within a weak supervision ensemble framework, utilizing automated optimization to score each data point effectively. EcoDatum, which significantly improves the data curation quality and efficiency, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, ranked 1st on the DataComp leaderboard, with an average performance score of 0.182 across 38 diverse evaluation datasets. This represents a 28% improvement over the DataComp baseline method, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving dataset curation and model training efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present TransMLA, a framework that seamlessly converts any GQA-based pre-trained model into an MLA-based model. Our approach enables direct compatibility with DeepSeek's codebase, allowing these models to fully leverage DeepSeek-specific optimizations such as vLLM and SGlang. By compressing 93% of the KV cache in LLaMA-2-7B, TransMLA achieves a 10.6x inference speedup at an 8K context length while preserving meaningful output quality. Additionally, the model requires only 6 billion tokens for fine-tuning to regain performance on par with the original across multiple benchmarks. TransMLA offers a practical solution for migrating GQA-based models to the MLA structure. When combined with DeepSeek's advanced features, such as FP8 quantization and Multi-Token Prediction, even greater inference acceleration can be realized.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-space models (SSMs) and transformers dominate the language modeling landscape. However, they are constrained to a lower computational complexity than classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs), limiting their expressivity. In contrast, RNNs lack parallelization during training, raising fundamental questions about the trade off between parallelization and expressivity. We propose implicit SSMs, which iterate a transformation until convergence to a fixed point. Theoretically, we show that implicit SSMs implement the non-linear state-transitions of RNNs. Empirically, we find that only approximate fixed-point convergence suffices, enabling the design of a scalable training curriculum that largely retains parallelization, with full convergence required only for a small subset of tokens. Our approach demonstrates superior state-tracking capabilities on regular languages, surpassing transformers and SSMs. We further scale implicit SSMs to natural language reasoning tasks and pretraining of large-scale language models up to 1.3B parameters on 207B tokens representing, to our knowledge, the largest implicit model trained to date. Notably, our implicit models outperform their explicit counterparts on standard benchmarks. Our code is publicly available atthis http URL.

- **[Lightweight Dataset Pruning without Full Training via Example Difficulty and Prediction Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06905)**  `arXiv:2502.06905`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in deep learning rely heavily on massive datasets, leading to substantial storage and training costs. Dataset pruning aims to alleviate this demand by discarding redundant examples. However, many existing methods require training a model with a full dataset over a large number of epochs before being able to prune the dataset, which ironically makes the pruning process more expensive than just training the model on the entire dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Difficulty and Uncertainty-Aware Lightweight (DUAL) score, which aims to identify important samples from the early training stage by considering both example difficulty and prediction uncertainty. To address a catastrophic accuracy drop at an extreme pruning, we further propose a ratio-adaptive sampling using Beta distribution. Experiments on various datasets and learning scenarios such as image classification with label noise and image corruption, and model architecture generalization demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Specifically, on ImageNet-1k, our method reduces the time cost for pruning to 66% compared to previous methods while achieving a SOTA, specifically 60% test accuracy at a 90% pruning ratio. On CIFAR datasets, the time cost is reduced to just 15% while maintaining SOTA performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Language Model (LM) capabilities advance, evaluating and supervising them at scale is getting harder for humans. There is hope that other language models can automate both these tasks, which we refer to as ''AI Oversight''. We study how model similarity affects both aspects of AI oversight by proposing Chance Adjusted Probabilistic Agreement (CAPA): a metric for LM similarity based on overlap in model mistakes. Using CAPA, we first show that LLM-as-a-judge scores favor models similar to the judge, generalizing recent self-preference results. Then, we study training on LM annotations, and find complementary knowledge between the weak supervisor and strong student model plays a crucial role in gains from ''weak-to-strong generalization''. As model capabilities increase, it becomes harder to find their mistakes, and we might defer more to AI oversight. However, we observe a concerning trend -- model mistakes are becoming more similar with increasing capabilities, pointing to risks from correlated failures. Our work underscores the importance of reporting and correcting for model similarity, especially in the emerging paradigm of AI oversight.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Density ratio estimation in high dimensions can be reframed as integrating a certain quantity, the time score, over probability paths which interpolate between the two densities. In practice, the time score has to be estimated based on samples from the two densities. However, existing methods for this problem remain computationally expensive and can yield inaccurate estimates. Inspired by recent advances in generative modeling, we introduce a novel framework for time score estimation, based on a conditioning variable. Choosing the conditioning variable judiciously enables a closed-form objective function. We demonstrate that, compared to previous approaches, our approach results in faster learning of the time score and competitive or better estimation accuracies of the density ratio on challenging tasks. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees on the error of the estimated density ratio.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances have shown that statistical tests for the rank of cross-covariance matrices play an important role in causal discovery. These rank tests include partial correlation tests as special cases and provide further graphical information about latent variables. Existing rank tests typically assume that all the continuous variables can be perfectly measured, and yet, in practice many variables can only be measured after discretization. For example, in psychometric studies, the continuous level of certain personality dimensions of a person can only be measured after being discretized into order-preserving options such as disagree, neutral, and agree. Motivated by this, we propose Mixed data Permutation-based Rank Test (MPRT), which properly controls the statistical errors even when some or all variables are discretized. Theoretically, we establish the exchangeability and estimate the asymptotic null distribution by permutations; as a consequence, MPRT can effectively control the Type I error in the presence of discretization while previous methods cannot. Empirically, our method is validated by extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data to demonstrate its effectiveness as well as applicability in causal discovery.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pruning the parameters and structure of neural networks reduces the computational complexity, energy consumption, and latency during inference. Recently, a novel underlying mechanism for successful deep learning (DL) was presented based on a method that quantitatively measures the single filter performance in each layer of a DL architecture, and a new comprehensive mechanism of how deep learning works was presented. This statistical mechanics inspired viewpoint enables to reveal the macroscopic behavior of the entire network from the microscopic performance of each filter and their cooperative behavior. Herein, we demonstrate how this understanding paves the path to high quenched dilution of the convolutional layers of deep architectures without affecting their overall accuracy using applied filter cluster connections (AFCC). AFCC is exemplified on VGG-11 and EfficientNet-B0 architectures trained on CIFAR-100, and its high pruning outperforms other techniques using the same pruning magnitude. Additionally, this technique is broadened to single nodal performance and highly pruning of fully connected layers, suggesting a possible implementation to considerably reduce the complexity of over-parameterized AI tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As deep neural networks continue to excel across various domains, their black-box nature has raised concerns about transparency and trust. In particular, interpretability has become increasingly essential for applications that demand high safety and knowledge rigor, such as drug discovery, autonomous driving, and genomics. However, progress in understanding even the simplest deep neural networks - such as fully connected networks - has been limited, despite their role as foundational elements in state-of-the-art models like ResNet and Transformer. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing NeuroLogic, a novel approach for decoding interpretable logic rules from neural networks. NeuroLogic leverages neural activation patterns to capture the model's critical decision-making processes, translating them into logical rules represented by hidden predicates. Thanks to its flexible design in the grounding phase, NeuroLogic can be adapted to a wide range of neural networks. For simple fully connected neural networks, hidden predicates can be grounded in certain split patterns of original input features to derive decision-tree-like rules. For large, complex vision neural networks, NeuroLogic grounds hidden predicates into high-level visual concepts that are understandable to humans. Our empirical study demonstrates that NeuroLogic can extract global and interpretable rules from state-of-the-art models such as ResNet, a task at which existing work struggles. We believe NeuroLogic can help pave the way for understanding the black-box nature of neural networks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant persuasive capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges, remains underexplored. This paper addresses the research question: \emph{Can LLMs generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks?}To answer this, we propose a pipeline using reinforcement learning with simulated feedback, where the network's response to LLM-generated content (i.e., the reward) is simulated through a formal engagement model. This approach bypasses the temporal cost and complexity of live experiments, enabling an efficient feedback loop between the LLM and the network under study. It also allows to control over endogenous factors such as the LLM's position within the social network and the distribution of opinions on a given topic. Our approach is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. Such flexibility makes it suitable for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science.Using our framework, we analyze the performance of LLMs in generating social engagement under different conditions, showcasing their full potential in this task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we investigate the causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through the representative problem of inferring causal relationships from narratives. We find that even state-of-the-art language models rely on unreliable shortcuts, both in terms of the narrative presentation and their parametric knowledge. For example, LLMs tend to determine causal relationships based on the topological ordering of events (i.e., earlier events cause later ones), resulting in lower performance whenever events are not narrated in their exact causal order. Similarly, we demonstrate that LLMs struggle with long-term causal reasoning and often fail when the narratives are long and contain many events. Additionally, we show LLMs appear to rely heavily on their parametric knowledge at the expense of reasoning over the provided narrative. This degrades their abilities whenever the narrative opposes parametric knowledge. We extensively validate these failure modes through carefully controlled synthetic experiments, as well as evaluations on real-world narratives. Finally, we observe that explicitly generating a causal graph generally improves performance while naive chain-of-thought is ineffective. Collectively, our results distill precise failure modes of current state-of-the-art models and can pave the way for future techniques to enhance causal reasoning in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot imitation learning algorithms hold the promise of reproducing unseen behavior from as little as a single demonstration at test time. Existing practical approaches view the expert demonstration as a sequence of goals, enabling imitation with a high-level goal selector, and a low-level goal-conditioned policy. However, this framework can suffer from myopic behavior: the agent's immediate actions towards achieving individual goals may undermine long-term objectives. We introduce a novel method that mitigates this issue by directly optimizing the occupancy matching objective that is intrinsic to imitation learning. We propose to lift a goal-conditioned value function to a distance between occupancies, which are in turn approximated via a learned world model. The resulting method can learn from offline, suboptimal data, and is capable of non-myopic, zero-shot imitation, as we demonstrate in complex, continuous benchmarks.

  In industry, the reliability of rotating machinery is critical for production efficiency and safety. Current methods of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) often rely on task-specific models, which face significant challenges in handling diverse datasets with varying signal characteristics, fault modes and operating conditions. Inspired by advancements in generative pretrained models, we propose RmGPT, a unified model for diagnosis and prognosis tasks. RmGPT introduces a novel generative token-based framework, incorporating Signal Tokens, Prompt Tokens, Time-Frequency Task Tokens and Fault Tokens to handle heterogeneous data within a unified model architecture. We leverage self-supervised learning for robust feature extraction and introduce a next signal token prediction pretraining strategy, alongside efficient prompt learning for task-specific adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RmGPT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving near-perfect accuracy in diagnosis tasks and exceptionally low errors in prognosis tasks. Notably, RmGPT excels in few-shot learning scenarios, achieving 82\% accuracy in 16-class one-shot experiments, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. This work establishes RmGPT as a powerful PHM foundation model for rotating machinery, advancing the scalability and generalizability of PHM solutions. \textbf{Code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multimodal learning strategies primarily optimize in the original token space. Such a framework is easy to incorporate with the backbone of pretrained language model, but might result in modality collapse. To alleviate such issues, we leverage the joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) on the multimodal tasks, which converts the input embedding into the output embedding space by a predictor and then conducts the cross-modal alignment on the latent space. We implement this predictor by a Multi-Gate Mixture of Experts (MMoE) and name the framework as M3-JEPA, accordingly. The gating function disentangles the modality-specific and shared information and derives information-theoretic optimality. The framework is implemented with both contrastive and regularization loss, and solved by alternative gradient descent (AGD) between different multimodal tasks. By thoroughly designed experiments, we show that M3-JEPA can obtain state-of-the-art performance on different modalities and tasks, generalize to unseen datasets and domains, and is computationally efficient in both training and inference. Our observation suggests that M3-JEPA might become a new basis to self-supervised learning in the open world.

  Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as simulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis testing. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach to time series generation, enabling diverse synthesis scenarios. However, the fixed standard-Gaussian diffusion prior may be ill-suited for general time series data, such as temporal order and fixed points. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that flexibly synthesizes time series data by using diffusion bridges to learn paths between a chosen prior and the data distribution. We then explore several prior designs tailored to time series synthesis. Our framework covers (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional generation and (ii) scale-preserving priors for conditional generation. Experiments show that our framework with data-driven priors outperforms standard diffusion models on time series generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has increasingly highlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existing objects in the images. To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either costly training or fine-tuning, or API access to proprietary LLMs for post-generation correction. In response to these limitations, we propose Mitigating hallucinAtion via image-gRounded guIdaNcE (MARINE), a framework that is both training-free and API-free. MARINE effectively and efficiently reduces object hallucinations during inference by introducing image-grounded guidance to LVLMs. This is achieved by leveraging open-source vision models to extract object-level information, thereby enhancing the precision of LVLM-generated content. Our framework's flexibility further allows for the integration of multiple vision models, enabling more reliable and robust object-level guidance. Through comprehensive evaluations across 5 popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics and benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably, it reduces hallucinations consistently in GPT-4V-assisted evaluation while maintaining the detailedness of LVLMs' generations. We release our code atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Center-based clustering has attracted significant research interest from both theory and practice. In many practical applications, input data often contain background knowledge that can be used to improve clustering results. In this work, we build on widely adopted $k$-center clustering and model its input background knowledge as must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraint sets. However, most clustering problems including $k$-center are inherently $\mathcal{NP}$-hard, while the more complex constrained variants are known to suffer severer approximation and computation barriers that significantly limit their applicability. By employing a suite of techniques including reverse dominating sets, linear programming (LP) integral polyhedron, and LP duality, we arrive at the first efficient approximation algorithm for constrained $k$-center with the best possible ratio of 2. We also construct competitive baseline algorithms and empirically evaluate our approximation algorithm against them on a variety of real datasets. The results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the great advantages of our algorithm in terms of clustering cost, clustering quality, and running time.

  Class imbalance severely impacts machine learning performance on minority classes in real-world applications. While various solutions exist, active learning offers a fundamental fix by strategically collecting balanced, informative labeled examples from abundant unlabeled data. We introduce DIRECT, an algorithm that identifies class separation boundaries and selects the most uncertain nearby examples for annotation. By reducing the problem to one-dimensional active learning, DIRECT leverages established theory to handle batch labeling and label noise -- another common challenge in data annotation that particularly affects active learning methods. Our work presents the first comprehensive study of active learning under both class imbalance and label noise. Extensive experiments on imbalanced datasets show DIRECT reduces annotation costs by over 60\% compared to state-of-the-art active learning methods and over 80\% versus random sampling, while maintaining robustness to label noise.

  Communication-efficient variants of SGD, specifically local SGD, have received a great deal of interest in recent years. These approaches compute multiple gradient steps locally on each worker, before averaging model parameters, helping relieve the critical communication bottleneck in distributed deep learning training. Although many variants of these approaches have been proposed, they can sometimes lag behind state-of-the-art adaptive optimizers for deep learning. In this work, we investigate if the recent progress in the emerging area of learned optimizers can potentially close this gap in homogeneous data and homogeneous device settings while remaining communication-efficient. Specifically, we meta-learn how to perform global updates given an update from local SGD iterations. Our results demonstrate that learned optimizers can substantially outperform local SGD and its sophisticated variants while maintaining their communication efficiency. Our learned optimizers can even generalize to unseen and much larger datasets and architectures, including ImageNet and ViTs, and to unseen modalities such as language modeling. We therefore show the potential of learned optimizers for improving communication-efficient distributed learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However, existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a 360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors. We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation in real-world settings remains challenging, especially regarding robust generalization. Existing simulation platforms lack sufficient support for exploring how policies adapt to varied instructions and scenarios. Thus, they lag behind the growing interest in instruction-following foundation models like LLMs, whose adaptability is crucial yet remains underexplored in fair comparisons. To bridge this gap, we introduce GenManip, a realistic tabletop simulation platform tailored for policy generalization studies. It features an automatic pipeline via LLM-driven task-oriented scene graph to synthesize large-scale, diverse tasks using 10K annotated 3D object assets. To systematically assess generalization, we present GenManip-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios refined via human-in-the-loop corrections. We evaluate two policy types: (1) modular manipulation systems integrating foundation models for perception, reasoning, and planning, and (2) end-to-end policies trained through scalable data collection. Results show that while data scaling benefits end-to-end methods, modular systems enhanced with foundation models generalize more effectively across diverse scenarios. We anticipate this platform to facilitate critical insights for advancing policy generalization in realistic conditions. Project Page:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Vib2Move, a novel approach for in-hand object reconfiguration that uses fingertip micro-vibrations and gravity to precisely reposition planar objects. Our framework comprises three key innovations. First, we design a vibration-based actuator that dynamically modulates the effective finger-object friction coefficient, effectively emulating changes in gripping force. Second, we derive a sliding motion model for objects clamped in a parallel gripper with two symmetric, variable-friction contact patches. Third, we propose a motion planner that coordinates end-effector finger trajectories and fingertip vibrations to achieve the desired object pose. In real-world trials, Vib2Move consistently yields final positioning errors below 6 mm, demonstrating reliable, high-precision manipulation across a variety of planar objects.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With increasing efficiency and reliability, autonomous systems are becoming valuable assistants to humans in various tasks. In the context of robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair strategies impact human trust. In this task, while handling a secondary task, humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually control it. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long explanations, apology and promise, and denial.Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at preventing trust loss.We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) are increasingly vital for marine science, offering robust platforms for underwater mapping and inspection. Accurate state estimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor mapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences when sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate partial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on relative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily observe a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to estimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides yaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these measurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating such partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF implementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly relevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a "seafaring plane." This paper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based roll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state estimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full orientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF). Our results demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed partial orientation measurements for accurate ASV state estimation in open ocean environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous, irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion, safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page isthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation, but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches. This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation, combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy, particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.

  _Yuhang Zhang, Haosheng Yu, Jiaping Xiao, Mir Feroskhan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM) that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover, real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the presence of abstract language input.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research.

  _Ana M√ºller, Sabina Jeschke, Anja Richert_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the impact of a group-adaptive conversation design in two socially interactive agents (SIAs) through two real-world studies. Both SIAs - Furhat, a social robot, and MetaHuman, a virtual agent - were equipped with a conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) backend combining hybrid retrieval and generative models. The studies were carried out in an in-the-wild setting with a total of $N = 188$ participants who interacted with the SIAs - in dyads, triads or larger groups - at a German museum. Although the results did not reveal a significant effect of the group-sensitive conversation design on perceived satisfaction, the findings provide valuable insights into the challenges of adapting CAI for multi-party interactions and across different embodiments (robot vs.\ virtual agent), highlighting the need for multimodal strategies beyond linguistic pluralization. These insights contribute to the fields of Human-Agent Interaction (HAI), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and broader Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), providing insights for future research on effective dialogue adaptation in group settings.

- **[Towards more efficient quantitative safety validation of residual risk for assisted and automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10363)**  `arXiv:2506.10363`  
  _Daniel Betschinske, Malte Schrimpf, Steven Peters, Kamil Klonecki, Jan Peter Karch, Moritz Lippert_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The safety validation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving Systems (ADS) increasingly demands efficient and reliable methods to quantify residual risk while adhering to international standards such as ISO 21448. Traditionally, Field Operational Testing (FOT) has been pivotal for macroscopic safety validation of automotive driving functions up to SAE automation level 2. However, state-of-the-art derivations for empirical safety demonstrations using FOT often result in impractical testing efforts, particularly at higher automation levels. Even at lower automation levels, this limitation - coupled with the substantial costs associated with FOT - motivates the exploration of approaches to enhance the efficiency of FOT-based macroscopic safety validation. Therefore, this publication systematically identifies and evaluates state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT, including novel methods reported in the literature. Based on an analysis of ISO 21448, two models are derived: a generic model capturing the argumentation components of the standard, and a base model, exemplarily applied to Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems, establishing a baseline for the real-world driving requirement for a Quantitative Safety Validation of Residual Risk (QSVRR). Subsequently, the RAs are assessed using four criteria: quantifiability, threats to validity, missing links, and black box compatibility, highlighting potential benefits, inherent limitations, and identifying key areas for further research. Our evaluation reveals that, while several approaches offer potential, none are free from missing links or other substantial shortcomings. Moreover, no identified alternative can fully replace FOT, reflecting its crucial role in the safety validation of ADAS and ADS.

  _Che Wang, Jeroen van Baar, Chaitanya Mitash, Shuai Li, Dylan Randle, Weiyao Wang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance. Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes, and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference, only a subset of them can be used as input.

  Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings. We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning algorithms often struggle to control complex real-world systems. In the case of nuclear fusion, these challenges are exacerbated, as the dynamics are notoriously complex, data is poor, hardware is subject to failures, and experiments often affect dynamics beyond the experiment's duration. Existing tools like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and Bayesian optimization address some of these challenges but fail to provide a comprehensive solution. To overcome these limitations, we present a multi-scale Bayesian optimization approach that integrates a high-frequency data-driven dynamics model with a low-frequency Gaussian process. By updating the Gaussian process between experiments, the method rapidly adapts to new data, refining the predictions of the less reliable dynamical model. We validate our approach by controlling tearing instabilities in the DIII-D nuclear fusion plant. Offline testing on historical data shows that our method significantly outperforms several baselines. Results on live experiments on the DIII-D tokamak, conducted under high-performance plasma scenarios prone to instabilities, shows a 50% success rate, marking a 117% improvement over historical outcomes.

  Probabilistic Virtual Fixtures (VFs) enable the adaptive selection of the most suitable haptic feedback for each phase of a task, based on learned or perceived uncertainty. While keeping the human in the loop remains essential, for instance, to ensure high precision, partial automation of certain task phases is critical for productivity. We present a unified framework for probabilistic VFs that seamlessly switches between manual fixtures, semi-automated fixtures (with the human handling precise tasks), and full autonomy. We introduce a novel probabilistic Dynamical System-based VF for coarse guidance, enabling the robot to autonomously complete certain task phases while keeping the human operator in the loop. For tasks requiring precise guidance, we extend probabilistic position-based trajectory fixtures with automation allowing for seamless human interaction as well as geometry-awareness and optimal impedance gains. For manual tasks requiring very precise guidance, we also extend visual servoing fixtures with the same geometry-awareness and impedance behaviour. We validate our approach experimentally on different robots, showcasing multiple operation modes and the ease of programming fixtures.

  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.

  Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests. This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas, enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches - Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation frameworks.

  Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humanoid robots have demonstrated robust locomotion capabilities using Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches. Further, to obtain human-like behaviors, existing methods integrate human motion-tracking or motion prior in the RL framework. However, these methods are limited in flat terrains with proprioception only, restricting their abilities to traverse challenging terrains with human-like gaits. In this work, we propose a novel framework using a mixture of latent residual experts with multi-discriminators to train an RL policy, which is capable of traversing complex terrains in controllable lifelike gaits with exteroception. Our two-stage training pipeline first teaches the policy to traverse complex terrains using a depth camera, and then enables gait-commanded switching between human-like gait patterns. We also design gait rewards to adjust human-like behaviors like robot base height. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our framework exhibits exceptional performance in traversing complex terrains, and achieves seamless transitions between multiple human-like gait patterns.

  Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically, we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks.

  We present a unified gait-conditioned reinforcement learning framework that enables humanoid robots to perform standing, walking, running, and smooth transitions within a single recurrent policy. A compact reward routing mechanism dynamically activates gait-specific objectives based on a one-hot gait ID, mitigating reward interference and supporting stable multi-gait learning. Human-inspired reward terms promote biomechanically natural motions, such as straight-knee stance and coordinated arm-leg swing, without requiring motion capture data. A structured curriculum progressively introduces gait complexity and expands command space over multiple phases. In simulation, the policy successfully achieves robust standing, walking, running, and gait transitions. On the real Unitree G1 humanoid, we validate standing, walking, and walk-to-stand transitions, demonstrating stable and coordinated locomotion. This work provides a scalable, reference-free solution toward versatile and naturalistic humanoid control across diverse modes and environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world validation hinders accurate perception and robust step-by-step reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce AgentThink, a pioneering unified framework that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: (i) Structured Data Generation, by establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; (ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and (iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by 53.91% and enhances answer accuracy by 33.54%, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous driving models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning by imitation provides an effective way for robots to develop well-regulated complex behaviors and directly benefit from natural demonstrations. State-of-the-art imitation learning (IL) approaches typically leverage Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP), which, despite their impressive results, suffer from two key limitations. They are prone to mode collapse, which often leads to overfitting to the simulation environment and thus increased sim-to-real gap, and they struggle to learn diverse behaviors effectively. To overcome these limitations, we introduce APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient eXploration): a simple yet versatile IL framework that integrates demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL), maintaining high exploration while grounding behavior with expert-informed priors. We achieve this through a combination of decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is complemented by a multi-critic RL framework that effectively balances stylistic consistency with task performance. Our approach achieves sample-efficient IL and enables the acquisition of diverse skills within a single policy. APEX generalizes to varying velocities and preserves reference-like styles across complex tasks such as navigating rough terrain and climbing stairs, utilizing only flat-terrain kinematic motion data as a prior. We validate our framework through extensive hardware experiments on the Unitree Go2 quadruped. There, APEX yields diverse and agile locomotion gaits, inherent gait transitions, and the highest reported speed for the platform to the best of our knowledge (peak velocity of ~3.3 m/s on hardware). Our results establish APEX as a compelling alternative to existing IL methods, offering better efficiency, adaptability, and real-world performance.this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (AEOSSP) entails finding the subset of observation targets to be scheduled along the satellite's orbit while meeting operational constraints of time, energy and memory. The problem of deciding what and when to observe is inherently complex, and becomes even more challenging when considering several issues that compromise the quality of the captured images, such as cloud occlusion, atmospheric turbulence, and image resolution. This paper presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for addressing the AEOSSP with time-dependent profits, integrating these three factors to optimize the use of energy and memory resources. The proposed method involves a dual decision-making process: selecting the sequence of targets and determining the optimal observation time for each. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the capture of images that fail to meet quality requirements by > 60% and consequently decreases energy waste from attitude maneuvers by up to 78%, all while maintaining strong observation performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various robotic tasks; however, its deployment in real-world scenarios, particularly in contact-rich environments, often overlooks critical safety and stability aspects. Policies without passivity guarantees can result in system instability, posing risks to robots, their environments, and human operators. In this work, we investigate the limitations of traditional RL policies when deployed in contact-rich tasks and explore the combination of energy-based passive control with safe RL in both training and deployment to answer these challenges. Firstly, we reveal the discovery that standard RL policy does not satisfy stability in contact-rich scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a \textit{passivity-aware} RL policy training with energy-based constraints in our safe RL formulation. Lastly, a passivity filter is exerted on the policy output for \textit{passivity-ensured} control during deployment. We conduct comparative studies on a contact-rich robotic maze exploration task, evaluating the effects of learning passivity-aware policies and the importance of passivity-ensured control. The experiments demonstrate that a passivity-agnostic RL policy easily violates energy constraints in deployment, even though it achieves high task completion in training. The results show that our proposed approach guarantees control stability through passivity filtering and improves the energy efficiency through passivity-aware training. A video of real-world experiments is available as supplementary material. We also release the checkpoint model and offline data for pre-training at \href{this https URL}{Hugging Face}.

  Robotic systems' mobility is constrained by power sources and wiring. While pneumatic actuators remain tethered to air supplies, we developed a new actuator utilizing light energy. Inspired by nocturnal animals' eyes, we designed a bilayer soft actuator incorporating Laser-Induced Graphene (LIG) on the inner surface of a silicone layer. This design maintains silicone's transparency and flexibility while achieving 54% faster response time compared to conventional actuators through enhanced photothermal conversion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robots navigating indoor environments often have access to architectural plans, which can serve as prior knowledge to enhance their localization and mapping capabilities. While some SLAM algorithms leverage these plans for global localization in real-world environments, they typically overlook a critical challenge: the "as-planned" architectural designs frequently deviate from the "as-built" real-world environments. To address this gap, we present a novel algorithm that tightly couples LIDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping with architectural plans under the presence of deviations. Our method utilizes a multi-layered semantic representation to not only localize the robot, but also to estimate global alignment and structural deviations between "as-planned" and as-built environments in real-time. To validate our approach, we performed experiments in simulated and real datasets demonstrating robustness to structural deviations up to 35 cm and 15 degrees. On average, our method achieves 43% less localization error than baselines in simulated environments, while in real environments, the as-built 3D maps show 7% lower average alignment error

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great success as foundational models for downstream vision and natural language applications in a variety of domains. However, these models are limited to reasoning over objects and actions currently visible on the image plane. We present a spatial extension to the VLM, which leverages spatially-localized egocentric video demonstrations to augment VLMs in two ways -- through understanding spatial task-affordances, i.e. where an agent must be for the task to physically take place, and the localization of that task relative to the egocentric viewer. We show our approach outperforms the baseline of using a VLM to map similarity of a task's description over a set of location-tagged images. Our approach has less error both on predicting where a task may take place and on predicting what tasks are likely to happen at the current location. The resulting representation will enable robots to use egocentric sensing to navigate to, or around, physical regions of interest for novel tasks specified in natural language.
