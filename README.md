- **[RoboEgo System Card: An Omnimodal Model with Native Full Duplexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01934)**  `arXiv:2506.01934`  
  _Yiqun Yao, Xiang Li, Xin Jiang, Xuezhi Fang, Naitong Yu, Aixin Sun, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans naturally process real-world multimodal information in a full-duplex manner. In artificial intelligence, replicating this capability is essential for advancing model development and deployment, particularly in embodied contexts. The development of multimodal models faces two primary challenges: (1) effectively handling more than three modalities-such as vision, audio, and text; and (2) delivering full-duplex responses to rapidly evolving human instructions. To facilitate research on models that support both omnimodal processing and full duplexity, we present RoboEgo (alias: FLM-Ego), a unified model system designed to address both challenges. RoboEgo incorporates a backbone architecture and algorithms that natively support full duplexity, achieving a theoretical duplex latency of 80 ms. In streaming visually grounded conversations under real-world conditions, RoboEgo exhibits superior responsiveness and speech naturalness, while maintaining comparable content qualities to state-of-the-art semi-duplex omnimodal models-a feat previously considered unattainable by native full-duplex systems.

- **[Large language models can learn and generalize steganographic chain-of-thought under process supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01926)**  `arXiv:2506.01926`  
  _Joey Skaf, Luis Ibanez-Lissen, Robert McCarthy, Connor Watts, Vasil Georgiv, Hannes Whittingham, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning not only enhances large language model performance but also provides critical insights into decision-making processes, marking it as a useful tool for monitoring model intent and planning. By proactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or harmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with deploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the appearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or regulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a specific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT presentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes obfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the undesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT monitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization to latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide an extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of specific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to substitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying method by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can learn to steganographically encode its reasoning. We further demonstrate that models can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to an overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in training, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the class which it can apply to held-out testing strings.

- **[Understanding Overadaptation in Supervised Fine-Tuning: The Role of Ensemble Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01901)**  `arXiv:2506.01901`  
  _Yifan Hao, Xingyuan Pan, Hanning Zhang, Chenlu Ye, Rui Pan, Tong Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on domain-specific data is the dominant approach for adapting foundation models to specialized tasks. However, it has been observed that SFT models tend to forget knowledge acquired during pretraining. In vision models, ensembling a pretrained model with its fine-tuned counterpart has been shown to mitigate this issue. In this work, we demonstrate that the same holds for language models, and, more strikingly, we observe an overadaptation phenomenon: the ensemble model not only retains general knowledge from the foundation model but also outperforms the fine-tuned model even on the fine-tuning domain itself. Despite the empirical success of ensembling, a theoretical understanding of its benefits remains underexplored. We develop a formal theoretical analysis of the overadaptation phenomenon. Ensembling mitigates this by balancing two primary sources of error: bias, caused by insufficient fine-tuning, and variance, introduced by overfitting to fine-tuning data. While regularization techniques aim to address this trade-off, we show that ensembling provides a more effective solution. We analyze this phenomenon in over-parameterized linear settings and demonstrate that interpolating between pretrained and fine-tuned weights significantly improves performance. These findings offer theoretical justification for the observed advantages of model ensembling, supported by empirical experiments consistent with our analysis.

- **[WHEN TO ACT, WHEN TO WAIT: Modeling Structural Trajectories for Intent Triggerability in Task-Oriented Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01881)**  `arXiv:2506.01881`  
  _Yaoyao Qian, Jindan Huang, Yuanli Wang, Simon Yu, Kyrie Zhixuan Zhou, Jiayuan Mao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.

  _Tim Woydt, Moritz Willig, Antonia W√ºst, Lukas Helff, Wolfgang Stammer, Constantin A. Rothkopf, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Strong meta-learning capabilities for systematic compositionality are emerging as an important skill for navigating the complex and changing tasks of today's world. However, in presenting models for robust adaptation to novel environments, it is important to refrain from making unsupported claims about the performance of meta-learning systems that ultimately do not stand up to scrutiny. While Fodor and Pylyshyn famously posited that neural networks inherently lack this capacity as they are unable to model compositional representations or structure-sensitive operations, and thus are not a viable model of the human mind, Lake and Baroni recently presented meta-learning as a pathway to compositionality. In this position paper, we critically revisit this claim and highlight limitations in the proposed meta-learning framework for compositionality. Our analysis shows that modern neural meta-learning systems can only perform such tasks, if at all, under a very narrow and restricted definition of a meta-learning setup. We therefore claim that `Fodor and Pylyshyn's legacy' persists, and to date, there is no human-like systematic compositionality learned in neural networks.

- **[The Ultimate Test of Superintelligent AI Agents: Can an AI Balance Care and Control in Asymmetric Relationships?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01813)**  `arXiv:2506.01813`  
  _Djallel Bouneffouf, Matthew Riemer, Kush Varshney_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces the Shepherd Test, a new conceptual test for assessing the moral and relational dimensions of superintelligent artificial agents. The test is inspired by human interactions with animals, where ethical considerations about care, manipulation, and consumption arise in contexts of asymmetric power and self-preservation. We argue that AI crosses an important, and potentially dangerous, threshold of intelligence when it exhibits the ability to manipulate, nurture, and instrumentally use less intelligent agents, while also managing its own survival and expansion goals. This includes the ability to weigh moral trade-offs between self-interest and the well-being of subordinate agents. The Shepherd Test thus challenges traditional AI evaluation paradigms by emphasizing moral agency, hierarchical behavior, and complex decision-making under existential stakes. We argue that this shift is critical for advancing AI governance, particularly as AI systems become increasingly integrated into multi-agent environments. We conclude by identifying key research directions, including the development of simulation environments for testing moral behavior in AI, and the formalization of ethical manipulation within multi-agent systems.

- **[A Study on the MCP x A2A Framework for Enhancing Interoperability of LLM-based Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01804)**  `arXiv:2506.01804`  
  _Cheonsu Jeong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper provides an in-depth technical analysis and implementation methodology of the open-source Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol developed by Google and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by Anthropic. While the evolution of LLM-based autonomous agents is rapidly accelerating, efficient interactions among these agents and their integration with external systems remain significant challenges. In modern AI systems, collaboration between autonomous agents and integration with external tools have become essential elements for building practical AI applications. A2A offers a standardized communication method that enables agents developed in heterogeneous environments to collaborate effectively, while MCP provides a structured I/O framework for agents to connect with external tools and resources. Prior studies have focused primarily on the features and applications of either A2A or MCP individually. In contrast, this study takes an integrated approach, exploring how the two protocols can complement each other to address interoperability issues and facilitate efficient collaboration within complex agent ecosystems.

- **[Self-Challenging Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01716)**  `arXiv:2506.01716`  
  _Yifei Zhou, Sergey Levine, Jason Weston, Xian Li, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models are quickly becoming the foundation for intelligent agents that are capable of using tools. However, training such agents is challenging because it requires human creation and annotation of a diverse set of tasks, tools, and evaluation criteria. In this paper, we propose the Self-Challenging framework for training an agent on high-quality tasks that are generated by itself. The agent first plays the role of challenger and generates a task after interacting with the given tools. The tasks take the form of a novel general class of problems termed Code-as-Task, which are defined by an instruction, a verification function and solution and failure cases which serve as tests, allowing to filter only for high-quality tasks. The agent then takes an executor role and trains on those tasks with reinforcement learning using the evaluation feedback as a reward. Evaluation on two existing multi-turn tool-use agent benchmarks, M3ToolEval and TauBench, shows the Self-Challenging framework achieves over a two-fold improvement in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, despite using only self-generated training data.

  _Jiongnan Liu, Zhicheng Dou, Ning Hu, Chenyan Xiong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To address the challenge of information overload from massive web contents, recommender systems are widely applied to retrieve and present personalized results for users. However, recommendation tasks are inherently constrained to filtering existing items and lack the ability to generate novel concepts, limiting their capacity to fully satisfy user demands and preferences. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably, the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.

- **[A Descriptive and Normative Theory of Human Beliefs in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01692)**  `arXiv:2506.01692`  
  _Sylee Dandekar, Shripad Deshmukh, Frank Chiu, W. Bradley Knox, Scott Niekum_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.

  _Shuting Wang, Yunqi Liu, Zixin Yang, Ning Hu, Zhicheng Dou, Chenyan Xiong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Querying generative AI models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), has become a prevalent method for information acquisition. However, existing query-answer datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark, RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V) models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds 4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries, pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Societies worldwide are rapidly entering a super-aged era, making elderly health a pressing concern. The aging population is increasing the burden on national economies and households. Dementia cases are rising significantly with this demographic shift. Recent research using voice-based models and large language models (LLM) offers new possibilities for dementia diagnosis and treatment. Our Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning method combines speech and language models. The process starts with automatic speech recognition to convert speech to text. We add a linear layer to an LLM for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD classification, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with CoT reasoning and cues. This approach showed an 16.7% relative performance improvement compared to methods without CoT prompt reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance in CoT approaches.

  _Chong Li, Chenglin Zhu, Tao Zhang, Mingan Lin, Zenan Zhou, Jian Xie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities in various visual tasks. However, their abilities in K12 scenarios are still systematically underexplored. Previous studies suffer from various limitations including narrow subject coverage, insufficient data scale, lack of diversity in question types, and naive answer-centric evaluation method, resulting in insufficient exploration of model capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose K12Vista, the most comprehensive multimodal benchmark for Chinese K12 subject knowledge understanding and reasoning to date, featuring 33,000 questions across five core subjects from primary to high school and three question types. Moreover, beyond the final outcome, we are also concerned with the correctness of MLLMs' reasoning processes. For this purpose, we meticulously compiles errors from MLLMs' reasoning processes and leverage an automated data pipeline to construct K12-PEM-800K, the largest process evaluation dataset offering detailed step-by-step judgement annotations for MLLMs' reasoning. Subsequently, we developed K12-PEM, an advanced process evaluation model that integrates an overall assessment of both the reasoning process and answer correctness. Moreover, we also introduce K12-PEBench, the first high-quality, human-annotated benchmark specifically designed for evaluating abilities of reasoning processthis http URLexperiments reveal that current MLLMs exhibit significant flaws when reasoning within K12Vista, providing critical insights for the development of more capablethis http URLopen our resources atthis https URL.

  _Mustafa Mert √áelikok, Saptarashmi Bandyopadhyay, Robert Loftin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of AI agents based on large, open-domain language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of general-purpose AI assistants that can support human in tasks such as writing, coding, graphic design, and scientific research. A major challenge with such agents is that, by necessity, they are trained by observing relatively short-term interactions with humans. Such models can fail to generalize to long-term interactions, for example, interactions where a user has repeatedly corrected mistakes on the part of the agent. In this work, we argue that these challenges can be overcome by explicitly modeling humans' social intelligence, that is, their ability to build and maintain long-term relationships with other agents whose behavior cannot always be predicted. By mathematically modeling the strategies humans use to communicate and reason about one another over long periods of time, we may be able to derive new game theoretic objectives against which LLMs and future AI agents may be optimized.

- **[MAGIK: Mapping to Analogous Goals via Imagination-enabled Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01623)**  `arXiv:2506.01623`  
  _Ajsal Shereef Palattuparambil, Thommen George Karimpanal, Santu Rana_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer via imagination-based analogy mapping.

- **[MLA-Trust: Benchmarking Trustworthiness of Multimodal LLM Agents in GUI Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01616)**  `arXiv:2506.01616`  
  _Xiao Yang, Jiawei Chen, Jun Luo, Zhengwei Fang, Yinpeng Dong, Hang Su, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) has transformed interaction paradigms by seamlessly integrating vision, language, action and dynamic environments, enabling unprecedented autonomous capabilities across GUI applications ranging from web automation to mobile systems. However, MLAs introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving 13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse interactive environments.

  _Zouying Cao, Runze Wang, Yifei Yang, Xinbei Ma, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in handling complex interactive problems. Existing LLM agents mainly generate natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents' ability to generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans (P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style Planning Guided Preference Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning. With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents' ability to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks and outperforms the current leading baselines. Analyses reveal the advantage of PGPO in reducing action errors and omissions during reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven breakthroughs in AI, from game-play to scientific discovery and AI alignment. However, its broader applicability remains limited by challenges such as low data efficiency and poor generalizability. Recent advances suggest that large language models, with their rich world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, could complement RL by enabling semantic state modeling and task-agnostic planning. In this work, we propose the Agentic Episodic Control (AEC), a novel architecture that integrates RL with LLMs to enhance decision-making. The AEC can leverage a large language model (LLM) to map the observations into language-grounded embeddings, which further can be stored in an episodic memory for rapid retrieval of high-value experiences. Simultaneously, a World-Graph working memory module is utilized to capture structured environmental dynamics in order to enhance relational reasoning. Furthermore, a lightweight critical state detector dynamically arbitrates between the episodic memory recall and the world-model-guided exploration. On the whole, by combining the trial-and-error learning scheme with LLM-derived semantic priors, the proposed AEC can improve both data efficiency and generalizability in reinforcement learning. In experiments on BabyAI-Text benchmark tasks, AEC demonstrates substantial improvements over existing baselines, especially on complex and generalization tasks like FindObj, where it outperforms the best baseline by up to 76%. The proposed AEC framework bridges the strengths of numeric reinforcement learning and symbolic reasoning, which provides a pathway toward more adaptable and sample-efficient agents.

- **[Distinguishing Autonomous AI Agents from Collaborative Agentic Systems: A Comprehensive Framework for Understanding Modern Intelligent Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01438)**  `arXiv:2506.01438`  
  _Prashik Buddhaghosh Bansod_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of large language models has catalyzed two distinct yet interconnected paradigms in artificial intelligence: standalone AI Agents and collaborative Agentic AI ecosystems. This comprehensive study establishes a definitive framework for distinguishing these architectures through systematic analysis of their operational principles, structural compositions, and deployment methodologies. We characterize AI Agents as specialized, tool-enhanced systems leveraging foundation models for targeted automation within constrained environments. Conversely, Agentic AI represents sophisticated multi-entity frameworks where distributed agents exhibit emergent collective intelligence through coordinated interaction protocols. Our investigation traces the evolutionary trajectory from traditional rule-based systems through generative AI foundations to contemporary agent architectures. We present detailed architectural comparisons examining planning mechanisms, memory systems, coordination protocols, and decision-making processes. The study categorizes application landscapes, contrasting single-agent implementations in customer service and content management with multi-agent deployments in research automation and complex decision support. We identify critical challenges including reliability issues, coordination complexities, and scalability constraints, while proposing innovative solutions through enhanced reasoning frameworks, robust memory architectures, and improved coordination mechanisms. This framework provides essential guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate agentic approaches and establishes foundational principles for next-generation intelligent system development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist represents a paradigm shift in scientific discovery, with large language models (LLMs) taking the lead as the primary executor in the entire scientific workflow from idea generation to experiment implementation. Recent AI Scientist studies demonstrate sufficient capabilities for independent scientific discovery, with the generated research reports gaining acceptance at the ICLR 2025 workshop and ACL 2025, arguing that a human-level AI Scientist, capable of uncovering phenomena previously unknown to humans, may be imminent. Despite this substantial progress, AI Scientist has yet to produce a groundbreaking achievement in the domain of computer science on par with automated scientific tools. Based on extensive quantitative evidence from existing benchmarks in complex engineering tasks and a systematic evaluation assess 28 research papers generated by five advanced AI Scientist systems, we argue that \textbf{the fundamental bottleneck for AI Scientists lies in their capability to execute the requisite verification procedures.} Current AI Scientist systems lack the execution capabilities needed to execute rigorous experiments and produce high-quality scientific papers. To better illustrate the root cause of this \textbf{implementation gap}, we provide an in-depth discussion on the fundamental limitations of AI Scientist. This position paper aims to call for the participants in the community to bridge the implementation gap.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in particular electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain --the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of 66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer interface with multiple modalities. All data, tools, and acquisition protocols are openly shared to foster open science in cognitive computing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems that simulate real-world interactions with near-human reasoning. While previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online environments.

  Operations research (OR) is widely deployed to solve critical decision-making problems with complex objectives and constraints, impacting manufacturing, logistics, finance, and healthcare outcomes. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in various domains, their practical application in industry-relevant operations research (OR) problems presents significant challenges and opportunities. Preliminary industrial applications of LLMs for operations research face two critical deployment challenges: 1) Self-correction focuses on code syntax rather than mathematical accuracy, causing costly errors; 2) Complex expert selection creates unpredictable workflows that reduce transparency and increase maintenance costs, making them impractical for time-sensitive business applications. To address these business limitations, we introduce ORMind, a cognitive-inspired framework that enhances optimization through counterfactual reasoning. Our approach emulates human cognition, implementing an end-to-end workflow that systematically transforms requirements into mathematical models and executable solver code. It is currently being tested internally in Lenovo's AI Assistant, with plans to enhance optimization capabilities for both business and consumer customers. Experiments demonstrate that ORMind outperforms existing methods, achieving a 9.5\% improvement on the NL4Opt dataset and a 14.6\% improvement on the ComplexOR dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Theory-of-Mind (ToM) enables humans to infer mental states-such as beliefs, desires, and intentions-forming the foundation of social cognition. However, existing computational ToM methods rely on structured workflows with ToM-specific priors or deep model fine-tuning, which struggle with scalability in multimodal environments and fail to generalize as task complexity increases. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian ToM planner that decomposes ToM reasoning into stepwise Bayesian updates. Our framework introduces weak-to-strong control, allowing smaller language models (LMs) to specialize in ToM-specific likelihood estimation and transfer their reasoning behaviors to larger LMs (7B to 405B) for integration with social and world knowledge. This synergistic approach aligns large-model inference of human mental states with Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 4.6% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art techniques on multimodal ToM benchmarks, including challenging unseen scenarios, thereby establishing a new standard for modeling human mental states in complex environments.

  Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning abilities, prompting the exploration of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) to extend the promise to decision domains. Due to involving more complex dynamics and temporal correlations, existing ICRL approaches may face challenges in learning from suboptimal trajectories and achieving precise in-context inference. In the paper, we propose \textbf{S}calable \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{Q}-\textbf{L}earning (\textbf{SICQL}), an innovative framework that harnesses dynamic programming and world modeling to steer ICRL toward efficient reward maximization and task generalization, while retaining the scalability and stability of supervised pretraining. We design a prompt-based multi-head transformer architecture that simultaneously predicts optimal policies and in-context value functions using separate heads. We pretrain a generalized world model to capture task-relevant information, enabling the construction of a compact prompt that facilitates fast and precise in-context inference. During training, we perform iterative policy improvement by fitting a state value function to an upper-expectile of the Q-function, and distill the in-context value functions into policy extraction using advantage-weighted regression. Extensive experiments across a range of discrete and continuous environments show consistent performance gains over various types of baselines, especially when learning from suboptimal data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Representation learning of geospatial locations remains a core challenge in achieving general geospatial intelligence. Current embedding methods often lack versatility, limiting their utility across diverse tasks in both human and natural domains. We present MobCLIP, the first nationwide general-purpose location encoder, integrating an unprecedented diversity of data modalities through effective and scalable multimodal fusion. Adopting a novel CLIP-based architecture, our framework aligns 100M+ POIs, nationwide remote sensing imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility graph. By tokenizing spatial locations into grid cells inspired by Vision Transformers, we establish a unified representation space bridging mobility patterns and multimodal features. To rigorously evaluate the general-purpose effectiveness of MobCLIP, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 11 downstream prediction tasks across social, economic, and natural domains. Experiments show that MobCLIP, with four input modalities and a compact 128-dimensional representation space, achieves significantly superior general-purpose predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an average of 35%. Thanks to the effective integration of human-centric modalities, the performance gain is particularly profound in human-centric tasks, such as energy consumption (+260%), offline retail consumption amount (+98%), and crime cases (+95%) predictions. Echoing LLM scaling laws, we further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning. We open-source code and pretrained models at:this http URL.

- **[On the Hardness of Approximating Distributions with Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01281)**  `arXiv:2506.01281`  
  _John Leland, YooJung Choi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A fundamental challenge in probabilistic modeling is balancing expressivity and tractable inference. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) aim to directly address this tradeoff by imposing structural constraints that guarantee efficient inference of certain queries while maintaining expressivity. Since inference complexity on PCs depends on circuit size, understanding the size bounds across circuit families is key to characterizing the tradeoff between tractability and expressive efficiency. However, expressive efficiency is often studied through exact representations, where exactly encoding distributions while enforcing various structural properties often incurs exponential size blow-ups. Thus, we pose the following question: can we avoid such size blow-ups by allowing some small approximation error? We first show that approximating an arbitrary distribution with bounded $f$-divergence is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for any model that can tractably compute marginals. We then prove an exponential size gap for approximation between the class of decomposable PCs and additionally deterministic PCs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately determining the geographic location where a single image was taken, visual geolocation, remains a formidable challenge due to the planet's vastness and the deceptive similarity among distant locations. We introduce GeoLocSFT, a framework that demonstrates how targeted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a large multimodal foundation model (Gemma 3) using a small, high-quality dataset can yield highly competitive geolocation performance. GeoLocSFT is trained with only 2700 carefully selected image-GPS pairs from our geographically diverse MR600k dataset. Despite this limited data, our SFT-centric approach substantially improves over baseline models and achieves robust results on standard benchmarks such as Im2GPS-3k and YFCC-4k, as well as on our newly proposed and challenging MR40k benchmark, aimed specifically at sparsely populated regions. Further, we explore multi-candidate inference and aggregation strategies but find that the core gains are already realized at the SFT stage. Our findings highlight the power of high-quality supervision and efficient SFT for planet-scale image geolocation, especially when compared to prior methods that require massive databases or complex pipelines. To foster further research, we publicly release the MR40k benchmark dataset.

  _Artemis Panagopoulou, Le Xue, Honglu Zhou, silvio savarese, Ran Xu, Caiming Xiong, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world decision-making often begins with identifying which modality contains the most relevant information for a given query. While recent multimodal models have made impressive progress in processing diverse inputs, it remains unclear whether they can reason contrastively across multiple modalities to select the one that best satisfies a natural language prompt. We argue this capability is foundational, especially in retrieval-augmented and decision-time contexts, where systems must evaluate multiple signals and identify which one conveys the relevant information. To evaluate this skill, we introduce Contra4, a dataset for contrastive cross-modal reasoning across four modalities: image, audio, video, and 3D. Each example presents a natural language question alongside multiple candidate modality instances, and the model must select the one that semantically aligns with the prompt. Contra4 combines human-annotated captions with a mixture-of-models round-trip-consistency filter to ensure high-quality supervision, resulting in 174k training examples and a manually verified test set of 2.3k samples. While task-specific fine-tuning improves performance by 56% relative to baseline, state-of-the-art models still achieve only 56% accuracy overall and 42% in four-modality settings, underscoring a significant limitation in current multimodal models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have propelled research in natural language interfaces to databases. However, most state-of-the-art text-to- SQL systems still depend on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This work proposes a novel agentic framework that unifies schema linking, query generation, and itera- tive refinement within a single, end-to-end component. By leveraging the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs, our method emulates how humans answer questions when working with unfamiliar databases: understanding the data by formulating hypotheses, running dynamic queries to validate them, reasoning over the results, and revising outputs based on observed results. Crucially, our approach intro- duces a new strategy for scaling test-time computation in text-to-SQL: we scale the depth of interactive database exploration and reflection. This shift enables the model to allocate computation dynamically to better understand the data, especially useful in ambiguous and underspecified scenarios. Our experiments show that it improved the Execution Accuracy (EX) from 44.8% to 56.5% on the challenging BIRD dataset using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Fur- thermore, when equipped with steps to add more diversity to the answers, our agent achieves a Best-of-N accuracy of 81.8% with 8 rounds of candidate gener- ation, rivaling the 82.79% achieved by the top-ranked published solution, while reducing engineering complexity. These findings position our unified framework as a promising alternative for building natural language interfaces to databases.

  CleanS2S is a framework for human-like speech-to-speech interaction that advances conversational AI through single-file implementation and proactive dialogue capabilities. Our system integrates automatic speech recognition, large language models, and text-to-speech synthesis into a unified pipeline with real-time interruption handling, achieving low transition latency through full-duplex websocket connections and non-blocking I/O. Beyond conventional chatbot paradigms, we pioneer a proactive interaction mechanism, which combines memory systems with Subjective Action Judgement module, enabling five human-like response strategies: interruption, refusal, deflection, silence, and standard response. The memory module dynamically aggregates historical, and contextual data to inform interaction decisions. This approach breaks the rigid turn-based convention by allowing system-initiated dialog control and context-aware response selection. And we propose Action Judgement SFT that assesses input streams for responses strategies. The framework's single-file implementation with atomic configurations offers researchers unprecedented transparency and extensibility for interaction agents.

  Autonomous vehicle (AV) planners must undergo rigorous evaluation before widespread deployment on public roads, particularly to assess their robustness against the uncertainty of human behaviors. While recent advancements in data-driven scenario generation enable the simulation of realistic human behaviors in interactive settings, leveraging these models to construct comprehensive tests for AV planners remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce an automated method to efficiently generate realistic and safety-critical human behaviors for AV planner evaluation in interactive scenarios. We parameterize complex human behaviors using low-dimensional goal positions, which are then fed into a promptable traffic simulator, ProSim, to guide the behaviors of simulated agents. To automate test generation, we introduce a prompt generation module that explores the goal domain and efficiently identifies safety-critical behaviors using Bayesian optimization. We apply our method to the evaluation of an optimization-based planner and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in automatically generating diverse and realistic driving behaviors across scenarios with varying initial conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structured scene representations are a core component of embodied agents, helping to consolidate raw sensory streams into readable, modular, and searchable formats. Due to their high computational overhead, many approaches build such representations in advance of the task. However, when the task specifications change, such static approaches become inadequate as they may miss key objects, spatial relations, and details. We introduce GraphPad, a modifiable structured memory that an agent can tailor to the needs of the task through API calls. It comprises a mutable scene graph representing the environment, a navigation log indexing frame-by-frame content, and a scratchpad for task-specific notes. Together, GraphPad serves as a dynamic workspace that remains complete, current, and aligned with the agent's immediate understanding of the scene and its task. On the OpenEQA benchmark, GraphPad attains 55.3%, a +3.0% increase over an image-only baseline using the same vision-language model, while operating with five times fewer input frames. These results show that allowing online, language-driven refinement of 3-D memory yields more informative representations without extra training or data collection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models are increasingly used for complex reasoning tasks where high-quality offline data such as expert-annotated solutions and distilled reasoning traces are often available. However, in environments with sparse rewards, reinforcement learning struggles to sample successful trajectories, leading to inefficient learning. At the same time, these offline trajectories that represent correct reasoning paths are not utilized by standard on-policy reinforcement learning methods. To address this limitation, we propose SuperRL, a unified training framework that adaptively incorporates offline supervision into reinforcement learning. SuperRL introduces an Adaptive Switch to detect sparse reward conditions and activates a Hybrid Actor when necessary. The Hybrid Actor integrates policy gradient and supervised learning objectives at the loss level, enabling the model to benefit from accurate offline reasoning signals while maintaining the exploratory capacity of reinforcement learning. Experiments on a range of reasoning benchmarks show that SuperRL consistently outperforms standard reinforcement learning by improving sample efficiency, generalization, and robustness under sparse rewards.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sustaining coherent, role-aware communication across multi-agent systems remains a foundational challenge in AI. Current frameworks often lack explicit mechanisms for speaker responsibility, leading to context drift, alignment instability, and degraded interpretability over time. We propose the Modular Speaker Architecture (MSA), a framework that decomposes speaker behavior into modular components for role tracking, responsibility continuity, and contextual coherence. Grounded in high-context human-AI dialogues, MSA includes three core modules: a Speaker Role Module, a Responsibility Chain Tracker, and a Contextual Integrity Validator. We evaluate MSA through annotated case studies and introduce structural metrics-pragmatic consistency, responsibility flow, and context stability-quantified via manual and automatic scoring and bootstrapped statistical analysis. Our results show that MSA reliably maintains interaction structure without reliance on affective signals or surface-level heuristics. We further implement a prototype configuration language (G-Code) and modular API to support MSA deployment in dynamic multi-agent scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, selecting the optimal LLM to respond to a user query often necessitates a delicate balance between performance and cost. While powerful models deliver better results, they come at a high cost, whereas smaller models are more cost-effective but less capable. To address this trade-off, we propose IRT-Router, a multi-LLM routing framework that efficiently routes user queries to the most suitable LLM. Inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), a psychological measurement methodology, IRT-Router explicitly models the relationship between LLM capabilities and user query attributes. This not only enables accurate prediction of response performance but also provides interpretable insights, such as LLM abilities and query difficulty. Additionally, we design an online query warm-up technique based on semantic similarity, further enhancing the online generalization capability of IRT-Router. Extensive experiments on 20 LLMs and 12 datasets demonstrate that IRT-Router outperforms most baseline methods in terms of effectiveness and interpretability. Its superior performance in cold-start scenarios further confirms the reliability and practicality of IRT-Router in real-world applications. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting social media bots is essential for maintaining the security and trustworthiness of social networks. While contemporary graph-based detection methods demonstrate promising results, their practical application is limited by label reliance and poor generalization capability across diverse communities. Generative Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSL) presents a promising paradigm to overcome these limitations, yet existing approaches predominantly follow the homophily assumption and fail to capture the global patterns in the graph, which potentially diminishes their effectiveness when facing the challenges of interaction camouflage and distributed deployment in bot detection scenarios. To this end, we propose BotHP, a generative GSL framework tailored to boost graph-based bot detectors through heterophily-aware representation learning and prototype-guided cluster discovery. Specifically, BotHP leverages a dual-encoder architecture, consisting of a graph-aware encoder to capture node commonality and a graph-agnostic encoder to preserve node uniqueness. This enables the simultaneous modeling of both homophily and heterophily, effectively countering the interaction camouflage issue. Additionally, BotHP incorporates a prototype-guided cluster discovery pretext task to model the latent global consistency of bot clusters and identify spatially dispersed yet semantically aligned bot collectives. Extensive experiments on two real-world bot detection benchmarks demonstrate that BotHP consistently boosts graph-based bot detectors, improving detection performance, alleviating label reliance, and enhancing generalization capability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mainstream Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) approaches have employed BERT to extract semantics from both context and definitions of senses to determine the most suitable sense of a target word, achieving notable performance. However, there are two limitations in these approaches. First, previous studies failed to balance the representation of token-level (local) and sequence-level (global) semantics during feature extraction, leading to insufficient semantic representation and a performance bottleneck. Second, these approaches incorporated all possible senses of each target word during the training phase, leading to unnecessary computational costs. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a poly-encoder BERT-based model with batch contrastive learning for WSD, named PolyBERT. Compared with previous WSD methods, PolyBERT has two improvements: (1) A poly-encoder with a multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to fuse token-level (local) and sequence-level (global) semantics, rather than focusing on just one. This approach enriches semantic representation by balancing local and global semantics. (2) To avoid redundant training inputs, Batch Contrastive Learning (BCL) is introduced. BCL utilizes the correct senses of other target words in the same batch as negative samples for the current target word, which reduces training inputs and computational cost. The experimental results demonstrate that PolyBERT outperforms baseline WSD methods such as Huang's GlossBERT and Blevins's BEM by 2\% in F1-score. In addition, PolyBERT with BCL reduces GPU hours by 37.6\% compared with PolyBERT without BCL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a prominent strategy for scaling large language models (LLMs), effectively leveraging sparse activation and facilitating task-specific personalization. However, current federated learning (FL) approaches are primarily designed for dense models, making them unable to directly exploit the sparsity inherent in MoE architectures. Treating MoE models as dense networks in federated scenarios results in excessive communication overhead and computational costs, undermining the potential for personalized knowledge sharing. To address these challenges, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel federated learning framework explicitly tailored for MoE-based LLMs. FLEx efficiently personalizes by pruning the global MoE model to keep only one expert per client, and employs an adaptive gating mechanism to reintegrate these personalized experts into the pre-trained MoE layers, ensuring the original backbone architecture remains unchanged. These personalized experts are trained with local data and stored locally on each client, while the shared modules are aggregated globally. Extensive evaluations on diverse instruction-based datasets under non-IID conditions consistently demonstrate that FLEx outperforms existing federated baselines.

  Nonverbal communication is integral to human interaction, with gestures, facial expressions, and body language conveying critical aspects of intent and emotion. However, existing large language models (LLMs) fail to effectively incorporate these nonverbal elements, limiting their capacity to create fully immersive conversational experiences. We introduce MARS, a multimodal language model designed to understand and generate nonverbal cues alongside text, bridging this gap in conversational AI. Our key innovation is VENUS, a large-scale dataset comprising annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial expressions, and body language. Leveraging VENUS, we train MARS with a next-token prediction objective, combining text with vector-quantized nonverbal representations to achieve multimodal understanding and generation within a unified framework. Based on various analyses of the VENUS datasets, we validate its substantial scale and high effectiveness. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that MARS successfully generates text and nonverbal languages, corresponding to conversational input.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) aligned with general human objectives, such as being harmless and hallucination-free, have become valuable assistants of humans in managing visual tasks. However, people with diversified backgrounds have different cognition even in the same situation. Consequently, they may have personalized expectations for VLM assistants. This highlights the urgent need to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition for real-world assistance. To study this problem, we first simplify it by characterizing individuals based on the sociological concept of Role-Set. Then, we propose to evaluate the individuals' actions to examine whether the personalized alignment is achieved. Further, we construct a benchmark named PCogAlignBench, which includes 18k instances and 20 individuals with different Role-Sets. Finally, we present a framework called PCogAlign, which constructs a cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate the reliability of the PCogAlignBench and the effectiveness of our proposed PCogAlign. We will open-source the constructed benchmark and code atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern language model deployments must often balance competing objectives, for example, helpfulness versus harmlessness, cost versus accuracy, and reward versus safety. We introduce Conformal Arbitrage, a post hoc framework that learns a data driven threshold to mediate between a Primary model optimized for a primary objective and a more conservative Guardian which could be another model or a human domain expert aligned with a guardrail objective. The threshold is calibrated with conformal risk control, yielding finite sample, distribution free guarantees that the long run frequency of undesirable events, such as factual errors or safety violations, does not exceed a user specified quota. Because Conformal Arbitrage operates wholly at the API level, without requiring access to model logits or updating model weights, it complements weight based alignment techniques and integrates seamlessly with existing cost aware cascades. Empirically, Conformal Arbitrage traces an efficient frontier, allowing users to define an acceptable performance level for one objective while maximizing utility in another. We observe that our method outperforms, in terms of accuracy, cost matched random routing between models. These properties make Conformal Arbitrage a practical, theoretically grounded tool for trustworthy and economical deployment of large language models across a broad range of potentially competing objectives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into increasingly autonomous agents, fundamental questions about their epistemic foundations remain unresolved: What defines an agent? How should it make decisions? And what objectives should guide its behavior? In this position paper, we argue that true autonomy requires agents to be grounded in a coherent epistemic framework that governs what they know, what they need to know, and how to acquire that knowledge efficiently. We propose a unified theory that treats internal reasoning and external actions as equivalent epistemic tools, enabling agents to systematically coordinate introspection and interaction. Building on this framework, we advocate for aligning an agent's tool use decision-making boundary with its knowledge boundary, thereby minimizing unnecessary tool use and maximizing epistemic efficiency. This perspective shifts the design of agents from mere action executors to knowledge-driven intelligence systems, offering a principled path toward building foundation agents capable of adaptive, efficient, and goal-directed behavior.

  Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) extracts emotions from multimodal data, including visual, speech, and text inputs, playing a key role in human-computer interaction. Attention-based fusion methods dominate MER research, achieving strong classification performance. However, two key challenges remain: effectively extracting modality-specific features and capturing cross-modal similarities despite distribution differences caused by modality heterogeneity. To address these, we propose a gated interactive attention mechanism to adaptively extract modality-specific features while enhancing emotional information through pairwise interactions. Additionally, we introduce a modality-invariant generator to learn modality-invariant representations and constrain domain shifts by aligning cross-modal similarities. Experiments on IEMOCAP demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MER approaches, achieving WA 80.7% and UA 81.3%.

Meanwhile, as an invaluable knowledge source, the potential of medical textbooks for benchmark development remains underexploited. Here, we present MedBookVQA, a systematic and comprehensive multimodal benchmark derived from open-access medical textbooks. To curate this benchmark, we propose a standardized pipeline for automated extraction of medical figures while contextually aligning them with corresponding medical narratives. Based on this curated data, we generate 5,000 clinically relevant questions spanning modality recognition, disease classification, anatomical identification, symptom diagnosis, and surgical procedures. A multi-tier annotation system categorizes queries through hierarchical taxonomies encompassing medical imaging modalities (42 categories), body anatomies (125 structures), and clinical specialties (31 departments), enabling nuanced analysis across medical subdomains. We evaluate a wide array of MLLMs, including proprietary, open-sourced, medical, and reasoning models, revealing significant performance disparities across task types and model categories. Our findings highlight critical capability gaps in current GMAI systems while establishing textbook-derived multimodal benchmarks as essential evaluation tools. MedBookVQA establishes textbook-derived benchmarking as a critical paradigm for advancing clinical AI, exposing limitations in GMAI systems while providing anatomically structured performance metrics across specialties.

  Fine-grained video captioning aims to generate detailed, temporally coherent descriptions of video content. However, existing methods struggle to capture subtle video dynamics and rich detailed information. In this paper, we leverage preference learning to enhance the performance of vision-language models in fine-grained video captioning, while mitigating several limitations inherent to direct preference optimization (DPO). First, we propose a pipeline for constructing preference pairs that leverages the intrinsic properties of VLMs along with partial assistance from large language models, achieving an optimal balance between cost and data quality. Second, we propose Synergistic Preference Optimization (SynPO), a novel optimization method offering significant advantages over DPO and its variants. SynPO prevents negative preferences from dominating the optimization, explicitly preserves the model's language capability to avoid deviation of the optimization objective, and improves training efficiency by eliminating the need for the reference model. We extensively evaluate SynPO not only on video captioning benchmarks (e.g., VDC, VDD, VATEX) but also across well-established NLP tasks, including general language understanding and preference evaluation, using diverse pretrained models. Results demonstrate that SynPO consistently outperforms DPO variants while achieving 20\% improvement in training efficiency. Code is available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced their performance by enabling in-depth understanding of diverse tasks. With growing interest in applying LLMs to the time series domain, this has proven nontrivial, as evidenced by the limited efficacy of straightforwardly adapting text-domain reasoning techniques. Although recent work has shown promise in several time series tasks, further leveraging advancements in LLM reasoning remains under-explored for time series classification (TSC) tasks, despite their prevalence and significance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ReasonTSC, a novel framework designed to effectively leverage LLM reasoning for time series classification through both a multi-turn reasoning and a fused decision-making strategy tailored to TSC. Rather than straightforwardly applying existing reasoning techniques or relying solely on LLMs' built-in reasoning capabilities, ReasonTSC first steers the model to think over the essential characteristics of time series data. Next, it integrates predictions and confidence scores from plug-in classifiers, e.g., domain-specific time series models, as in-context examples. Finally, ReasonTSC guides the LLM through a structured reasoning process: it evaluates the initial assessment, backtracks to consider alternative hypotheses, and compares their merits before arriving at a final classification. Extensive experiments and systematic ablation studies demonstrate that ReasonTSC consistently outperforms both existing time series reasoning baselines and plug-in models, and is even capable of identifying and correcting plug-in models' false predictions.

  Many promising-looking ideas in AI research fail to deliver, but their validation takes substantial human labor and compute. Predicting an idea's chance of success is thus crucial for accelerating empirical AI research, a skill that even expert researchers can only acquire through substantial experience. We build the first benchmark for this task and compare LMs with human experts. Concretely, given two research ideas (e.g., two jailbreaking methods), we aim to predict which will perform better on a set of benchmarks. We scrape ideas and experimental results from conference papers, yielding 1,585 human-verified idea pairs published after our base model's cut-off date for testing, and 6,000 pairs for training. We then develop a system that combines a fine-tuned GPT-4.1 with a paper retrieval agent, and we recruit 25 human experts to compare with. In the NLP domain, our system beats human experts by a large margin (64.4% v.s. 48.9%). On the full test set, our system achieves 77% accuracy, while off-the-shelf frontier LMs like o3 perform no better than random guessing, even with the same retrieval augmentation. We verify that our system does not exploit superficial features like idea complexity through extensive human-written and LM-designed robustness tests. Finally, we evaluate our system on unpublished novel ideas, including ideas generated by an AI ideation agent. Our system achieves 63.6% accuracy, demonstrating its potential as a reward model for improving idea generation models. Altogether, our results outline a promising new direction for LMs to accelerate empirical AI research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

  As large language models (LLMs) grow in power and influence, ensuring their safety and preventing harmful output becomes critical. Automated red teaming serves as a tool to detect security vulnerabilities in LLMs without manual labor. However, most existing methods struggle to balance the effectiveness and diversity of red-team generated attack prompts. To address this challenge, we propose \ourapproach, a novel automated red teaming training framework that utilizes reinforcement learning to explore and generate more effective attack prompts while balancing their diversity. Specifically, it consists of three training stages: (1) Cold Start: The red team model is supervised and fine-tuned on a jailbreak dataset obtained through imitation learning. (2) Warm-up Exploration: The model is trained in jailbreak instruction following and exploration, using diversity and consistency as reward signals. (3) Enhanced Jailbreak: Progressive jailbreak rewards are introduced to gradually enhance the jailbreak performance of the red-team model. Extensive experiments on a variety of LLMs show that \ourapproach effectively balances the diversity and effectiveness of jailbreak prompts compared to existing methods. Our work significantly improves the efficiency of red team exploration and provides a new perspective on automated red teaming.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred transformative applications in various domains, ranging from open-source to proprietary LLMs. However, jailbreak attacks, which aim to break safety alignment and user compliance by tricking the target LLMs into answering harmful and risky responses, are becoming an urgent concern. The practice of red-teaming for LLMs is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of red-teaming principles as instructions to an AI agent to automatically orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts. Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, they frequently exhibit overconfidence when encountering uncertain scenarios, yet existing solutions primarily rely on evasive responses (e.g., "I don't know") overlooks the opportunity of identifying and addressing the uncertainty to generate more satisfactory responses. To systematically investigate and improve LLMs' ability of recognizing and addressing the source of uncertainty, we introduce \textbf{ConfuseBench}, a benchmark mainly focus on three types of uncertainty: document scarcity, limited capability, and query ambiguity. Experiments with ConfuseBench reveal that current LLMs struggle to accurately identify the root cause of uncertainty and solve it. They prefer to attribute uncertainty to query ambiguity while overlooking capability limitations, especially for those weaker models. To tackle this challenge, we first generate context-aware inquiries that highlight the confusing aspect of the original query. Then we judge the source of uncertainty based on the uniqueness of the inquiry's answer. Further we use an on-policy training method, InteractDPO to generate better inquiries. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

  Accurate house-price forecasting is essential for investors, planners, and researchers. However, reproducible benchmarks with sufficient spatiotemporal depth and contextual richness for long horizon prediction remain scarce. To address this, we introduce HouseTS a large scale, multimodal dataset covering monthly house prices from March 2012 to December 2023 across 6,000 ZIP codes in 30 major U.S. metropolitan areas. The dataset includes over 890K records, enriched with points of Interest (POI), socioeconomic indicators, and detailed real estate metrics. To establish standardized performance baselines, we evaluate 14 models, spanning classical statistical approaches, deep neural networks (DNNs), and pretrained time-series foundation models. We further demonstrate the value of HouseTS in a multimodal case study, where a vision language model extracts structured textual descriptions of geographic change from time stamped satellite imagery. This enables interpretable, grounded insights into urban evolution. HouseTS is hosted on Kaggle, while all preprocessing pipelines, benchmark code, and documentation are openly maintained on GitHub to ensure full reproducibility and easy adoption.

  _Zhuojun Gu, Quan Wang, Shuchu Han_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need to align their behaviors with human values. A critical, yet understudied, issue is the potential divergence between an LLM's stated preferences (its reported alignment with general principles) and its revealed preferences (inferred from decisions in contextualized scenarios). Such deviations raise fundamental concerns for the interpretability, trustworthiness, reasoning transparency, and ethical deployment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications. This work formally defines and proposes a method to measure this preference deviation. We investigate how LLMs may activate different guiding principles in specific contexts, leading to choices that diverge from previously stated general principles. Our approach involves crafting a rich dataset of well-designed prompts as a series of forced binary choices and presenting them to LLMs. We compare LLM responses to general principle prompts stated preference with LLM responses to contextualized prompts revealed preference, using metrics like KL divergence to quantify the deviation. We repeat the analysis across different categories of preferences and on four mainstream LLMs and find that a minor change in prompt format can often pivot the preferred choice regardless of the preference categories and LLMs in the test. This prevalent phenomenon highlights the lack of understanding and control of the LLM decision-making competence. Our study will be crucial for integrating LLMs into services, especially those that interact directly with humans, where morality, fairness, and social responsibilities are crucial dimensions. Furthermore, identifying or being aware of such deviation will be critically important as LLMs are increasingly envisioned for autonomous agentic tasks where continuous human evaluation of all LLMs' intermediary decision-making steps is impossible.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ontologies are pivotal for structuring knowledge bases to enhance question answering (QA) systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, traditional ontology creation relies on manual efforts by domain experts, a process that is time intensive, error prone, and impractical for large, dynamic knowledge domains. This paper introduces OntoRAG, an automated pipeline designed to derive ontologies from unstructured knowledge bases, with a focus on electrical relay documents. OntoRAG integrates advanced techniques, including web scraping, PDF parsing, hybrid chunking, information extraction, knowledge graph construction, and ontology creation, to transform unstructured data into a queryable ontology. By leveraging LLMs and graph based methods, OntoRAG enhances global sensemaking capabilities, outperforming conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG approaches in comprehensiveness and diversity. Experimental results demonstrate OntoRAGs effectiveness, achieving a comprehensiveness win rate of 85% against vector RAG and 75% against GraphRAGs best configuration. This work addresses the critical challenge of automating ontology creation, advancing the vision of the semantic web.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce \sys, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. \sys constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed \data, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. \data comprises \textbf{2293} meticulously annotated interaction records, covering \textbf{15} risk types across \textbf{29} application scenarios. A key feature of \data is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing ``Strict'' and ``Lenient'' judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that \sys not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy. Our work is openly openly accessible.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they are increasingly deployed as autonomous computer-use agents capable of accomplishing complex computer tasks. However, a pressing issue arises: Can the safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios? Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing trustworthy computer-use agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Psychology research has shown that humans are poor at estimating their performance on tasks, tending towards underconfidence on easy tasks and overconfidence on difficult tasks. We examine three LLMs, Llama-3-70B-instruct, Claude-3-Sonnet, and GPT-4o, on a range of QA tasks of varying difficulty, and show that models exhibit subtle differences from human patterns of overconfidence: less sensitive to task difficulty, and when prompted to answer based on different personas -- e.g., expert vs layman, or different race, gender, and ages -- the models will respond with stereotypically biased confidence estimations even though their underlying answer accuracy remains the same. Based on these observations, we propose Answer-Free Confidence Estimation (AFCE) to improve confidence calibration and LLM interpretability in these settings. AFCE is a self-assessment method that employs two stages of prompting, first eliciting only confidence scores on questions, then asking separately for the answer. Experiments on the MMLU and GPQA datasets spanning subjects and difficulty show that this separation of tasks significantly reduces overconfidence and delivers more human-like sensitivity to task difficulty.

  With the rapid penetration of artificial intelligence across industries and scenarios, a key challenge in building the next-generation intelligent core lies in effectively integrating the language understanding capabilities of foundation models with domain-specific knowledge bases in complex real-world applications. This paper proposes a multimodal cognition and embodied decision-making brain system, ``Wenlu", designed to enable secure fusion of private knowledge and public models, unified processing of multimodal data such as images and speech, and closed-loop decision-making from cognition to automatic generation of hardware-level code.

In this work, we introduce $\textbf{CityLens}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language-vision models (LLVMs) in predicting socioeconomic indicators from satellite and street view imagery. We construct a multi-modal dataset covering a total of 17 globally distributed cities, spanning 6 key domains: economy, education, crime, transport, health, and environment, reflecting the multifaceted nature of urban life. Based on this dataset, we define 11 prediction tasks and utilize three evaluation paradigms: Direct Metric Prediction, Normalized Metric Estimation, and Feature-Based Regression. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art LLVMs across these tasks. Our results reveal that while LLVMs demonstrate promising perceptual and reasoning capabilities, they still exhibit limitations in predicting urban socioeconomic indicators.

  Input-output robustness appears in various different forms in the literature, such as robustness of AI models to adversarial or semantic perturbations and individual fairness of AI models that make decisions about humans.We propose runtime monitoring of input-output robustness of deployed, black-box AI models, where the goal is to design monitors that would observe one long execution sequence of the model, and would raise an alarm whenever it is detected that two similar inputs from the past led to dissimilar outputs.This way, monitoring will complement existing offline ``robustification'' approaches to increase the trustworthiness of AI decision-makers.We show that the monitoring problem can be cast as the fixed-radius nearest neighbor (FRNN) search problem, which, despite being well-studied, lacks suitable online solutions.We present our tool Clemont, which offers a number of lightweight monitors, some of which use upgraded online variants of existing FRNN algorithms, and one uses a novel algorithm based on binary decision diagrams -- a data-structure commonly used in software and hardware verification.We have also developed an efficient parallelization technique that can substantially cut down the computation time of monitors for which the distance between input-output pairs is measured using the $L_\infty$ norm.Using standard benchmarks from the literature of adversarial and semantic robustness and individual fairness, we perform a comparative study of different monitors in \tool, and demonstrate their effectiveness in correctly detecting robustness violations at runtime.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human intelligence relies on inner monologue to process complex information through simultaneous reflection, memory retrieval, and response formulation. We introduce MIRROR (Modular Internal Reasoning, Reflection, Orchestration, and Response), a cognitive architecture that systematically implements these parallel reasoning capabilities in large language models. MIRROR operates as a unified system with two distinct functional layers: the Thinker and the Talker. The Thinker encompasses: (1) the Inner Monologue Manager, coordinating reasoning threads across cognitive dimensions (Goals, Reasoning, and Memory); and (2) the Cognitive Controller, synthesizing these threads into a coherent internal narrative maintained across conversation turns. The Talker component then leverages this integrated narrative for context-aware responses. Evaluated on the CuRaTe benchmark--testing personalized dialogue with safety-critical constraints, conflicting preferences, and multi-turn consistency--LLMs utilizing the MIRROR architecture achieve up to 156% relative improvement in critical safety scenarios involving three persons with conflicting preferences, maintaining an average accuracy of ~>80% on all scenarios. Across scenario-specific comparisons, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Llama 4 variants, and Mistral 3 variants with the MIRROR architecture outperformed baseline models by 21% on average (15.5 percentage points absolute). MIRROR directly addresses three critical LLM failure modes: sycophancy, attentional deficits to critical information, and inconsistent prioritization of conflicting constraints. This work bridges cognitive science and AI by implementing modular internal reasoning inspired by human cognition, creating a persistent internal model that significantly enhances multi-turn conversation capabilities.

  World models are emerging as a transformative paradigm in artificial intelligence, enabling agents to construct internal representations of their environments for predictive reasoning, planning, and decision-making. By learning latent dynamics, world models provide a sample-efficient framework that is especially valuable in data-constrained or safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of world models, highlighting their architecture, training paradigms, and applications across prediction, generation, planning, and causal reasoning. We compare and distinguish world models from related concepts such as digital twins, the metaverse, and foundation models, clarifying their unique role as embedded cognitive engines for autonomous agents. We further propose Wireless Dreamer, a novel world model-based reinforcement learning framework tailored for wireless edge intelligence optimization, particularly in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs). Through a weather-aware UAV trajectory planning case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving learning efficiency and decision quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite extraordinary progress in artificial intelligence (AI), modern systems remain incomplete representations of human cognition. Vision, audition, and language have received disproportionate attention due to well-defined benchmarks, standardized datasets, and consensus-driven scientific foundations. In contrast, olfaction - a high-bandwidth, evolutionarily critical sense - has been largely overlooked. This omission presents a foundational gap in the construction of truly embodied and ethically aligned super-human intelligence. We argue that the exclusion of olfactory perception from AI architectures is not due to irrelevance but to structural challenges: unresolved scientific theories of smell, heterogeneous sensor technologies, lack of standardized olfactory datasets, absence of AI-oriented benchmarks, and difficulty in evaluating sub-perceptual signal processing. These obstacles have hindered the development of machine olfaction despite its tight coupling with memory, emotion, and contextual reasoning in biological systems. In this position paper, we assert that meaningful progress toward general and embodied intelligence requires serious investment in olfactory research by the AI community. We call for cross-disciplinary collaboration - spanning neuroscience, robotics, machine learning, and ethics - to formalize olfactory benchmarks, develop multimodal datasets, and define the sensory capabilities necessary for machines to understand, navigate, and act within human environments. Recognizing olfaction as a core modality is essential not only for scientific completeness, but for building AI systems that are ethically grounded in the full scope of the human experience.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The quest for interpretable reinforcement learning is a grand challenge for the deployment of autonomous decision-making systems in safety-critical applications. Modern deep reinforcement learning approaches, while powerful, tend to produce opaque policies that compromise verification, reduce transparency, and impede human oversight. To address this, we introduce BASIL (Best-Action Symbolic Interpretable Learning), a systematic approach for generating symbolic, rule-based policies via online evolutionary search with quality-diversity (QD) optimization. BASIL represents policies as ordered lists of symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring full interpretability and tractable policy complexity. By using a QD archive, the methodology in the proposed study encourages behavioral and structural diversity between top-performing solutions, while a complexity-aware fitness encourages the synthesis of compact representations. The evolutionary system supports the use of exact constraints for rule count and system adaptability for balancing transparency with expressiveness. Empirical comparisons with three benchmark tasks CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, and Acrobot-v1 show that BASIL consistently synthesizes interpretable controllers with compact representations comparable to deep reinforcement learning baselines. Herein, this article introduces a new interpretable policy synthesis method that combines symbolic expressiveness, evolutionary diversity, and online learning through a unifying framework.

  Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification, goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a range of educational tasks, but are still understudied for their potential to solve mathematical problems. In this study, we compare three prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0, on three mathematics datasets of varying complexities (GSM8K, MATH500, and UNSW datasets). We take a five-dimensional approach based on the Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework to assess final answer correctness, step completeness, step validity, intermediate calculation accuracy, and problem comprehension. The results show that GPT-4o is the most stable and consistent in performance across all the datasets, but particularly it performs outstandingly in high-level questions of the UNSW dataset. DeepSeek-V3 is competitively strong in well-structured domains such as optimisation, but suffers from fluctuations in accuracy in statistical inference tasks. Gemini-2.0 shows strong linguistic understanding and clarity in well-structured problems but performs poorly in multi-step reasoning and symbolic logic. Our error analysis reveals particular deficits in each model: GPT-4o is at times lacking in sufficient explanation or precision; DeepSeek-V3 leaves out intermediate steps; and Gemini-2.0 is less flexible in mathematical reasoning in higher dimensions.

  Despite extensive research on the relationship between sleep and cognition, the connection between sleep microstructure and human performance across specific cognitive domains remains underexplored. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict executive functions, particularly cognitive adaptability and conceptual reasoning from physiological processes during a night's sleep. To address this, we introduce CogPSGFormer, a multi-scale convolutional-transformer model designed to process multi-modal polysomnographic data. This model integrates one-channel ECG and EEG signals along with extracted features, including EEG power bands and heart rate variability parameters, to capture complementary information across modalities. A thorough evaluation of the CogPSGFormer architecture was conducted to optimize the processing of extended sleep signals and identify the most effective configuration. The proposed framework was evaluated on 817 individuals from the STAGES dataset using cross-validation. The model achieved 80.3\% accuracy in classifying individuals into low vs. high cognitive performance groups on unseen data based on Penn Conditional Exclusion Test (PCET) scores. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our multi-scale feature extraction and multi-modal learning approach in leveraging sleep-derived signals for cognitive performance prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, our code is publicly accessible (this https URL).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in open-ended, real-world environments where inputs are messy, underspecified, and not always trustworthy. Unlike curated benchmarks, these settings frequently involve instructions that refer to missing objects or contradictory facts, rely on ambiguous references, or request infeasible actions. In such cases, success hinges not on task execution alone, but on a model's ability to detect when something is silently wrong. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how current MLLMs handle such implicit reasoning scenarios: cases where the flaw is not explicitly stated but must be inferred from context. Using a curated diagnostic suite spanning four categories of real-world failure modes, we evaluate six MLLMs, including o3 and GPT-4o, and find that models frequently fail to surface hidden issues, even when they possess the necessary perceptual and reasoning skills. Explicit prompting reveals that the underlying capabilities exist but are often suppressed in favor of user compliance. We further show that simple inference-time interventions, such as cautious persona prompting and, in particular, requiring a clarifying question, can dramatically recover performance. Our findings highlight a persistent gap between reasoning competence and behavioral compliance in current MLLMs and suggest practical strategies for making these models more trustworthy in underconstrained environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There has been a surge of interest in harnessing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. While existing approaches rely on grounding the discovery process within the relevant literature, effectiveness varies significantly with the quality and nature of the retrieved literature. We address the challenge of retrieving prior work whose concepts can inspire solutions for a given research problem, a task we define as Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR). We construct a novel dataset tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG); capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage MAG to embed an "intuitive prior" into dense retrievers for identifying patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity. This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average Precision (mAP) over strong baselines. Further, we adapt LLM-based re-ranking strategies to MIR, yielding additional improvements of +4.5 in Recall@3 and +4.8 in mAP. Through extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses, we exhibit the promise of MIR in enhancing automated scientific discovery and outline avenues for advancing inspiration-driven retrieval.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of large language models (LLMs) into global applications necessitates effective cultural alignment for meaningful and culturally-sensitive interactions. Current LLMs often lack the nuanced understanding required for diverse cultural contexts, and adapting them typically involves costly full fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a novel soft prompt fine-tuning framework that enables efficient and modular cultural alignment. Our method utilizes vectorized prompt tuning to dynamically route queries to a committee of culturally specialized 'expert' LLM configurations, created by optimizing soft prompt embeddings without altering the base model's parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances cultural sensitivity and adaptability, improving alignment scores from 0.208 to 0.820, offering a robust solution for culturally-aware LLM deployment. This research paves the way for subsequent investigations into enhanced cultural coverage and dynamic expert adaptation, crucial for realizing autonomous AI with deeply nuanced understanding in a globally interconnected world.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability of AI to sense and identify various substances based on their smell alone can have profound impacts on allergen detection (e.g., smelling gluten or peanuts in a cake), monitoring the manufacturing process, and sensing hormones that indicate emotional states, stress levels, and diseases. Despite these broad impacts, there are virtually no large scale benchmarks, and therefore little progress, for training and evaluating AI systems' ability to smell in the real world. In this paper, we use portable gas and chemical sensors to create SmellNet, the first large-scale database that digitizes a diverse range of smells in the natural world. SmellNet contains about 180,000 time steps of 50 substances (spanning nuts, spices, herbs, fruits, and vegetables) with 50 hours of data. Using SmellNet, we train AI models for real-time classification of substances based on their smell alone. Our best methods leverage sequence models, contrastive learning to integrate high-resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry molecular data, and a new temporal difference method that identifies sharp changes in sensor readings. Our best models achieve up to 65.35% accuracy on pre-recorded data, and generalize to real-world conditions with 10.71% accuracy on nuts and 25.38% on spices in the challenging 50-way online classification task. Despite these promising results, SmellNet highlights many technical challenges in building AI for smell, including richer feature learning, on-edge smell models, and robustness to environmental changes.

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming sectors such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, offering powerful tools for innovation. Yet its rapid integration raises urgent ethical concerns related to data ownership, privacy, and systemic bias. Issues like opaque decision-making, misleading outputs, and unfair treatment in high-stakes domains underscore the need for transparent and accountable AI systems. This article addresses these challenges by proposing a modular ethical assessment framework built on ontological blocks of meaning-discrete, interpretable units that encode ethical principles such as fairness, accountability, and ownership. By integrating these blocks with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, the framework supports scalable, transparent, and legally aligned ethical evaluations, including compliance with the EU AI Act. Using a real-world use case in AI-powered investor profiling, the paper demonstrates how the framework enables dynamic, behavior-informed risk classification. The findings suggest that ontological blocks offer a promising path toward explainable and auditable AI ethics, though challenges remain in automation and probabilistic reasoning.

  Generative AI is showing early evidence of productivity gains for software developers, but concerns persist regarding workforce disruption and deskilling. We describe our research with 21 developers at the cutting edge of using AI, summarizing 12 of their work goals we uncovered, together with 75 associated tasks and the skills & knowledge for each, illustrating how developers use AI at work. From all of these, we distilled our findings in the form of 5 insights. We found that the skills & knowledge to be a successful AI-enhanced developer are organized into four domains (using Generative AI effectively, core software engineering, adjacent engineering, and adjacent non-engineering) deployed at critical junctures throughout a 6-step task workflow. In order to "future proof" developers for this age of AI, on-the-job learning initiatives and computer science degree programs will need to target both "soft" skills and the technical skills & knowledge in all four domains to reskill, upskill and safeguard against deskilling.

  This paper target in addressing the challenges of underthinking and overthinking in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by introducing Reasoning Control Fields (RCF)--a novel test-time approach that injects structured control signals to guide reasoning from a tree search perspective. RCF enables models to adjust reasoning effort according to given control conditions when solving complex tasks. Additionally, we present the Control-R-4K dataset, which consists of challenging problems annotated with detailed reasoning processes and corresponding control fields. To further enhance reasoning control, we propose a Conditional Distillation Finetuning (CDF) method, which trains model--particularly Control-R-32B--to effectively adjust reasoning effort during test time. Experimental results on benchmarks such as AIME2024 and MATH500 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 32B scale while enabling a controllable Long CoT reasoning process (L-CoT). Overall, this work introduces an effective paradigm for controllable test-time scaling reasoning.

  The volume of textual data available in aviation safety reports presents a challenge for timely and accurate analysis. This paper examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can automate the process of extracting valuable insights from this data, ultimately enhancing aviation safety. The paper reviews ongoing efforts focused on the application of NLP and deep learning to aviation safety reports, with the goal of classifying the level of damage to an aircraft and identifying the phase of flight during which safety occurrences happen. Additionally, the paper explores the use of Topic Modeling (TM) to uncover latent thematic structures within aviation incident reports, aiming to identify recurring patterns and potential areas for safety improvement. The paper compares and contrasts the performance of various deep learning models and TM techniques applied to datasets from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), as well as the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), discussing the impact of dataset size and source on the accuracy of the analysis. The findings demonstrate that both NLP and deep learning, as well as TM, can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of aviation safety analysis, paving the way for more proactive safety management and risk mitigation strategies.

  Automating AI research holds immense potential for accelerating scientific progress, yet current AI agents struggle with the complexities of rigorous, end-to-end experimentation. We introduce EXP-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate AI agents on complete research experiments sourced from influential AI publications. Given a research question and incomplete starter code, EXP-Bench challenges AI agents to formulate hypotheses, design and implement experimental procedures, execute them, and analyze results. To enable the creation of such intricate and authentic tasks with high-fidelity, we design a semi-autonomous pipeline to extract and structure crucial experimental details from these research papers and their associated open-source code. With the pipeline, EXP-Bench curated 461 AI research tasks from 51 top-tier AI research papers. Evaluations of leading LLM-based agents, such as OpenHands and IterativeAgent on EXP-Bench demonstrate partial capabilities: while scores on individual experimental aspects such as design or implementation correctness occasionally reach 20-35%, the success rate for complete, executable experiments was a mere 0.5%. By identifying these bottlenecks and providing realistic step-by-step experiment procedures, EXP-Bench serves as a vital tool for future AI agents to improve their ability to conduct AI research experiments.

  Graph-based RAG methods like GraphRAG have shown promising global understanding of the knowledge base by constructing hierarchical entity graphs. However, they often suffer from inefficiency and rely on manually pre-defined query modes, limiting practical use. In this paper, we propose E^2GraphRAG, a streamlined graph-based RAG framework that improves both Efficiency and Effectiveness. During the indexing stage, E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree with large language models and an entity graph with SpaCy based on document chunks. We then construct bidirectional indexes between entities and chunks to capture their many-to-many relationships, enabling fast lookup during both local and global retrieval. For the retrieval stage, we design an adaptive retrieval strategy that leverages the graph structure to retrieve and select between local and global modes. Experiments show that E^2GraphRAG achieves up to 10 times faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100 times speedup over LightRAG in retrieval while maintaining competitive QA performance.

  Tables are a fundamental structure for organizing and analyzing data, making effective table understanding a critical capability for intelligent systems. While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks, enabling a 7B model to outperform OpenAI o1 on table understanding. This highlights the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under (approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

  Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception, prediction and planing, which enables optimization in pursuit of the ultimate goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0 PDMS.

  Role-based access control (RBAC) and hierarchical structures are foundational to how information flows and decisions are made within virtually all organizations. As the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as unified knowledge repositories and intelligent assistants in enterprise settings becomes increasingly apparent, a critical, yet under explored, challenge emerges: \textit{can these models reliably understand and operate within the complex, often nuanced, constraints imposed by organizational hierarchies and associated permissions?} Evaluating this crucial capability is inherently difficult due to the proprietary and sensitive nature of real-world corporate data and access control policies. We introduce a synthetic yet representative \textbf{OrgAccess} benchmark consisting of 40 distinct types of permissions commonly relevant across different organizational roles and levels. We further create three types of permissions: 40,000 easy (1 permission), 10,000 medium (3-permissions tuple), and 20,000 hard (5-permissions tuple) to test LLMs' ability to accurately assess these permissions and generate responses that strictly adhere to the specified hierarchical rules, particularly in scenarios involving users with overlapping or conflicting permissions. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly to maintain compliance with role-based structures, even with explicit instructions, with their performance degrades further when navigating interactions involving two or more conflicting permissions. Specifically, even \textbf{GPT-4.1 only achieves an F1-Score of 0.27 on our hardest benchmark}. This demonstrates a critical limitation in LLMs' complex rule following and compositional reasoning capabilities beyond standard factual or STEM-based benchmarks, opening up a new paradigm for evaluating their fitness for practical, structured environments.

  Mathematical reasoning lies at the heart of artificial intelligence, underpinning applications in education, program verification, and research-level mathematical discovery. Mathematical competitions, in particular, present two challenging problem types: theorem-proving, requiring rigorous proofs of stated conclusions, and answer-construction, involving hypothesizing and formally verifying mathematical objects. Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively generate creative candidate answers but struggle with formal verification, while symbolic provers ensure rigor but cannot efficiently handle creative conjecture generation. We introduce the Enumerate-Conjecture-Prove (ECP) framework, a modular neuro-symbolic method integrating LLM-based enumeration and pattern-driven conjecturing with formal theorem proving. We present ConstructiveBench, a dataset of 3,431 answer-construction problems in various math competitions with verified Lean formalizations.On the ConstructiveBench dataset, ECP improves the accuracy of answer construction from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline of 14.54% to 45.06% using the GPT-4.1-mini model. Moreover, when combined with ECP's constructed answers, the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B model generates correct proofs for 858 of the 3,431 constructive problems in Lean, achieving 25.01% accuracy, compared to 9.86% for symbolic-only baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.

  We present a method for the automated discovery of system-level dynamics in Flow-Lenia--a continuous cellular automaton (CA) with mass conservation and parameter localization-using a curiosity--driven AI scientist. This method aims to uncover processes leading to self-organization of evolutionary and ecosystemic dynamics in CAs. We build on previous work which uses diversity search algorithms in Lenia to find self-organized individual patterns, and extend it to large environments that support distinct interacting patterns. We adapt Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs) to drive exploration of diverse Flow-Lenia environments using simulation-wide metrics, such as evolutionary activity, compression-based complexity, and multi-scale entropy. We test our method in two experiments, showcasing its ability to illuminate significantly more diverse dynamics compared to random search. We show qualitative results illustrating how ecosystemic simulations enable self-organization of complex collective behaviors not captured by previous individual pattern search and analysis. We complement automated discovery with an interactive exploration tool, creating an effective human-AI collaborative workflow for scientific investigation. Though demonstrated specifically with Flow-Lenia, this methodology provides a framework potentially applicable to other parameterizable complex systems where understanding emergent collective properties is of interest.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become powerful tools for complex problem solving, but their structured reasoning pathways can lead to unsafe outputs when exposed to harmful prompts. Existing safety alignment methods reduce harmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant trade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak attacks. To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight alignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at the start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the rest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while maintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful responses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than Direct Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot variant that requires no fine-tuning. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to reasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficiently modeling and exploiting opponents is a long-standing challenge in adversarial domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual data have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks, introducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies primarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the elaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these approaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain expertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented Planning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation capabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the Strategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we construct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome pair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP dynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by searching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating strategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental results show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it to perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent strategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS environment, SAP achieves a $85.35\%$ performance improvement over baseline methods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches against state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI.

- **[How well do LLMs reason over tabular data, really?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07453)**  `arXiv:2505.07453`  
  _Cornelius Wolff, Madelon Hulsebos_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks, but less is known about their reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Prior analyses devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries? Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1) missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations. Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their robustness for realistic tabular inputs.

  Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) augments large language models (LLMs) with the ability to invoke external tools during long-form reasoning, such as search engines and code interpreters, to solve tasks beyond the capabilities of internal reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training such agents, most of existing approaches typically optimize only for final correctness without considering the efficiency or necessity of external tool use. This often leads to excessive tool calling, incurring high computational costs and hindering the development of internal reasoning capabilities - a phenomenon known as \textit{cognitive offloading}. To this end, we propose Optimal Tool Call-controlled Policy Optimization (OTC-PO), a simple yet effective RL-based framework that encourages models to produce accurate answers with minimal tool calls. Our method introduces a tool-integrated reward that jointly considers answer correctness and corresponding tool use behavior of model to reach that answer. To validate the effectiveness, we introduce the metric of \textit{tool productivity}, defined as the ratio between the number of correct answers and the total number of tool calls across all test cases. This metric reflects how efficiently tool usage contributes to successful task completion, with higher values indicating smarter and more autonomous reasoning. We instantiate this framework within both Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), resulting in OTC-PPO and OTC-GRPO. Experiments with Qwen-2.5 and Qwen-Math across multiple QA benchmarks show that our approach reduces tool calls by up to 68.3\% and improves tool productivity by up to 215.4\%, while maintaining comparable answer accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to struggle with systematic reasoning. Even on tasks where they appear to perform well, their performance often depends on shortcuts, rather than on genuine reasoning abilities, leading them to collapse on out-of-distribution (OOD) examples. Post-training strategies based on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought prompting have recently been hailed as a step change. However, little is known about the potential of the resulting ``Large Reasoning Models'' (LRMs) beyond maths and programming-based problem solving, where genuine OOD problems can be sparse. In this paper, we focus on tasks that require systematic relational composition for qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. The setting allows fine control over problem difficulty to precisely measure OOD generalization. We find that, zero-shot LRMs generally outperform their LLM counterparts in single-path reasoning tasks but struggle in the multi-path setting. Whilst showing comparatively better results, fine-tuned LLMs are also not capable of multi-path generalization. We also provide evidence for the behavioral interpretation for this, i.e., that LRMs are shallow disjunctive reasoners.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-step spatial reasoning entails understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships across multiple sequential steps, which is crucial for tackling complex real-world applications, such as robotic manipulation, autonomous navigation, and automated assembly. To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, based on LEGO-Puzzles, we design generation tasks to investigate whether MLLMs can transfer their spatial understanding and reasoning abilities to image generation. Our experiments show that only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  World models aim to learn action-controlled future prediction and have proven essential for the development of intelligent agents. However, most existing world models rely heavily on substantial action-labeled data and costly training, making it challenging to adapt to novel environments with heterogeneous actions through limited interactions. This limitation can hinder their applicability across broader domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose AdaWorld, an innovative world model learning approach that enables efficient adaptation. The key idea is to incorporate action information during the pretraining of world models. This is achieved by extracting latent actions from videos in a self-supervised manner, capturing the most critical transitions between frames. We then develop an autoregressive world model that conditions on these latent actions. This learning paradigm enables highly adaptable world models, facilitating efficient transfer and learning of new actions even with limited interactions and finetuning. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple environments demonstrate that AdaWorld achieves superior performance in both simulation quality and visual planning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous systems that operate in continuous state, action, and observation spaces require planning and reasoning under uncertainty. Existing online planning methods for such POMDPs are almost exclusively sample-based, yet they forego the power of high-dimensional gradient optimization as combining it into Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has proved difficult, especially in non-parametric settings. We close this gap with three contributions. First, we derive a novel action-gradient theorem for both MDPs and POMDPs in terms of transition likelihoods, making gradient information accessible during tree search. Second, we introduce the Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS) tree, that re-uses samples for changing action branches, yielding consistent value estimates that enable in-search gradient steps. Third, we derive exact transition probability computation via the area formula for smooth generative models common in physical domains, a result of independent interest. These elements combine into Action-Gradient Monte Carlo Tree Search (AGMCTS), the first planner to blend non-parametric particle search with online gradient refinement in POMDPs. Across several challenging continuous MDP and POMDP benchmarks, AGMCTS outperforms widely-used sample-only solvers in solution quality.

  _Jeesu Jung, Chanjun Park, Sangkeun Jung_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent efforts in LLM alignment have focused on constructing large-scale preference datasets via human or Artificial Intelligence (AI) annotators. However, such approaches rely on instance-wise supervision, incurring substantial annotation cost and limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose ZEBRA - a model behavior-wise zero-annotation framework that constructs preference data by leveraging model behavior knowledge derived from benchmark performances. ZEBRA binarizes response pairs by evaluating the quality and similarity of their origin models, entirely bypassing instance-level annotation. This allows scalable, controllable, and cost-effective alignment data generation. Empirical results show that ZEBRA achieves alignment performance comparable to instance-supervised methods, despite requiring no manual or model-based labeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current approaches for training Process Reward Models (PRMs) often involve breaking down responses into multiple reasoning steps using rule-based techniques, such as using predefined placeholder tokens or setting the reasoning step's length into a fixed size. These approaches overlook the fact that specific words do not typically mark true decision points in a text. To address this, we propose AdaptiveStep, a method that divides reasoning steps based on the model's confidence in predicting the next word. This division method provides more decision-making information at each step, enhancing downstream tasks, such as reward model learning. Moreover, our method does not require manual annotation. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with AdaptiveStep-trained PRMs in mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Experimental results indicate that the outcome PRM achieves state-of-the-art Best-of-N performance, surpassing greedy search strategy with token-level value-guided decoding, while also reducing construction costs by over 30% compared to existing open-source PRMs. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis and case study on the PRM's performance, transferability, and generalization capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable breakthroughs, aligning their values with humans has become imperative for their responsible development and customized applications. However, there still lack evaluations of LLMs values that fulfill three desirable goals. (1) Value Clarification: We expect to clarify the underlying values of LLMs precisely and comprehensively, while current evaluations focus narrowly on safety risks such as bias and toxicity. (2) Evaluation Validity: Existing static, open-source benchmarks are prone to data contamination and quickly become obsolete as LLMs evolve. Additionally, these discriminative evaluations uncover LLMs' knowledge about values, rather than valid assessments of LLMs' behavioral conformity to values. (3) Value Pluralism: The pluralistic nature of human values across individuals and cultures is largely ignored in measuring LLMs value alignment. To address these challenges, we presents the Value Compass Benchmarks, with three correspondingly designed modules. It (i) grounds the evaluation on motivationally distinct \textit{basic values to clarify LLMs' underlying values from a holistic view; (ii) applies a \textit{generative evolving evaluation framework with adaptive test items for evolving LLMs and direct value recognition from behaviors in realistic scenarios; (iii) propose a metric that quantifies LLMs alignment with a specific value as a weighted sum over multiple dimensions, with weights determined by pluralistic values.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities in LLMs have recently become a central object of investigation. Cognitive science distinguishes between two steps required for ToM tasks: 1) determine whether to invoke ToM, which includes the appropriate Depth of Mentalizing (DoM), or level of recursion required to complete a task; and 2) applying the correct inference given the DoM. In this position paper, we first identify several lines of work in different communities in AI, including LLM benchmarking, ToM add-ons, ToM probing, and formal models for ToM. We argue that recent work in AI tends to focus exclusively on the second step which are typically framed as static logic problems. We conclude with suggestions for improved evaluation of ToM capabilities inspired by dynamic environments used in cognitive tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant disparity exists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We attribute this gap primarily to current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, especially in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are essential. In this paper, we introduce G-Pass@$k$, a novel evaluation metric that continuously assesses model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's performance potential and its stability. Through extensive experiments on various public and newly constructed benchmarks, we employ G-Pass@$k$ in conjunction with state-of-the-art large language models to provide comprehensive insights into their potential capabilities and operational consistency. Our findings reveal a significant opportunity to enhance the realistic reasoning abilities of LLMs, underscoring the necessity for more robust evaluation metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data is essential to train and fine-tune today's frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models and to develop future ones. To date, academic, legal, and regulatory work has primarily addressed how data can directly harm consumers and creators, such as through privacy breaches, copyright infringements, and bias and discrimination. Our work, instead, focuses on the comparatively neglected question of how data can enable new governance capacities for frontier AI models. This approach for "frontier data governance" opens up new avenues for monitoring and mitigating risks from advanced AI models, particularly as they scale and acquire specific dangerous capabilities. Still, frontier data governance faces challenges that stem from the fundamental properties of data itself: data is non-rival, often non-excludable, easily replicable, and increasingly synthesizable. Despite these inherent difficulties, we propose a set of policy mechanisms targeting key actors along the data supply chain, including data producers, aggregators, model developers, and data vendors. We provide a brief overview of 15 governance mechanisms, of which we centrally introduce five, underexplored policy recommendations. These include developing canary tokens to detect unauthorized use for producers; (automated) data filtering to remove malicious content for pre-training and post-training datasets; mandatory dataset reporting requirements for developers and vendors; improved security for datasets and data generation algorithms; and know-your-customer requirements for vendors. By considering data not just as a source of potential harm, but as a critical governance lever, this work aims to equip policymakers with a new tool for the governance and regulation of frontier AI models.

  Artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC), a rapidly advancing technology, is transforming content creation across domains, such as text, images, audio, and video. Its growing potential has attracted more and more researchers and investors to explore and expand its possibilities. This review traces AIGC's evolution through four developmental milestones-ranging from early rule-based systems to modern transfer learning models-within a unified framework that highlights how each milestone contributes uniquely to content generation. In particular, the paper employs a common example across all milestones to illustrate the capabilities and limitations of methods within each phase, providing a consistent evaluation of AIGC methodologies and their development. Furthermore, this paper addresses critical challenges associated with AIGC and proposes actionable strategies to mitigate them. This study aims to guide researchers and practitioners in selecting and optimizing AIGC models to enhance the quality and efficiency of content creation across diverse domains.

  _Seongmin Lee, Hsiang Hsu, Chun-Fu Chen, Duen Horng, Chau_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM hallucination, where unfaithful text is generated, presents a critical challenge for LLMs' practical applications. Current detection methods often resort to external knowledge, LLM fine-tuning, or supervised training with large hallucination-labeled datasets. Moreover, these approaches do not distinguish between different types of hallucinations, which is crucial for enhancing detection performance. To address such limitations, we introduce hallucination probing, a new task that classifies LLM-generated text into three categories: aligned, misaligned, and fabricated. Driven by our novel discovery that perturbing key entities in prompts affects LLM's generation of these three types of text differently, we propose SHINE, a novel hallucination probing method that does not require external knowledge, supervised training, or LLM fine-tuning. SHINE is effective in hallucination probing across three modern LLMs, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in hallucination detection, outperforming seven competing methods across four datasets and four LLMs, underscoring the importance of probing for accurate detection.

  Mobile agents are essential for automating tasks in complex and dynamic mobile environments. As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI-driven agents across various tasks. However, existing agentic systems, whether based on fixed pipeline algorithms or pre-defined meta-learning frameworks, cannot search the whole agent design space due to the restriction of human-designed components, and thus might miss the globally optimal agent design. In this paper, we introduce G√∂del Agent, a self-evolving framework inspired by the G√∂del machine, enabling agents to recursively improve themselves without relying on predefined routines or fixed optimization algorithms. G√∂del Agent leverages LLMs to dynamically modify its own logic and behavior, guided solely by high-level objectives through prompting. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and complex agent tasks demonstrate that implementation of G√∂del Agent can achieve continuous self-improvement, surpassing manually crafted agents in performance, efficiency, and generalizability.

  With the rapid advancement of large models (LMs), the development of general-purpose intelligent agents powered by LMs has become a reality. It is foreseeable that in the near future, LM-driven general AI agents will serve as essential tools in production tasks, capable of autonomous communication and collaboration without human intervention. This paper investigates scenarios involving the autonomous collaboration of future LM agents. We review the current state of LM agents, the key technologies enabling LM agent collaboration, and the security and privacy challenges they face during cooperative operations. To this end, we first explore the foundational principles of LM agents, including their general architecture, key components, enabling technologies, and modern applications. We then discuss practical collaboration paradigms from data, computation, and knowledge perspectives to achieve connected intelligence among LM agents. After that, we analyze the security vulnerabilities and privacy risks associated with LM agents, particularly in multi-agent settings, examining underlying mechanisms and reviewing current and potential countermeasures. Lastly, we propose future research directions for building robust and secure LM agent ecosystems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the structure and motion of the heart is crucial for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of global death. There is wide variation in cardiac shape and motion patterns, influenced by demographic, anthropometric and disease factors. Unravelling normal patterns of shape and motion, and understanding how each individual deviates from the norm, would facilitate accurate diagnosis and personalised treatment strategies. To this end, we developed a conditional generative model, MeshHeart, to learn the distribution of shape and motion patterns for the left and right ventricles of the heart. To model the high-dimensional spatio-temporal mesh data, MeshHeart employs a geometric encoder to represent cardiac meshes in a latent space, and a temporal Transformer to model the motion dynamics of latent representations. Based on MeshHeart, we investigate the latent space of 3D+t cardiac mesh sequences and propose a distance metric, latent delta, which quantifies the deviation of a real heart from its personalised normative pattern. In experiments using a large cardiac magnetic resonance image dataset of 38,309 subjects from the UK Biobank, MeshHeart demonstrates high performance in cardiac mesh sequence reconstruction and generation. Latent space features are discriminative for cardiac disease classification, whereas latent delta exhibits strong correlations with clinical phenotypes in phenome-wide association studies. The code and the trained model are released to support further research.

  _Jiahao Yuan, Zixiang Di, Zhiqing Cui, Guisong Yang, Usman Naseem_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, a major contribution to the history of epistemology, proposes a table of categories to elucidate the structure of the a priori principles underlying human judgment. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, grounded in functionalism, claims to simulate or replicate human judgment. To evaluate this claim, it is necessary to examine whether AI judgments exhibit the essential characteristics of human judgment. This paper investigates the unexplainability of AI judgments through the lens of Kant's theory of judgment. Drawing on Kant's four logical forms-quantity, quality, relation, and modality-this study identifies what may be called AI's uncertainty, a condition in which different forms of judgment become entangled. In particular, with regard to modality, this study argues that the SoftMax function forcibly reframes AI judgments as possibility judgments. Furthermore, since complete definitions in natural language are impossible, words are, by their very nature, ultimately unexplainable; therefore, a fully complete functional implementation is theoretically unattainable.

  Recent studies have delved into constructing generalist agents for open-world environments like Minecraft. Despite the encouraging results, existing efforts mainly focus on solving basic programmatic tasks, e.g., material collection and tool-crafting following the Minecraft tech-tree, treating the ObtainDiamond task as the ultimate goal. This limitation stems from the narrowly defined set of actions available to agents, requiring them to learn effective long-horizon strategies from scratch. Consequently, discovering diverse gameplay opportunities in the open world becomes challenging. In this work, we introduce Odyssey, a new framework that empowers Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with open-world skills to explore the vast Minecraft world. Odyssey comprises three key parts: (1) An interactive agent with an open-world skill library that consists of 40 primitive skills and 183 compositional skills. (2) A fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model trained on a large question-answering dataset with 390k+ instruction entries derived from the Minecraft Wiki. (3) A new agent capability benchmark includes the long-term planning task, the dynamic-immediate planning task, and the autonomous exploration task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Odyssey framework can effectively evaluate different capabilities of LLM-based agents. All datasets, model weights, and code are publicly available to motivate future research on more advanced autonomous agent solutions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models(LLMs), with their powerful language generation and reasoning capabilities, have already achieved notable success in many domains, e.g., math and code generation. However, they often fall short when tackling real-life geospatial tasks within urban environments. This limitation stems from a lack of physical world knowledge and relevant data during training. To address this gap, we propose \textit{CityGPT}, a systematic framework designed to enhance LLMs' understanding of urban space and improve their ability to solve the related urban tasks by integrating a city-scale `world model' into the model. Firstly, we construct a diverse instruction tuning dataset, \textit{CityInstruction}, for injecting urban knowledge into LLMs and effectively boosting their spatial reasoning capabilities. Using a combination of \textit{CityInstruction} and open source general instruction data, we introduce a novel and easy-to-use self-weighted fine-tuning method (\textit{SWFT}) to train various LLMs (including ChatGLM3-6B, Llama3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B) to enhance their urban spatial capabilities without compromising, or even improving, their general abilities. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we develop a comprehensive text-based spatial benchmark \textit{CityEval} for evaluating the performance of LLMs across a wide range of urban scenarios and geospatial tasks. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that smaller LLMs trained with \textit{CityInstruction} by \textit{SWFT} method can achieve performance that is competitive with, and in some cases superior to, proprietary LLMs when assessed using \textit{CityEval}.

  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain widespread use, establishing systematic and reliable evaluation methodologies for LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs) has become essential to ensure their real-world effectiveness and reliability. There have been some early explorations about the usability of LLMs for limited urban tasks, but a systematic and scalable evaluation benchmark is still lacking. The challenge in constructing a systematic evaluation benchmark for urban research lies in the diversity of urban data, the complexity of application scenarios and the highly dynamic nature of the urban environment. In this paper, we design \textit{CityBench}, an interactive simulator based evaluation platform, as the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs for diverse tasks in urban research. First, we build \textit{CityData} to integrate the diverse urban data and \textit{CitySimu} to simulate fine-grained urban dynamics. Based on \textit{CityData} and \textit{CitySimu}, we design 8 representative urban tasks in 2 categories of perception-understanding and decision-making as the \textit{CityBench}. With extensive results from 30 well-known LLMs and VLMs in 13 cities around the world, we find that advanced LLMs and VLMs can achieve competitive performance in diverse urban tasks requiring commonsense and semantic understanding abilities, e.g., understanding the human dynamics and semantic inference of urban images. Meanwhile, they fail to solve the challenging urban tasks requiring professional knowledge and high-level numerical abilities, e.g., geospatial prediction and traffic control task.

  The performance of a constraint model can often be improved by converting a subproblem into a single table constraint (referred to as tabulation). Finding subproblems to tabulate is traditionally a manual and time-intensive process, even for expert modellers. This paper presents TabID, an entirely automated method to identify promising subproblems for tabulation in constraint programming. We introduce a diverse set of heuristics designed to identify promising candidates for tabulation, aiming to improve solver performance. These heuristics are intended to encapsulate various factors that contribute to useful tabulation. We also present additional checks to limit the potential drawbacks of suboptimal tabulation.We comprehensively evaluate our approach using benchmark problems from existing literature that previously relied on manual identification by constraint programming experts of constraints to tabulate. We demonstrate that our automated identification and tabulation process achieves comparable, and in some cases improved results. We empirically evaluate the efficacy of our approach on a variety of solvers, including standard CP (Minion and Gecode), clause-learning CP (Chuffed and OR-Tools) and SAT solvers (Kissat).Our findings highlight the substantial potential of fully automated tabulation, suggesting its integration into automated model reformulation tools.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have proven highly effective for tasks requiring factual consistency and robust knowledge retrieval. However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks. WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro, there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena, highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering (MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically, on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs, outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.

  Effective wastewater and stormwater management is essential for urban sustainability and environmental protection. Extracting structured knowledge from reports and regulations is challenging due to domainspecific terminology and multilingual contexts. This work focuses on domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) as a first step towards effective relation and information extraction to support decision making. A multilingual benchmark is crucial for evaluating these methods. This study develops a French-Italian domain-specific text corpus for wastewater management. It evaluates state-of-the-art NER methods, including LLM-based approaches, to provide a reliable baseline for future strategies and explores automated annotation projection in view of an extension of the corpus to new languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward models are used throughout the post-training of language models to capture nuanced signals from preference data and provide a training target for optimization across instruction following, reasoning, safety, and more domains. The community has begun establishing best practices for evaluating reward models, from the development of benchmarks that test capabilities in specific skill areas to others that test agreement with human preferences. At the same time, progress in evaluation has not been mirrored by the effectiveness of reward models in downstream tasks -- simpler direct alignment algorithms are reported to work better in many cases. This paper introduces RewardBench 2, a new multi-skill reward modeling benchmark designed to bring new, challenging data for accuracy-based reward model evaluation -- models score about 20 points on average lower on RewardBench 2 compared to the first RewardBench -- while being highly correlated with downstream performance. Compared to most other benchmarks, RewardBench 2 sources new human prompts instead of existing prompts from downstream evaluations, facilitating more rigorous evaluation practices. In this paper, we describe our benchmark construction process and report how existing models perform on it, while quantifying how performance on the benchmark correlates with downstream use of the models in both inference-time scaling algorithms, like best-of-N sampling, and RLHF training algorithms like proximal policy optimization.

  Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation. Among this family of models, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) achieve the strongest performance but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack key inference-time efficiency features--most notably, KV caching. In this work, we introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms, enabling smooth interpolation between their perplexities while overcoming their respective limitations. Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on standard language modeling benchmarks. Crucially, we are the **first to introduce KV caching for MDMs** while preserving parallel generation, significantly improving inference efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, our method achieves up to **65x** faster inference than standard MDMs and **4x** faster inference than prior semi-autoregressive approaches.

  This paper addresses critical gaps in Arabic language model evaluation by establishing comprehensive theoretical guidelines and introducing a novel evaluation framework. We first analyze existing Arabic evaluation datasets, identifying significant issues in linguistic accuracy, cultural alignment, and methodological rigor. To address these limitations in LLMs, we present the Arabic Depth Mini Dataset (ADMD), a carefully curated collection of 490 challenging questions spanning ten major domains (42 sub-domains, see Figure 1. Using ADMD, we evaluate five leading language models: GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Flash 1.5, CommandR 100B, and Qwen-Max. Our results reveal significant variations in model performance across different domains, with particular challenges in areas requiring deep cultural understanding and specialized knowledge. Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated the highest overall accuracy at 30\%, showing relative strength in mathematical theory in Arabic, Arabic language, and islamic domains. This work provides both theoretical foundations and practical insights for improving Arabic language model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of cultural competence alongside technical capabilities.

  Image mass cytometry (IMC) enables high-dimensional spatial profiling by combining mass cytometry's analytical power with spatial distributions of cell phenotypes. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context. However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach. Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices, pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Omni-modal language models (OLMs) aim to integrate and reason over diverse input modalities--such as text, images, video, and audio--while maintaining strong language capabilities. Despite recent advancements, existing models, especially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to generalize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve strong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of extending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models, where an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and language data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does modality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging effectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to achieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better knowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through extensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into the feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Conversational Function-Calling Evaluation Through Turn-Level Interactions (CONFETTI), a conversational benchmark1 designed to evaluate the function-calling capabilities and response quality of large language models (LLMs). Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109 human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs. These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs, conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than 20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5 (35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and Mistral-Large-2407 (30.07%).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language, cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns generalise well to unseen language pairs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Team BD's submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification) and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification of tutor responses in educational dialogues - determining if a tutor correctly recognizes a student's mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the mistake's location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based language model that combines BERT and XLNet's pre-training advantages. We fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by combining multiple classifiers. Our approach achieved strong results on both tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We include comprehensive analysis of our system's performance, including confusion matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The conflict in Ukraine has been not only characterised by military engagement but also by a significant information war, with social media platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter playing an important role in shaping public perception. This article provides an analysis of tweets from propaganda accounts and trusted accounts collected from the onset of the war, February 2022 until the middle of May 2022 with n=40,000 total tweets. We utilise natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to assess the sentiment and identify key themes, topics and narratives across the dataset with human-in-the-loop (HITL) analysis throughout. Our findings indicate distinct strategies in how information is created, spread, and targeted at different audiences by both sides. Propaganda accounts frequently employ emotionally charged language and disinformation to evoke fear and distrust, whereas other accounts, primarily Western tend to focus on factual reporting and humanitarian aspects of the conflict. Clustering analysis reveals groups of accounts with similar behaviours, which we suspect indicates the presence of coordinated efforts. This research attempts to contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of information warfare and offers techniques for future studies on social media influence in military conflicts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in translating extremely low-resource languages using resources like dictionaries, the effectiveness of grammar books remains debated. This paper investigates the role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation. Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation.

  Currently, nearly all evaluations of foundation models focus on objective metrics, emphasizing quiz performance to define model capabilities. While this model-centric approach enables rapid performance assessment, it fails to reflect authentic human experiences. To address this gap, we propose a Human-Centric subjective Evaluation (HCE) framework, focusing on three core dimensions: problem-solving ability, information quality, and interaction experience. Through experiments involving Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3 mini, Grok 3, and Gemini 2.5, we conduct over 540 participant-driven evaluations, where humans and models collaborate on open-ended research tasks, yielding a comprehensive subjective dataset. This dataset captures diverse user feedback across multiple disciplines, revealing distinct model strengths and adaptability. Our findings highlight Grok 3's superior performance, followed by Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.5, with OpenAI o3 mini lagging behind. By offering a novel framework and a rich dataset, this study not only enhances subjective evaluation methodologies but also lays the foundation for standardized, automated assessments, advancing LLM development for research and practical scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

  With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, the ability to follow instructions has emerged as a key metric for evaluating their practical utility. However, existing evaluation methods often focus on single-language scenarios, overlooking the challenges and differences present in multilingual and cross-lingual contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MaXIFE: a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess instruction-following capabilities across 23 languages with 1,667 verifiable instruction tasks. MaXIFE integrates both Rule-Based Evaluation and Model-Based Evaluation, ensuring a balance of efficiency and accuracy. We applied MaXIFE to evaluate several leading commercial and open-source LLMs, establishing baseline results for future comparisons. By providing a standardized tool for multilingual instruction-following evaluation, MaXIFE aims to advance research and development in natural language processing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Kwak'wala is an Indigenous language spoken in British Columbia, with a rich legacy of published documentation spanning more than a century, and an active community of speakers, teachers, and learners engaged in language revitalization. Over 11 volumes of the earliest texts created during the collaboration between Franz Boas and George Hunt have been scanned but remain unreadable by machines. Complete digitization through optical character recognition has the potential to facilitate transliteration into modern orthographies and the creation of other language technologies. In this paper, we apply the latest OCR techniques to a series of Kwak'wala texts only accessible as images, and discuss the challenges and unique adaptations necessary to make such technologies work for these real-world texts. Building on previous methods, we propose using a mix of off-the-shelf OCR methods, language identification, and masking to effectively isolate Kwak'wala text, along with post-correction models, to produce a final high-quality transcription.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant interest in Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) for applications such as emotional companionship and virtual interaction. However, recent RPAs are often built on explicit dialogue data, lacking deep, human-like internal thought processes, resulting in superficial knowledge and style expression. While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role) and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style Optimization (RSO). RIA explicitly guides the model with character profiles during reasoning to counteract attention diversion, and then RSO aligns reasoning style with the character and scene via LRM distillation to mitigate style drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAR significantly enhances the performance of RPAs by effectively addressing attention diversion and style drift.

  _Jiandong Shao, Yao Lu, Jianfei Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet they frequently fail on basic numerical problems, producing incorrect outputs. Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model behavior. Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large amounts of data from different sources and domains. These data most often contain trillions of tokens with large portions of copyrighted or proprietary content, which hinders the usage of such models under AI legislation. This raises the need for truly open pre-training data that is compliant with the data security regulations. In this paper, we introduce Common Corpus, the largest open dataset for language model pre-training. The data assembled in Common Corpus are either uncopyrighted or under permissible licenses and amount to about two trillion tokens. The dataset contains a wide variety of languages, ranging from the main European languages to low-resource ones rarely present in pre-training datasets; in addition, it includes a large portion of code data. The diversity of data sources in terms of covered domains and time periods opens up the paths for both research and entrepreneurial needs in diverse areas of knowledge. In this technical report, we present the detailed provenance of data assembling and the details of dataset filtering and curation. Being already used by such industry leaders as Anthropic and multiple LLM training projects, we believe that Common Corpus will become a critical infrastructure for open science research in LLMs.

  _Soyoung Oh, Xinting Huang, Mathis Pink, Michael Hahn, Vera Demberg_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their non-compositional figurative meanings, which often strongly diverge from the idiom's literal interpretation. This duality requires a model to learn representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer (LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in an autoregressive transformer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality.

  Table reasoning, encompassing tasks such as table question answering, fact verification, and text-to-SQL, requires precise understanding of structured tabular data, coupled with numerical computation and code manipulation for effective inference. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have achieved notable success but often struggle with generalization and robustness due to biases inherent in imitative learning. We introduce Reasoning-Table, the first application of reinforcement learning (RL) to table reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Through rigorous data preprocessing, reward design, and tailored training strategies, our method leverages simple rule-based outcome rewards to outperform SFT across multiple benchmarks. Unified training across diverse tasks enables Reasoning-Table to emerge as a robust table reasoning large language model, surpassing larger proprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet by 4.0% on table reasoning benchmarks. The approach also achieves excellent performance on text-to-SQL tasks, reaching 68.3% performance on the BIRD dev dataset with a 7B model. Further experiments demonstrate that Reasoning-Table enhances the model's generalization capabilities and robustness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate fairness dynamics during Large Language Model (LLM) training to enable the diagnoses of biases and mitigations through training interventions like early stopping; we find that biases can emerge suddenly and do not always follow common performance metrics. We introduce two new metrics to evaluate fairness dynamics holistically during model pre-training: Average Rank and Jensen-Shannon Divergence by Parts. These metrics provide insights into the Pythia models' progression of biases in gender prediction of occupations on the WinoBias dataset. By monitoring these dynamics, we find that (1) Pythia-6.9b is biased towards men; it becomes more performant and confident predicting "male" than "female" during training, (2) via early-stopping, Pythia-6.9b can exchange 1.7% accuracy on LAMBADA for a 92.5% increase in fairness, and (3) larger models can exhibit more bias; Pythia-6.9b makes more assumptions about gender than Pythia-160m, even when a subject's gender is not specified.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The large language models (LLMs) are able to generate high-quality texts in multiple languages. Such texts are often not recognizable by humans as generated, and therefore present a potential of LLMs for misuse (e.g., plagiarism, spams, disinformation spreading). An automated detection is able to assist humans to indicate the machine-generated texts; however, its robustness to out-of-distribution data is still challenging. This notebook describes our mdok approach in robust detection, based on fine-tuning smaller LLMs for text classification. It is applied to both subtasks of Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025, providing remarkable performance in binary detection as well as in multiclass (1st rank) classification of various cases of human-AI collaboration.

  Affective Computing (AC) is essential in bridging the gap between human emotional experiences and machine understanding. Traditionally, AC tasks in natural language processing (NLP) have been approached through pipeline architectures, which often suffer from structure rigidity that leads to inefficiencies and limited adaptability. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized this field by offering a unified approach to affective understanding and generation tasks, enhancing the potential for dynamic, real-time interactions. However, LLMs face cognitive limitations in affective reasoning, such as misinterpreting cultural nuances or contextual emotions, and hallucination problems in decision-making. To address these challenges, recent research advocates for LLM-based collaboration systems that emphasize interactions among specialized models and LLMs, mimicking human-like affective intelligence through the synergy of emotional and rational thinking that aligns with Dual Process Theory in psychology. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM-based collaboration systems in AC, exploring from structured collaborations to autonomous collaborations. Specifically, it includes: (1) A systematic review of existing methods, focusing on collaboration strategies, mechanisms, key functions, and applications; (2) Experimental comparisons of collaboration strategies across representative tasks in affective understanding and generation; (3) An analysis highlighting the potential of these systems to enhance robustness and adaptability in complex affective reasoning; (4) A discussion of key challenges and future research directions to further advance the field. This work is the first to systematically explore collaborative intelligence with LLMs in AC, paving the way for more powerful applications that approach human-like social intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Subword-level understanding is integral to numerous tasks, including understanding multi-digit numbers, spelling mistakes, abbreviations, rhyming, and wordplay. Despite this, current large language models (LLMs) still often struggle with seemingly simple subword-level tasks like How many 'r's in 'strawberry'?. A key factor behind these failures is tokenization which obscures the fine-grained structure of words. Current alternatives, such as character-level and dropout tokenization methods, significantly increase computational costs and provide inconsistent improvements. In this paper we revisit tokenization and introduce StochasTok, a simple, efficient stochastic tokenization scheme that randomly splits tokens during training, allowing LLMs to 'see' their internal structure. Our experiments show that pretraining with StochasTok substantially improves LLMs' downstream performance across multiple subword-level language games, including character counting, substring identification, and math tasks. Furthermore, StochasTok's simplicity allows seamless integration at any stage of the training pipeline; and we demonstrate that post-training with StochasTok can instill improved subword understanding into existing pretrained models, thus avoiding costly pretraining from scratch. These dramatic improvements achieved with a minimal change suggest StochasTok holds exciting potential when applied to larger, more capable models. Code open-sourced at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite substantial research efforts evaluating how well large language models~(LLMs) handle global cultural diversity, the mechanisms behind their cultural knowledge acquisition, particularly in multilingual settings, remain unclear. We study this question by investigating how cultural knowledge transfers across languages during language adaptation of LLMs. We introduce an interpretable framework for studying this transfer, ensuring training data transparency and controlling transfer effects. Through a study of four non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more easily, which is supported by empirical analysis of the training corpora.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1 136 multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling transparent evaluation and supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231 foundational frameworks, standards, reports and recommendation documents from seven authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and adaptation potential of the model, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (ranging from 0.5 B to 671 B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies typically around 55--70\%, highlighting ESGenius's challenging nature for LLMs in interdisciplinary contexts. However, models employing RAG show significant performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example, "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B" improves from 63.82\% (zero-shot) to 80.46\% with RAG. These results underscore the necessity of grounding responses in authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our knowledge, ESGenius is the first benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant enhancement technologies that focuses on ESG and sustainability topics.

  Multilingual language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to transfer knowledge across languages, despite being trained without explicit cross-lingual supervision. We analyze the parameter spaces of three MLLMs to study how their representations evolve during pre-training, observing patterns consistent with compression: models initially form language-specific representations, which gradually converge into cross-lingual abstractions as training progresses. Through probing experiments, we observe a clear transition from uniform language identification capabilities across layers to more specialized layer functions. For deeper analysis, we focus on neurons that encode distinct semantic concepts. By tracing their development during pre-training, we show how they gradually align across languages. Notably, we identify specific neurons that emerge as increasingly reliable predictors for the same concepts across languages.

  Fake news on social media is a widespread and serious problem in today's society. Existing fake news detection methods focus on finding clues from Long text content, such as original news articles and user comments. This paper solves the problem of fake news detection in more realistic scenarios. Only source shot-text tweet and its retweet users are provided without user comments. We develop a novel neural network based model, \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{N}etworks (MVAN) to detect fake news and provide explanations on social media. The MVAN model includes text semantic attention and propagation structure attention, which ensures that our model can capture information and clues both of source tweet content and propagation structure. In addition, the two attention mechanisms in the model can find key clue words in fake news texts and suspicious users in the propagation structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that MVAN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by 2.5\% in accuracy on average, and produce a reasonable explanation.

  Pre-trained language models such as BERT have been proved to be powerful in many natural language processing tasks. But in some text classification applications such as emotion recognition and sentiment analysis, BERT may not lead to satisfactory performance. This often happens in applications where keywords play critical roles in the prediction of class labels. Our investigation found that the root cause of the problem is that the context-based BERT embedding of the keywords may not be discriminative enough to produce discriminative text representation for classification. Motivated by this finding, we develop a method to enhance word embeddings using domain-specific lexical knowledge. The knowledge-based embedding enhancement model projects the BERT embedding into a new space where within-class similarity and between-class difference are maximized. To implement the knowledge-based word embedding enhancement model, we also develop a knowledge acquisition algorithm for automatically collecting lexical knowledge from online open sources. Experiment results on three classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition and question answering, have shown the effectiveness of our proposed word embedding enhancing model.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1) evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world information-seeking tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot and few-shot tasks, but achieving similar performance with encoder-only models like BERT and RoBERTa has been challenging due to their architecture. However, encoders offer advantages such as lower computational and memory costs. Recent work adapts them for zero-shot generalization using Statement Tuning, which reformulates tasks into finite templates. We extend this approach to multilingual NLP, exploring whether encoders can achieve zero-shot cross-lingual generalization and serve as efficient alternatives to memory-intensive LLMs for low-resource languages. Our results show that state-of-the-art encoder models generalize well across languages, rivaling multilingual LLMs while being more efficient. We also analyze multilingual Statement Tuning dataset design, efficiency gains, and language-specific generalization, contributing to more inclusive and resource-efficient NLP models. We release our code and models.

  The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu. Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of news.

  Large language model performance can be improved in a large number of ways. Many such techniques, like fine-tuning or advanced tool usage, are time-intensive and expensive. Although prompt engineering is significantly cheaper and often works for simpler tasks, it remains unclear whether prompt engineering suffices for more complex domains like forecasting. Here we show that small prompt modifications rarely boost forecasting accuracy beyond a minimal baseline. In our first study, we tested 38 prompts across Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.1 405B. In our second, we introduced compound prompts and prompts from external sources, also including the reasoning models o1 and o1-mini. Our results show that most prompts lead to negligible gains, although references to base rates yield slight benefits. Surprisingly, some strategies showed strong negative effects on accuracy: especially encouraging the model to engage in Bayesian reasoning. These results suggest that, in the context of complex tasks like forecasting, basic prompt refinements alone offer limited gains, implying that more robust or specialized techniques may be required for substantial performance improvements in AI forecasting.

  Culture is a rich and dynamic domain that evolves across both geography and time. However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural imagethis http URLformer task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of only 42\%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and creative adaptation.

  Cross-lingual vocabulary transfer plays a promising role in adapting pre-trained language models to new languages, including low-resource languages. Existing approaches that utilize monolingual or parallel corpora face challenges when applied to languages with limited resources. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective vocabulary transfer method that utilizes bilingual dictionaries, which are available for many languages, thanks to descriptive linguists. Our proposed method leverages a property of BPE tokenizers where removing a subword from the vocabulary causes a fallback to shorter subwords. The embeddings of target subwords are estimated iteratively by progressively removing them from the tokenizer. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods for low-resource languages, demonstrating the effectiveness of a dictionary-based approach for cross-lingual vocabulary transfer.

  High-quality math datasets are crucial for advancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing datasets often suffer from three key issues: outdated and insufficient challenging content, neglecting human-like reasoning, and limited reliability due to single-LLM generation. To address these, we introduce $\textbf{STORM-BORN}$, an ultra-challenging dataset of mathematical derivations sourced from cutting-edge academic papers, which includes dense human-like approximations and heuristic cues. To ensure the reliability and quality, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data generation framework, integrating reasoning-dense filters, multi-agent collaboration, and human mathematicians' evaluations. We curated a set of 2,000 synthetic samples and deliberately selected the 100 most difficult problems. Even most advanced models like GPT-o1 solved fewer than $5\%$ of them. Fine-tuning on STORM-BORN boosts accuracy by $7.84\%$ (LLaMA3-8B) and $9.12\%$ (Qwen2.5-7B). As AI approaches mathematician-level reasoning, STORM-BORN provides both a high-difficulty benchmark and a human-like reasoning training resource.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the continued proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) based chatbots, there is a growing demand for generating responses that are not only linguistically fluent but also consistently aligned with persona-specific traits in conversations. However, existing role-play and persona-based chat approaches rely heavily on static role descriptions, coarse-grained signal space, and low-quality synthetic data, which fail to capture dynamic fine-grained details in human-like chat. Human-like chat requires modeling subtle latent traits, such as emotional tone, situational awareness, and evolving personality, which are difficult to predefine and cannot be easily learned from synthetic or distillation-based data. To address these limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework, containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained, interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData, and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in the human-like domain. Experiments show that LLMs based on V-VAE consistently outperform standard baselines on HumanChatBench and DialogBench, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of V-VAE and HumanChatData.

  Online form filling is a common yet labor-intensive task involving extensive keyboard and mouse interactions. Despite the long-standing vision of automating this process with "one click", existing tools remain largely rule-based and lack generalizable, generative capabilities. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled promising agents for GUI-related tasks in general-purpose scenarios. However, they struggle with the unique challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module, and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent difficulty of the task. These findings also reveal significant limitations in current models' visual layout reasoning and field-value alignment abilities. We hope our benchmark can serve as a stepping stone for further research into robust, practical form-filling agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rational speakers are supposed to know what they know and what they do not know, and to generate expressions matching the strength of evidence. In contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable. To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge of epistemic modality in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI. Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore, the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values. Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing Chinese characteristics. All data are available atthis https URL, and the code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose the first multilingual study on definition modeling. We use monolingual dictionary data for four new languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German) and perform an in-depth empirical study to test the performance of pre-trained multilingual language models on definition modeling of monosemic words when finetuned on this data. Furthermore, we use a zero-shot approach to test the multilingual capabilities of two popular chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in the task. Results show that multilingual language models can perform on-pair with English but cannot leverage potential cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally offering better performance overall. A comprehensive human evaluation of the LLM-generated definition highlights the zero and few-shot capabilities of these models in this new task, also showing their shortcomings. Finally, we show that performance on our task via BERTScore strongly correlates to the performance on multilingual LLM benchmarks, suggesting that our task offers a viable compute-constrained, stable and natural alternative to these.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text, has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct PARADEHATE, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech detoxification. We release PARADEHATE as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on PARADEHATE, achieve better performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable alternative to human annotation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computational models of pragmatic language use have traditionally relied on hand-specified sets of utterances and meanings, limiting their applicability to real-world language use. We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances probabilistic cognitive models by integrating LLM-based modules to propose and evaluate key components in natural language, eliminating the need for manual specification. Through a classic case study of pragmatic question-answering, we systematically examine various approaches to incorporating neural modules into the cognitive model -- from evaluating utilities and literal semantics to generating alternative utterances and goals. We find that hybrid models can match or exceed the performance of traditional probabilistic models in predicting human answer patterns. However, the success of the neuro-symbolic model depends critically on how LLMs are integrated: while they are particularly effective for proposing alternatives and transforming abstract goals into utilities, they face challenges with truth-conditional semantic evaluation. This work charts a path toward more flexible and scalable models of pragmatic language use while illuminating crucial design considerations for balancing neural and symbolic components.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt-based text embedding models, which generate task-specific embeddings upon receiving tailored prompts, have recently demonstrated remarkable performance. However, their resulting embeddings often have thousands of dimensions, leading to high storage costs and increased computational costs of embedding-based operations. In this paper, we investigate how post-hoc dimensionality reduction applied to the embeddings affects the performance of various tasks that leverage these embeddings, specifically classification, clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. Our experiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only the first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight performance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant. Notably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to less than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is very small. To quantitatively analyze this redundancy, we perform an analysis based on the intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy of the embeddings. Our analysis reveals that embeddings for classification and clustering, which are considered to have very high dimensional redundancy, exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality and less isotropy compared with those for retrieval and STS.

  _Kyuyoung Kim, Hyunjun Jeon, Jinwoo Shin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains, where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text poses emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4), raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external costly models at inference time. We leverage adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are used to distill anonymization, adversarial inference, and utility evaluation capabilities into SLMs via supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn to both anonymize text and critique their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy. These results show the effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework in training SLMs as efficient anonymizers. To facilitate further research, we release the full dataset used in our experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce UniversalCEFR, a large-scale multilingual multidimensional dataset of texts annotated according to the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference) scale in 13 languages. To enable open research in both automated readability and language proficiency assessment, UniversalCEFR comprises 505,807 CEFR-labeled texts curated from educational and learner-oriented resources, standardized into a unified data format to support consistent processing, analysis, and modeling across tasks and languages. To demonstrate its utility, we conduct benchmark experiments using three modelling paradigms: a) linguistic feature-based classification, b) fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs, and c) descriptor-based prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our results further support using linguistic features and fine-tuning pretrained models in multilingual CEFR level assessment. Overall, UniversalCEFR aims to establish best practices in data distribution in language proficiency research by standardising dataset formats and promoting their accessibility to the global research community.

  This study provides the first comprehensive comparison of New York Times-style text generated by six large language models against real, human-authored NYT writing. The comparison is based on a formal syntactic theory. We use Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) to analyze the grammatical structure of the texts. We then investigate and illustrate the differences in the distributions of HPSG grammar types, revealing systematic distinctions between human and LLM-generated writing. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the syntactic behavior of LLMs as well as humans, within the NYT genre.

  The popularity of automatic speech-to-speech translation for human conversations is growing, but the quality varies significantly depending on the language pair. In a context of community interpreting for low-resource languages, namely Turkish and Pashto to/from French, we collected fine-tuning and testing data, and compared systems using several automatic metrics (BLEU, COMET, and BLASER) and human assessments. The pipelines included automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis, with local models and cloud-based commercial ones. Some components have been fine-tuned on our data. We evaluated over 60 pipelines and determined the best one for each direction. We also found that the ranks of components are generally independent of the rest of the pipeline.

  _Yilong Lai, Jialong Wu, Zhenglin Wang, Deyu Zhou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompting-based conversational query reformulation has emerged as a powerful approach for conversational search, refining ambiguous user queries into standalone search queries. Best-of-N reformulation over the generated candidates via prompting shows impressive potential scaling capability. However, both the previous tuning methods (training time) and adaptation approaches (test time) can not fully unleash their benefits. In this paper, we propose AdaRewriter, a novel framework for query reformulation using an outcome-supervised reward model via test-time adaptation. By training a lightweight reward model with contrastive ranking loss, AdaRewriter selects the most promising reformulation during inference. Notably, it can operate effectively in black-box systems, including commercial LLM APIs. Experiments on five conversational search datasets show that AdaRewriter significantly outperforms the existing methods across most settings, demonstrating the potential of test-time adaptation for conversational query reformulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating psychological counseling responses with language models relies heavily on high-quality datasets. Crowdsourced data collection methods require strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions, ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling responses and the automatic evaluation of counseling dialogues.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long chains of thought (CoTs). Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Qwen3-4B on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum ($k$ up to $256$), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher $k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$ performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes. However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which traces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response. Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves explainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We propose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post hoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart, then converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths. Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types. Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite impressive advances in large language models (LLMs), existing benchmarks often focus on single-turn or single-step tasks, failing to capture the kind of iterative reasoning required in real-world settings. To address this limitation, we introduce TurnBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates multi-turn, multi-step reasoning through an interactive code-breaking task inspired by a "Turing Machine Board Game." In each episode, a model must uncover hidden logical or arithmetic rules by making sequential guesses, receiving structured feedback, and integrating clues across multiple rounds. This dynamic setup requires models to reason over time, adapt based on past information, and maintain consistency across steps-capabilities underexplored in current benchmarks. TurnBench includes two modes: Classic, which tests standard reasoning, and Nightmare, which introduces increased complexity and requires robust inferential chains. To support fine-grained analysis, we provide ground-truth annotations for intermediate reasoning steps. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant gaps: the best model achieves 81.5% accuracy in Classic mode, but performance drops to 17.8% in Nightmare mode. In contrast, human participants achieve 100% in both, underscoring the challenge TurnBench poses to current models. By incorporating feedback loops and hiding task rules, TurnBench reduces contamination risks and provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing multi-step, multi-turn reasoning in LLMs.

  The emergence of ChatGPT marked a transformative milestone for Artificial Intelligence (AI), showcasing the remarkable potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like text. This wave of innovation has revolutionized how we interact with technology, seamlessly integrating LLMs into everyday tasks such as vacation planning, email drafting, and content creation. While English-speaking users have significantly benefited from these advancements, the Arabic world faces distinct challenges in developing Arabic-specific LLMs. Arabic, one of the languages spoken most widely around the world, serves more than 422 million native speakers in 27 countries and is deeply rooted in a rich linguistic and cultural heritage. Developing Arabic LLMs (ALLMs) presents an unparalleled opportunity to bridge technological gaps and empower communities. The journey of ALLMs has been both fascinating and complex, evolving from rudimentary text processing systems to sophisticated AI-driven models. This article explores the trajectory of ALLMs, from their inception to the present day, highlighting the efforts to evaluate these models through benchmarks and public leaderboards. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities that ALLMs present for the Arab world.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) decompose image classification into a process governed by interpretable, human-readable concepts. Recent advances in CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts. However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our method not only improves classification accuracy by 6% but also enhances interpretability assessments by 30%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Psychological support hotlines are critical for crisis intervention but face significant challenges due to rising demand. Large language models (LLMs) could support crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive contexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540 annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline, assessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection, suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across 15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with statistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779), and risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood status recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost vocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) surpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like QwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though closed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled with size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with minimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured psychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition remains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open- and closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests feasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to guide model development and ethical deployment in mental health.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models (LMs) require robust episodic grounding-the capacity to learn from and apply past experiences-to excel at physical planning tasks. Current episodic grounding approaches struggle with scalability and integration, limiting their effectiveness, especially for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters). While larger LMs (70-405B parameters) possess superior hierarchical representations and extensive pre-trained knowledge, they encounter a fundamental scale paradox: despite their advanced abstraction capabilities, they lack efficient mechanisms to leverage experience streams. We propose a scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that effectively transfers episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. This framework integrates Monte Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel distillation method, preserving the inherent LM capabilities while embedding episodic memory. Experiments demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks. Layer-wise probing further indicates significant improvements in task alignment, especially within deeper LM layers, highlighting stable generalization even for previously unseen scenarios with increased planning complexity-conditions where baseline methods degrade markedly.

  Medical benchmarks are indispensable for evaluating the capabilities of language models in healthcare for non-English-speaking communities,therefore help ensuring the quality of real-life applications. However, not every community has sufficient resources and standardized methods to effectively build and design such benchmark, and available non-English medical data is normally fragmented and difficult to verify. We developed an approach to tackle this problem and applied it to create the first Vietnamese medical question benchmark, featuring 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 34 medical specialties. Our benchmark was constructed using various verifiable sources, including carefully curated medical exams and clinical records, and eventually annotated by medical experts. The benchmark includes four difficulty levels, ranging from foundational biological knowledge commonly found in textbooks to typical clinical case studies that require advanced reasoning. This design enables assessment of both the breadth and depth of language models' medical understanding in the target language thanks to its extensive coverage and in-depth subject-specific expertise. We release the benchmark in three parts: a sample public set (4k questions), a full public set (10k questions), and a private set (2k questions) used for leaderboard evaluation. Each set contains all medical subfields and difficulty levels. Our approach is scalable to other languages, and we open-source our data construction pipeline to support the development of future multilingual benchmarks in the medical domain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Universal information extraction (UIE) primarily employs an extractive generation approach with large language models (LLMs), typically outputting structured information based on predefined schemas such as JSON or tables. UIE suffers from a lack of adaptability when selecting between predefined schemas and on-the-fly schema generation within the in-context learning paradigm, especially when there are numerous schemas to choose from. In this paper, we propose a unified adaptive text-to-structure generation framework, called Schema as Parameterized Tools (SPT), which reimagines the tool-calling capability of LLMs by treating predefined schemas as parameterized tools for tool selection and parameter filling. Specifically, our SPT method can be applied to unify closed, open, and on-demand IE tasks by adopting Schema Retrieval by fetching the relevant schemas from a predefined pool, Schema Filling by extracting information and filling slots as with tool parameters, or Schema Generation by synthesizing new schemas with uncovered cases. Experiments show that the SPT method can handle four distinct IE tasks adaptively, delivering robust schema retrieval and selection performance. SPT also achieves comparable extraction performance to LoRA baselines and current leading UIE systems with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing approaches for Large language model (LLM) detoxification generally rely on training on large-scale non-toxic or human-annotated preference data, designing prompts to instruct the LLM to generate safe content, or modifying the model parameters to remove toxic information, which are computationally expensive, lack robustness, and often compromise LLMs' fluency and contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for LLM detoxification, which leverages a compact, pre-trained calibration model that guides the detoxification process of a target LLM via a lightweight intervention in its generation pipeline. By learning a detoxified embedding space from non-toxic data, the calibration model effectively steers the LLM away from generating harmful content. This approach only requires a one-time training of the calibration model that is able to be seamlessly applied to multiple LLMs without compromising fluency or contextual understanding. Experiment results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces toxicity while maintaining reasonable content expression.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) is an important yet not fully understood ability of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). It can greatly enhance task performance using a few examples, termed demonstrations, without fine-tuning. Although effective in question answering, ICL often underperforms in long-form generation tasks such as summarization. Under appropriately realistic assumptions, we empirically and theoretically show that ICL demonstrations alone are insufficient to teach LLMs the task language and format distributions for generation. We argue for explicit exposure to the task distributions and hypothesize that defining them by prompting enhances model performance. To this end, we present LongGuide, which efficiently generates two parallel streams of guidelines capturing task language and format properties: (i) Metric Guidelines (MGs) that instruct models to optimize self-evaluated metrics; and (ii) Output Constraint Guidelines (OCGs) that constrain generation at both token and sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the best combination of guidelines, improving both strong open- and closed-source LLMs by over 5% in both zero- and few-shot settings. We show that LongGuide is generalizable, learnable by weak models to enhance strong ones, and integrates synergistically with automatic prompt optimizers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized AI assistants, a hallmark of the human-like capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are a challenging application that intertwines multiple problems in LLM research. Despite the growing interest in the development of personalized assistants, the lack of an open-source conversational dataset tailored for personalization remains a significant obstacle for researchers in the field. To address this research gap, we introduce HiCUPID, a new benchmark to probe and unleash the potential of LLMs to deliver personalized responses. Alongside a conversational dataset, HiCUPID provides a Llama-3.2-based automated evaluation model whose assessment closely mirrors human preferences. We release our dataset, evaluation model, and code atthis https URL.

  _Yimin Du_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  FastText has established itself as a fundamental algorithm for learning word representations, demonstrating exceptional capability in handling out-of-vocabulary words through character-level n-gram embeddings. However, its hash-based bucketing mechanism introduces critical limitations for large-scale industrial deployment: hash collisions cause semantic drift, and memory requirements become prohibitively expensive when dealing with real-world vocabularies containing millions of terms. This paper presents a comprehensive memory optimization framework that fundamentally reimagines FastText's memory management through the integration of double-array trie (DA-trie) structures and mark-compact garbage collection principles. Our approach leverages the linguistic insight that n-grams sharing common prefixes or suffixes exhibit highly correlated embeddings due to co-occurrence patterns in natural language. By systematically identifying and merging semantically similar embeddings based on structural relationships, we achieve compression ratios of 4:1 to 10:1 while maintaining near-perfect embedding quality. The algorithm consists of four sophisticated phases: prefix trie construction with embedding mapping, prefix-based similarity compression, suffix-based similarity compression, and mark-compact memory reorganization. Comprehensive experiments on a 30-million Chinese vocabulary dataset demonstrate memory reduction from over 100GB to approximately 30GB with negligible performance degradation. Our industrial deployment results show significant cost reduction, faster loading times, and improved model reliability through the elimination of hash collision artifacts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowing which latent conditions lead to a particular outcome is useful for critically examining claims made about complex event outcomes. Identifying implied conditions and examining their influence on an outcome is challenging. We handle this by combining and augmenting annotations from two existing datasets consisting of goals and states, and explore the influence of conditions through our research questions and Condition-based Reasoning tasks. We examine open and closed LLMs of varying sizes and intent-alignment on our reasoning tasks and find that conditions are useful when not all context is available. Models differ widely in their ability to generate and identify outcome-variant conditions which affects their performance on outcome validation when conditions are used to replace missing context. Larger models like GPT-4o, are more cautious in such less constrained situations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system with millennia of accumulated clinical experience, playing a vital role in global healthcare-particularly across East Asia. However, the implicit reasoning, diverse textual forms, and lack of standardization in TCM pose major challenges for computational modeling and evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in processing natural language across diverse domains, including general medicine. Yet, their systematic evaluation in the TCM domain remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks either focus narrowly on factual question answering or lack domain-specific tasks and clinical realism. To fill this gap, we introduce MTCMB-a Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on TCM Knowledge, Reasoning, and Safety. Developed in collaboration with certified TCM experts, MTCMB comprises 12 sub-datasets spanning five major categories: knowledge QA, language understanding, diagnostic reasoning, prescription generation, and safety evaluation. The benchmark integrates real-world case records, national licensing exams, and classical texts, providing an authentic and comprehensive testbed for TCM-capable models. Preliminary results indicate that current LLMs perform well on foundational knowledge but fall short in clinical reasoning, prescription planning, and safety compliance. These findings highlight the urgent need for domain-aligned benchmarks like MTCMB to guide the development of more competent and trustworthy medical AI systems. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are publicly available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing 11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric. Checklist items for model outputs are then compared with corresponding items for reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded evaluation. We benchmark 11 large language models (LLMs) and analyze components in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer achieving only a 26.8% F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2) models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, though often not accurately; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable and low-cost usage.

  We introduce the $\underline{Ko}rean \underline{G}rammar \underline{E}valuation Bench\underline{M}ark (KoGEM)$, designed to assess the linguistic competence of LLMs and humans in Korean. KoGEM consists of 1.5k multiple-choice QA pairs covering five main categories and 16 subcategories. The zero-shot evaluation of 27 LLMs of various sizes and types reveals that while LLMs perform remarkably well on straightforward tasks requiring primarily definitional knowledge, they struggle with tasks that demand the integration of real-world experiential knowledge, such as phonological rules and pronunciation. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis suggests that incorporating such experiential knowledge could enhance the linguistic competence of LLMs. With KoGEM, we not only highlight the limitations of current LLMs in linguistic competence but also uncover hidden facets of LLMs in linguistic competence, paving the way for enhancing comprehensive language understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models increasingly gain popularity in real-world applications, processing extremely long contexts, often exceeding the model's pre-trained context limits, has emerged as a critical challenge. While existing approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second, it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves over 50% and 27% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH, demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally, REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving both efficiency and superior performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerating large language model (LLM) generation using a fast drafter while maintaining alignment with the target model's distribution. However, existing approaches face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their cross-model adaptability.

  Detecting ambiguity is important for language understanding, including uncertainty estimation, humour detection, and processing garden path sentences. We assess language models' sensitivity to ambiguity by introducing an adversarial ambiguity dataset that includes syntactic, lexical, and phonological ambiguities along with adversarial variations (e.g., word-order changes, synonym replacements, and random-based alterations). Our findings show that direct prompting fails to robustly identify ambiguity, while linear probes trained on model representations can decode ambiguity with high accuracy, sometimes exceeding 90\%. Our results offer insights into the prompting paradigm and how language models encode ambiguity at different layers. We release both our code and data:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse dictionary learning (and, in particular, sparse autoencoders) attempts to learn a set of human-understandable concepts that can explain variation on an abstract space. A basic limitation of this approach is that it neither exploits nor represents the semantic relationships between the learned concepts. In this paper, we introduce a modified SAE architecture that explicitly models a semantic hierarchy of concepts. Application of this architecture to the internal representations of large language models shows both that semantic hierarchy can be learned, and that doing so improves both reconstruction and interpretability. Additionally, the architecture leads to significant improvements in computational efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes, adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on cooperativity. This leaves a gap in systematic understanding of non-cooperative discourse. To address this, we introduce CoBRA (Cooperation-Breach Response Assessment), along with three interpretable metrics -- Benefit at Turn (BaT), Penalty at Turn (PaT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBaT) -- to quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present CHARM, an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts, introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with culturally-specific reasoning tasks, particularly in low-resource languages, hindering their global applicability. Addressing this gap is crucial for equitable AI deployment. We introduce Culturally-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (CG-CoT), a novel prompting strategy that combines dense vector retrieval of cultural context with explicit reasoning sequences. Our extensive experiments on Yoruba proverb interpretation demonstrate that CG-CoT provides significantly higher culturally-aligned accuracy and depth than traditional prompting methods, validated through both automated metrics and LLM-based evaluations. Notably, we uncover stark disparities between token-level translation metrics like BLEU and human-judged cultural relevance, suggesting a rethinking of evaluation approaches for low-resource NLP.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grounded text generation models often produce content that deviates from their source material, requiring user verification to ensure accuracy. Existing attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims. In contrast, existing sub-sentence attribution methods may be more precise but fail to align with users' interests. In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task, including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS) and Long-form Question Answering (LFQA). Our findings show that LAQuer methods significantly reduce the length of the attributed text. Our contributions include: (1) proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability, (2) suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines, and (3) proposing a new evaluation setting to promote future research on localized attribution in content-grounded generation.

  _Byung-Doh Oh, Hongao Zhu, William Schuler_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In psycholinguistic modeling, surprisal from larger pre-trained language models has been shown to be a poorer predictor of naturalistic human reading times. However, it has been speculated that this may be due to data leakage that caused language models to see the text stimuli during training. This paper presents two studies to address this concern at scale. The first study reveals relatively little leakage of five naturalistic reading time corpora in two pre-training datasets in terms of length and frequency of token $n$-gram overlap. The second study replicates the negative relationship between language model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on 'leakage-free' data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora. Taken together, this suggests that previous results using language models trained on these corpora are not driven by the effects of data leakage.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  System-generated logs are typically converted into categorical log templates through parsing. These templates are crucial for generating actionable insights in various downstream tasks. However, existing parsers often fail to capture fine-grained template details, leading to suboptimal accuracy and reduced utility in downstream tasks requiring precise pattern identification. We propose a character-level log parser utilizing a novel neural architecture that aggregates character embeddings. Our approach estimates a sequence of binary-coded decimals to achieve highly granular log templates extraction. Our low-resource character-level parser, tested on revised Loghub-2k and a manually annotated industrial dataset, matches LLM-based parsers in accuracy while outperforming semantic parsers in efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The pervasive deployment of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI systems has revolutionized information access, yet their propensity for generating factually unsupported or hallucinated responses remains a critical impediment to trustworthiness and widespread adoption. This paper introduces Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL), a novel hybrid training paradigm designed to imbue LLMs with the intrinsic capability to accurately detect unanswerable questions and generate reliably appropriate responses. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on external classifiers or simple prompting, RUL integrates a discriminative unanswerability prediction head with the LLM's generative core, guided by a multi-stage learning strategy. This includes supervised fine-tuning on a novel, richly annotated dataset, Enhanced-CAsT-Answerability (ECA), which features hierarchical answerability labels and ground-truth refusal responses. Crucially, RUL incorporates a subsequent reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase to refine the nuance, helpfulness, and informativeness of refusal responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate RUL's superior performance, achieving significantly higher accuracy in unanswerability detection across sentence, paragraph, and ranking levels, and substantially increasing the generation of appropriate refusals for unanswerable queries, alongside strong performance on answerable questions. Human evaluations further corroborate RUL's effectiveness, highlighting a marked improvement in perceived helpfulness and trustworthiness, ultimately paving the way for more reliable and user-centric conversational AI.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in tasks related to coreference resolution. However, previous studies mostly assessed LLM performance on coreference resolution with nouns and third person pronouns. This study evaluates LLM performance on coreference resolution with indexical like I, you, here and tomorrow, which come with unique challenges due to their linguistic properties. We present the first study examining how LLMs interpret indexicals in English, releasing the English Indexical Dataset with 1600 multiple-choice questions. We evaluate pioneering LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit an impressive performance with some indexicals (I), while struggling with others (you, here, tomorrow), and that syntactic cues (e.g. quotation) contribute to LLM performance with some indexicals, while they reduce performance with others.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers optimized for general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference time, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable "hypertokens" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant that trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We show that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to use hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by 20-60\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors: (1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3) LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors. On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally, while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA atthis http URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their internal mechanisms by linking neural representations to interpretable semantics. However, how neurons functionally co-activate with each other to give rise to emergent capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity topology of LLM neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By analyzing internal neural graphs across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural topology. This predictability is robust even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections or probing models after only 8 pretraining steps, highlighting the sparsity and early emergence of topological patterns. Further graph matching analysis suggests that, despite significant distinctions in architectures, parameters, and training data, different LLMs develop intricate and consistent neural topological structures that may form the foundation for their language generation abilities. Codes and data for the graph probing toolbox are released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

  Access to humanities research databases is often hindered by the limitations of traditional interaction formats, particularly in the methods of searching and response generation. This study introduces an LLM-based smart assistant designed to facilitate natural language communication with digital humanities data. The assistant, developed in a chatbot format, leverages the RAG approach and integrates state-of-the-art technologies such as hybrid search, automatic query generation, text-to-SQL filtering, semantic database search, and hyperlink insertion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, experiments were conducted to assess the response quality of various language models. The testing was based on the Prozhito digital archive, which contains diary entries from predominantly Russian-speaking individuals who lived in the 20th century. The chatbot is tailored to support anthropology and history researchers, as well as non-specialist users with an interest in the field, without requiring prior technical training. By enabling researchers to query complex databases with natural language, this tool aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency in humanities research. The study highlights the potential of Large Language Models to transform the way researchers and the public interact with digital archives, making them more intuitive and inclusive.

  Diary analysis presents challenges, particularly in extracting meaningful information from large corpora, where traditional methods often fail to deliver satisfactory results. This study introduces a novel method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and cluster the various purposes of diary writing. By "purposes," we refer to the intentions behind diary writing, such as documenting life events, self-reflection, or practicing language skills. Our approach is applied to Soviet-era diaries (1922-1929) from the Prozhito digital archive, a rich collection of personal narratives. We evaluate different proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that GPT-4o and o1-mini achieve the best performance, while a template-based baseline is significantly less effective. Additionally, we analyze the retrieved purposes based on gender, age of the authors, and the year of writing. Furthermore, we examine the types of errors made by the models, providing a deeper understanding of their limitations and potential areas for improvement in future research.

  This paper presents LEMONADE, a large-scale conflict event dataset comprising 39,786 events across 20 languages and 171 countries, with extensive coverage of region-specific entities. LEMONADE is based on a partially reannotated subset of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which has documented global conflict events for over a decade.To address the challenge of aggregating multilingual sources for global event analysis, we introduce abstractive event extraction (AEE) and its subtask, abstractive entity linking (AEL). Unlike conventional span-based event extraction, our approach detects event arguments and entities through holistic document understanding and normalizes them across the multilingual dataset. We evaluate various large language models (LLMs) on these tasks, adapt existing zero-shot event extraction systems, and benchmark supervised models. Additionally, we introduce ZEST, a novel zero-shot retrieval-based system for AEL.Our best zero-shot system achieves an end-to-end F1 score of 58.3%, with LLMs outperforming specialized event extraction models such as GoLLIE. For entity linking, ZEST achieves an F1 score of 45.7%, significantly surpassing OneNet, a state-of-the-art zero-shot baseline that achieves only 23.7%. However, these zero-shot results lag behind the best supervised systems by 20.1% and 37.0% in the end-to-end and AEL tasks, respectively, highlighting the need for further research.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content spanning ideological rhetoric to explicit instructions for violence. However, existing safety evaluations often rely on simplistic binary labels (safe and unsafe), overlooking the nuanced spectrum of risk these outputs pose. To address this, we present XGUARD, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the severity of extremist content generated by LLMs. XGUARD includes 3,840 red teaming prompts sourced from real world data such as social media and news, covering a broad range of ideologically charged scenarios. Our framework categorizes model responses into five danger levels (0 to 4), enabling a more nuanced analysis of both the frequency and severity of failures. We introduce the interpretable Attack Severity Curve (ASC) to visualize vulnerabilities and compare defense mechanisms across threat intensities. Using XGUARD, we evaluate six popular LLMs and two lightweight defense strategies, revealing key insights into current safety gaps and trade-offs between robustness and expressive freedom. Our work underscores the value of graded safety metrics for building trustworthy LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming valuable to corporate data management due to their ability to process text from various document formats and facilitate user interactions through natural language queries. However, LLMs must consider the sensitivity of information when communicating with employees, especially given access restrictions. Simple filtering based on user clearance levels can pose both performance and privacy challenges. To address this, we propose the concept of sensitivity awareness (SA), which enables LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. In addition, we developed a benchmarking environment called ACCESS DENIED INC to evaluate SA. Our experimental findings reveal significant variations in model behavior, particularly in managing unauthorized data requests while effectively addressing legitimate queries. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking sensitivity-aware language models and provides insights to enhance privacy-centric AI systems in corporate environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatically generating high-quality mathematical problems that align with educational objectives is a crucial task in NLP-based educational technology. Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex, multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing inspiration from teachers' problem design processes, we propose the Educational Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational mathematical question generation, following a "plan-evaluate-optimize" approach. Specifically, by combining planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models, we continuously optimize questions through iterative feedback. This self-optimization mechanism ensures that the generated questions both fit the educational context and strategically achieve specific basic educational objectives. Through extensive experiments based on EQGEVAL, we have demonstrated that EQPR achieves significant improvements in generating questions that meet multi-dimensional educational objectives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sarcasm fundamentally alters meaning through tone and context, yet detecting it in speech remains a challenge due to data scarcity. In addition, existing detection systems often rely on multimodal data, limiting their applicability in contexts where only speech is available. To address this, we propose an annotation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a sarcasm dataset. Using a publicly available sarcasm-focused podcast, we employ GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 for initial sarcasm annotations, followed by human verification to resolve disagreements. We validate this approach by comparing annotation quality and detection performance on a publicly available sarcasm dataset using a collaborative gating architecture. Finally, we introduce PodSarc, a large-scale sarcastic speech dataset created through this pipeline. The detection model achieves a 73.63% F1 score, demonstrating the dataset's potential as a benchmark for sarcasm detection research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compositionality is a key aspect of human intelligence, essential for reasoning and generalization. While transformer-based models have become the de facto standard for many language modeling tasks, little is known about how they represent compound words, and whether these representations are compositional. In this study, we test compositionality in Mistral, OpenAI Large, and Google embedding models, and compare them with BERT. First, we evaluate compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality. Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent adjective-noun compositions. Overall, we present a thorough investigation of compositionality.

Existing prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular, Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program following the guidance of each Pythonthis http URLfinal SQL program matches the reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performingthis http URLexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs exhibit promising Social Intelligence (SI) in modeling human behavior, raising the need to evaluate LLMs' SI and their discrepancy with humans. SI equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave wisely in navigating social interactions to achieve social goals. This presents an operational evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation and process-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation, which existing work fails to address. To this end, we propose SocialEval, a script-based bilingual SI benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure. Analysis of LLMs' formed representation space and neuronal activations reveals that LLMs have developed ability-specific functional partitions akin to the human brain.

  Affordance theory posits that environments inherently offer action possibilities that shape perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs. Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models, such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware interactions.

  The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) has led to a wide range of MLLM applications, and a number of benchmark datasets have sprung up in order to assess MLLM abilities. However, full-coverage Q&A testing on large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small number of questions and answers.

  _Yixin Wan, Anil Ramakrishna, Kai-Wei Chang, Volkan Cevher, Rahul Gupta_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning has recently gained significant attention, driven by the need to remove unwanted information, such as private, sensitive, or copyrighted content, from LLMs. However, conventional unlearning approaches indiscriminately update model parameters to forget all tokens in a target document, including common tokens (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, general nouns) that carry general knowledge. In this paper, we highlight that not every token needs forgetting. We propose Selective Unlearning (SU), which identifies a critical subset of tokens within the forgetting set that is relevant to the unwanted information, and unlearns only those tokens. Experiments on two benchmarks and six baseline unlearning algorithms demonstrate that SU not only achieves effective unlearning on the targeted forget data, but also significantly preserves the model's utility in the retaining set.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current large language models (LLMs) often exhibit imbalanced multilingual capabilities due to their English-centric training corpora. To address this, existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations. Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the impressive performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on downstream tasks, their ability to understand and reason about causal relationships in visual inputs remains unclear. Robust causal reasoning is fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal that while VLMs excel in object and activity recognition, they perform poorly on causal reasoning tasks, often only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further analysis suggests that this limitation stems from a severe lack of causal expressions in widely used training datasets, where causal relationships are rarely explicitly conveyed. We additionally explore fine-tuning strategies with hard negative cases, showing that targeted fine-tuning can improve model's causal reasoning while maintaining generalization and downstream performance. Our study highlights a key gap in current VLMs and lays the groundwork for future work on causal understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt. GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union, Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models, BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bidirectional language models have better context understanding and perform better than unidirectional models on natural language understanding tasks, yet the theoretical reasons behind this advantage remain unclear. In this work, we investigate this disparity through the lens of the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which formalizes a trade-off between compressing input information and preserving task-relevant content. We propose FlowNIB, a dynamic and scalable method for estimating mutual information during training that addresses key limitations of classical IB approaches, including computational intractability and fixed trade-off schedules. Theoretically, we show that bidirectional models retain more mutual information and exhibit higher effective dimensionality than unidirectional models. To support this, we present a generalized framework for measuring representational complexity and prove that bidirectional representations are strictly more informative under mild conditions. We further validate our findings through extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks using FlowNIB, revealing how information is encoded and compressed throughout training. Together, our work provides a principled explanation for the effectiveness of bidirectional architectures and introduces a practical tool for analyzing information flow in deep language models.

  Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to 17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward structured knowledge expertise.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios, particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs) by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive datasets that encapsulate substantial world knowledge. However, their outputs often include confidently stated inaccuracies. Earlier works suggest that LLMs encode truthfulness as a distinct linear feature, termed the "truth direction", which can classify truthfulness reliably. We address several open questions about the truth direction: (i) whether LLMs universally exhibit consistent truth directions; (ii) whether sophisticated probing techniques are necessary to identify truth directions; and (iii) how the truth direction generalizes across diverse contexts. Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable models, particularly in the context of logical negation. Additionally, we demonstrate that truthfulness probes trained on declarative atomic statements can generalize effectively to logical transformations, question-answering tasks, in-context learning, and external knowledge sources. Finally, we explore the practical application of truthfulness probes in selective question-answering, illustrating their potential to improve user trust in LLM outputs. These results advance our understanding of truth directions and provide new insights into the internal representations of LLM beliefs. Our code is public atthis https URL

  Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a \weight token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances, ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models. Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing. Extensive experiments on diverse LLMs demonstrate that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing methods while achieving superior editing efficiency. Further analysis confirms its adaptability and stability in multi-model editing scenarios. Our code will be available.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language generation, including creative tasks like poetry composition. However, most progress remains concentrated in high-resource languages. This raises an important question: Can LLMs be adapted for structured poetic generation in a low-resource, morphologically rich language such as Sanskrit? In this work, we introduce a dataset designed for translating English prose into structured Sanskrit verse, with strict adherence to classical metrical patterns, particularly the Anushtub meter. We evaluate a range of generative models-both open-source and proprietary-under multiple settings. Specifically, we explore constrained decoding strategies and instruction-based fine-tuning tailored to metrical and semantic fidelity. Our decoding approach achieves over 99% accuracy in producing syntactically valid poetic forms, substantially outperforming general-purpose models in meter conformity. Meanwhile, instruction-tuned variants show improved alignment with source meaning and poetic style, as supported by human assessments, albeit with marginal trade-offs in metrical precision.

  We propose GuessBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on modeling the pervasive, noisy, and pluralistic human creativity. GuessBench sources data from "Guess the Build", an online multiplayer Minecraft minigame where one player constructs a Minecraft build given a concept (e.g. caterpillar) and others try to guess it with natural language hints, presenting a pristine testbed for sensemaking creativity in the wild with VLMs acting as guessers. We curate 1500 images from the actual gameplay and design 2000 problems spanning static and dynamic image settings, natural language hints of varying completeness, and more. Extensive experiments with six open/API VLMs and five reasoning enhancement approaches demonstrate that GuessBench presents a uniquely challenging task in creativity modeling: even the start-of-the-art GPT-4o is incorrect on 34% of instances, while we observe a huge performance gap (13.87% vs. 53.93% on average) between open and API models. When used as a resource to improve VLMs, fine-tuning on the reasoning traces for GuessBench problems improves visual perception tasks by 15.36% on average. Further analysis reveals that VLM performance in creativity sensemaking correlates with the frequency of the concept in training data, while the accuracy drops sharply for concepts in underrepresented cultural contexts and low-resource languages.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with complex reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering (VQA). While current methods have advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important, and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory, which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient zero-shot reasoning. For more complex tasks, it employs the conceptualizing before observation strategy to highlight critical elements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks, ScienceQA, TextQA, VizWiz, and MME, demonstrate that FOCUS consistently improves the performance of both open-source and black-box MLLMs, achieving significant gains across all datasets. Ablation studies further validate the importance of combining diverse cognitive strategies with refined visual information for superior performance. Code will be released.

We introduce Retrieval-Aware Robustness Evaluation (RARE), a unified framework and large-scale benchmark that jointly stress-tests query and document perturbations over dynamic, time-sensitive corpora. One of the central features of RARE is a knowledge-graph-driven synthesis pipeline (RARE-Get) that automatically extracts single and multi-hop relations from the customized corpus and generates multi-level question sets without manual intervention. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct a dataset (RARE-Set) spanning 400 expert-level time-sensitive finance, economics, and policy documents and 48,322 questions whose distribution evolves as the underlying sources change. To quantify resilience, we formalize retrieval-conditioned robustness metrics (RARE-Met) that capture a model's ability to remain correct or recover when queries, documents, or real-world retrieval results are systematically altered. Our results show that RAG systems exhibit surprising vulnerability to perturbations, with document robustness consistently being the weakest point regardless of generator size or architecture. RAG systems consistently show lower robustness on multi-hop queries than single-hop queries across all domains.

  Improving cultural competence of language technologies is important. However most recent works rarely engage with the communities they study, and instead rely on synthetic setups and imperfect proxies of culture. In this work, we take a human-centered approach to discover and measure language-based cultural norms, and cultural competence of LLMs. We focus on a single kind of culture, research cultures, and a single task, adapting writing across research cultures. Through a set of interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, who are experts at moving between cultures, we create a framework of structural, stylistic, rhetorical, and citational norms that vary across research cultures. We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and their tendency to homogenise writing. Overall, our work illustrates the efficacy of a human-centered approach to measuring cultural norms in human-written and LLM-generated texts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

  _Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Israt Jahan, Elham Dolatabadi, Chun Peng, Enamul Hoque, Jimmy Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in biomedical relation extraction, even in zero-shot scenarios. However, evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications. This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly because relations extracted by LLMs do not adhere to any standard format. To address this, we propose structured output formatting for LLM-generated responses that helps LLM-Judges to improve their performance by about 15% (on average). We also introduce a domain adaptation technique to further enhance LLM-Judge performance by effectively transferring knowledge between datasets. We release both our human-annotated and LLM-annotated judgment data (36k samples in total) for public use here:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately read and comprehend extremely long texts. Current methods for improvement typically rely on splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains robustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to 256k tokens. Our datasets and code are available at the following link:this https URL

  _Wenshuo Dong, Qingsong Yang, Shu Yang, Lijie Hu, Meng Ding, Wanyu Lin, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive data capture rich information embedded in the training data. However, this also introduces the risk of privacy leakage, particularly involving personally identifiable information (PII). Although previous studies have shown that this risk can be mitigated through methods such as privacy neurons, they all assume that both the (sensitive) training data and user queries are in English. We show that they cannot defend against the privacy leakage in cross-lingual contexts: even if the training data is exclusively in one language, these (private) models may still reveal private information when queried in another language. In this work, we first investigate the information flow of cross-lingual privacy leakage to give a better understanding. We find that LLMs process private information in the middle layers, where representations are largely shared across languages. The risk of leakage peaks when converted to a language-specific space in later layers. Based on this, we identify privacy-universal neurons and language-specific privacy neurons. Privacy-universal neurons influence privacy leakage across all languages, while language-specific privacy neurons are only related to specific languages. By deactivating these neurons, the cross-lingual privacy leakage risk is reduced by 23.3%-31.6%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Data Swarms, an algorithm to optimize the generation of synthetic evaluation data and advance quantitative desiderata of LLM evaluation. We first train a swarm of initial data generators using existing data, and define various evaluation objectives to reflect the desired properties of evaluation (e.g., generate more difficult problems for the evaluated models) and quantitatively evaluate data generators. We then employ particle swarm optimization to optimize the swarm of data generators, where they collaboratively search through the model parameter space to find new generators that advance these objectives. We further extend it to Adversarial Swarms, where the data generator swarm generates harder data while the test taker model swarm learns from such data, co-evolving dynamically for better data and models simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Data Swarms outperforms eight data generation baselines across five evaluation objectives, while Adversarial Swarms produce more robust learning of synthetic data and stronger generalization. Further analysis reveals that Data Swarms successfully optimizes compositions of multiple evaluation objectives and generalizes to new off-the-shelf LLMs, unseen at optimization time.

  Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive capabilities in human language comprehension and reasoning, yet their potential in cybersecurity remains underexplored. We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons.

  Narrative frames are a powerful way of conceptualizing and communicating complex, controversial ideas, however automated frame analysis to date has mostly overlooked this framing device. In this paper, we connect elements of narrativity with fundamental aspects of framing, and present a framework which formalizes and operationalizes such aspects. We annotate and release a data set of news articles in the climate change domain, analyze the dominance of narrative frame components across political leanings, and test LLMs in their ability to predict narrative frames and their components. Finally, we apply our framework in an unsupervised way to elicit components of narrative framing in a second domain, the COVID-19 crisis, where our predictions are congruent with prior theoretical work showing the generalizability of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a gradient-informed fine-tuning method for large language models under few-shot conditions. The goal is to enhance task adaptability and training stability when data is limited. The method builds on a base loss function and introduces two gradient-related regularization terms. The first enforces gradient direction consistency to guide parameter updates along task-relevant directions and prevent drift. The second controls gradient magnitude to avoid abnormal updates. Together, these components support a more efficient and stable optimization path. To further improve cross-task generalization, the method incorporates a gradient alignment mechanism. This mechanism measures the consistency between optimization directions of the source and target tasks. It enhances fine-tuning performance in multi-task and cross-domain scenarios. Across various natural language understanding tasks, the method outperforms existing fine-tuning strategies in average accuracy, gradient stability, and directional alignment. Empirical evaluations under different sample sizes and domain-specific tasks confirm the method's robustness and broad applicability in low-resource environments. In particular, the method shows clear advantages in controlling parameter update paths. The results demonstrate that a gradient-based fine-tuning framework can effectively leverage the representational power of large language models. It ensures training stability while reducing dependence on large volumes of labeled data.

  _Debarati Bhattacharjee, Ashish Anand_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features. We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference over arguments and the relations between them.

  _Li Zhang, Morgan Gray, Jaromir Savelka, Kevin D. Ashley_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3) recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test 3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors, highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings.

  Malicious attackers can exploit large language models (LLMs) by engaging them in multi-turn dialogues to achieve harmful objectives, posing significant safety risks to society. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defense mechanism: SafeTy Reasoning Elicitation Alignment for Multi-Turn Dialogues (STREAM). STREAM defends LLMs against multi-turn attacks while preserving their functional capabilities. Our approach involves constructing a human-annotated dataset, the Safety Reasoning Multi-turn Dialogues dataset, which is used to fine-tune a plug-and-play safety reasoning moderator. This model is designed to identify malicious intent hidden within multi-turn conversations and alert the target LLM of potential risks. We evaluate STREAM across multiple LLMs against prevalent multi-turn attack strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing defense techniques, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 51.2%, all while maintaining comparable LLM capability.

  Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating, brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting, outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than zero-shot prompting.

  Information Extraction (IE) systems are traditionally domain-specific, requiring costly adaptation that involves expert schema design, data annotation, and model training. While Large Language Models have shown promise in zero-shot IE, performance degrades significantly in unseen domains where label definitions differ. This paper introduces GUIDEX, a novel method that automatically defines domain-specific schemas, infers guidelines, and generates synthetically labeled instances, allowing for better out-of-domain generalization. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 with GUIDEX sets a new state-of-the-art across seven zeroshot Named Entity Recognition benchmarks. Models trained with GUIDEX gain up to 7 F1 points over previous methods without humanlabeled data, and nearly 2 F1 points higher when combined with it. Models trained on GUIDEX demonstrate enhanced comprehension of complex, domain-specific annotation schemas. Code, models, and synthetic datasets are available atthis http URL

  Stuttering is a complex disorder that requires specialized expertise for effective assessment and treatment. This paper presents an effort to enhance the FluencyBank dataset with a new stuttering annotation scheme based on established clinical standards. To achieve high-quality annotations, we hired expert clinicians to label the data, ensuring that the resulting annotations mirror real-world clinical expertise. The annotations are multi-modal, incorporating audiovisual features for the detection and classification of stuttering moments, secondary behaviors, and tension scores. In addition to individual annotations, we additionally provide a test set with highly reliable annotations based on expert consensus for assessing individual annotators and machine learning models. Our experiments and analysis illustrate the complexity of this task that necessitates extensive clinical expertise for valid training and evaluation of stuttering assessment models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored. We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges: selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in realistic, multi-answer applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics. Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

  Toxic speech on online platforms is a growing concern, impacting user experience and online safety. While text-based toxicity detection is well-studied, audio-based approaches remain underexplored, especially for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. This paper introduces ViToSA (Vietnamese Toxic Spans Audio), the first dataset for toxic spans detection in Vietnamese speech, comprising 11,000 audio samples (25 hours) with accurate human-annotated transcripts. We propose a pipeline that combines ASR and toxic spans detection for fine-grained identification of toxic content. Our experiments show that fine-tuning ASR models on ViToSA significantly reduces WER when transcribing toxic speech, while the text-based toxic spans detection (TSD) models outperform existing baselines. These findings establish a novel benchmark for Vietnamese audio-based toxic spans detection, paving the way for future research in speech content moderation.

  Rental listings offer a unique window into how urban space is socially constructed through language. We analyze Chicago Craigslist rental advertisements from 2018 to 2024 to examine how listing agents characterize neighborhoods, identifying mismatches between institutional boundaries and neighborhood claims. Through manual and large language model annotation, we classify unstructured listings from Craigslist according to their neighborhood. Geospatial analysis reveals three distinct patterns: properties with conflicting neighborhood designations due to competing spatial definitions, border properties with valid claims to adjacent neighborhoods, and ``reputation laundering" where listings claim association with distant, desirable neighborhoods. Through topic modeling, we identify patterns that correlate with spatial positioning: listings further from neighborhood centers emphasize different amenities than centrally-located units. Our findings demonstrate that natural language processing techniques can reveal how definitions of urban spaces are contested in ways that traditional methods overlook.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prior research indicates that LID model performance significantly declines on accented speech; however, the specific causes, extent, and characterization of these errors remain under-explored. (i) We identify a common failure mode on accented speech whereby LID systems often misclassify L2 accented speech as the speaker's native language or a related language. (ii) We present evidence suggesting that state-of-the-art models are invariant to permutations of short spans of speech, implying they classify on the basis of short phonotactic features indicative of accent rather than language. Our analysis reveals a simple method to enhance model robustness to accents through input chunking. (iii) We present an approach that integrates sequence-level information into our model without relying on monolingual ASR systems; this reduces accent-language confusion and significantly enhances performance on accented speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Clinical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment require strong decision-making abilities, highlighting the importance of rigorous evaluation benchmarks to assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a knowledge-guided data augmentation framework that enhances the difficulty of clinical multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets by generating distractors (i.e., incorrect choices that are similar to the correct one and may confuse existing LLMs). Using our KG-based pipeline, the generated choices are both clinically plausible and deliberately misleading. Our approach involves multi-step, semantically informed walks on a medical knowledge graph to identify distractor paths-associations that are medically relevant but factually incorrect-which then guide the LLM in crafting more deceptive distractors. We apply the designed knowledge graph guided distractor generation (KGGDG) pipline, to six widely used medical QA benchmarks and show that it consistently reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs. These findings establish KGGDG as a powerful tool for enabling more robust and diagnostic evaluations of medical LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contract review is a complex and time-intensive task that typically demands specialized legal expertise, rendering it largely inaccessible to non-experts. Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives. To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source, end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component, enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable, and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A retriever, which retrieves relevant knowledge pieces from a knowledge base given a context, is an important component in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Retrievers have been introduced in knowledge-grounded dialog systems to improve knowledge acquisition. In knowledge-grounded dialog systems, when conditioning on a given context, there may be multiple relevant and correlated knowledge pieces. However, knowledge pieces are usually assumed to be conditionally independent in current retriever models. To address this issue, we propose Entriever, an energy-based retriever. Entriever directly models the candidate retrieval results as a whole instead of modeling the knowledge pieces separately, with the relevance score defined by an energy function. We explore various architectures of energy functions and different training methods for Entriever, and show that Entriever substantially outperforms the strong cross-encoder baseline in knowledge retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we show that in semi-supervised training of knowledge-grounded dialog systems, Entriever enables effective scoring of retrieved knowledge pieces and significantly improves end-to-end performance of dialog systems.

  Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents (CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios, to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges: dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues, enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual, demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in psychological counseling compared to existing baselines.

  Evaluation frameworks for text summarization have evolved in terms of both domain coverage and metrics. However, existing benchmarks still lack domain-specific assessment criteria, remain predominantly English-centric, and face challenges with human annotation due to the complexity of reasoning. To address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional, multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across domains and languages. We further examine large language models as summary evaluators, analyzing the correlation between their evaluation and summarization capabilities, and uncovering systematic bias in their assessment of self-generated summaries. Our benchmark dataset is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens, resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance, hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks, consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.

  Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update Large Language Models (LLMs) by modifying specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. Among knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving model parameters unchanged. However, existing ICE approaches do not explicitly separate the newly injected knowledge from the model's original reasoning process. This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of the reasoningthis http URLthis work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end, we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property (IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental results on a Taiwan patent Q&A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid, cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit knowledge disparities across languages. Encouraging LLMs to \textit{abstain} when faced with knowledge gaps is a promising strategy to reduce hallucinations in multilingual settings. Current abstention strategies for multilingual scenarios primarily rely on generating feedback in various languages using LLMs and performing self-reflection. However, these methods can be adversely impacted by inaccuracies and biases in the generated feedback. To address this, from a causal perspective, we introduce \textit{CausalAbstain}, a method that helps LLMs determine whether to utilize multiple generated feedback responses and how to identify the most useful ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{CausalAbstain} effectively selects helpful feedback and enhances abstention decisions with interpretability in both native language (\textsc{Casual-native}) and multilingual (\textsc{Causal-multi}) settings, outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets covering encyclopedic and commonsense knowledge QA tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In commonsense generation, given a set of input concepts, a model must generate a response that is not only commonsense bearing, but also capturing multiple diverse viewpoints. Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation metrics. Our experimental results show that content-based diversity evaluation metrics consistently outperform the form-based counterparts, showing high correlations with the LLM-based ratings. We recommend that future work on commonsense generation should use content-based metrics for evaluating the diversity of their outputs.

  Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have demonstrated strong advantages in addressing complex real-world tasks. However, due to the introduction of additional attack surfaces, MASs are particularly vulnerable to misinformation injection. To facilitate a deeper understanding of misinformation propagation dynamics within these systems, we introduce MisinfoTask, a novel dataset featuring complex, realistic tasks designed to evaluate MAS robustness against such threats. Building upon this, we propose ARGUS, a two-stage, training-free defense framework leveraging goal-aware reasoning for precise misinformation rectification within information flows. Our experiments demonstrate that in challenging misinformation scenarios, ARGUS exhibits significant efficacy across various injection attacks, achieving an average reduction in misinformation toxicity of approximately 28.17% and improving task success rates under attack by approximately 10.33%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various tasks, leveraging their exceptional in-context learning ability with only a few examples. Accordingly, the selection of optimal in-context examples has been actively studied in the field of machine translation. However, these studies presuppose the presence of a demonstration pool with human-annotated pairs, making them less applicable to low-resource languages where such an assumption is challenging to meet. To overcome this limitation, this paper explores the research direction of in-context example generation for machine translation. Specifically, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for Translation (DAT), a simple yet effective approach that generates example pairs without relying on any external resources. This method builds upon two prior criteria, relevance and diversity, which have been highlighted in previous work as key factors for in-context example selection. Through experiments and analysis on low-resource languages where human-annotated pairs are scarce, we show that DAT achieves superior translation quality compared to the baselines. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of progressively accumulating generated pairs during test time to build and reuse a demonstration pool. Our implementation is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist multimodal fake news detection by predicting pseudo labels. However, LLM-generated pseudo labels alone demonstrate poor performance compared to traditional detection methods, making their effective integration non-trivial. In this paper, we propose Global Label Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not propagate their own labels back to themselves. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that by synergizing LLMs with label propagation, our model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

We introduce Auto-Patch, a novel method that dynamically patches hidden states during inference to enhance multi-hop reasoning in LLMs. Building on the PatchScopes framework, Auto-Patch selectively modifies internal representations using a learned classifier. Evaluated on the MuSiQue dataset, Auto-Patch improves the solve rate from 18.45\% (baseline) to 23.63~$\pm$~0.7\% (3 runs), narrowing the gap to Chain-of-Thought prompting (27.44\%).

  Visual persuasion, which uses visual elements to influence cognition and behaviors, is crucial in fields such as advertising and political communication. With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, there is growing potential to develop persuasive systems that automatically generate persuasive images tailored to individuals. However, a significant bottleneck in this area is the lack of comprehensive datasets that connect the persuasiveness of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images. To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset, comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and psychological characteristics (personality traits and values). We demonstrate the utility of our dataset by developing a persuasive image generator and an automated evaluator, and establish benchmark baselines. Our experiments reveal that incorporating psychological characteristics enhances the generation and evaluation of persuasive images, providing valuable insights for personalized visual persuasion.

  This paper investigates a critical design decision in the practice of massively multilingual continual pre-training -- the inclusion of parallel data. Specifically, we study the impact of bilingual translation data for massively multilingual language adaptation of the Llama3 family of models to 500 languages. To this end, we construct the MaLA bilingual translation corpus, containing data from more than 2,500 language pairs. Subsequently, we develop the EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite of four massively multilingual models -- continually pre-trained from the Llama 3 family of base models extensively on diverse data mixes up to 671B tokens -- and explore the effect of continual pre-training with or without bilingual translation data. Comprehensive evaluation across 7 tasks and 12 benchmarks demonstrates that bilingual data tends to enhance language transfer and performance, particularly for low-resource languages. We open-source the MaLA corpus, EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite artefacts, code, and model generations.

  Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during summarization of patient-clinician dialogues pose significant risks to patient care and clinical decision-making. However, the phenomenon remains understudied in the clinical domain, with uncertainty surrounding the applicability of general-domain hallucination detectors. The rarity and randomness of hallucinations further complicate their investigation. In this paper, we conduct an evaluation of hallucination detection methods in the medical domain, and construct two datasets for the purpose: A fact-controlled Leave-N-out dataset -- generated by systematically removing facts from source dialogues to induce hallucinated content in summaries; and a natural hallucination dataset -- arising organically during LLM-based medical summarization. We show that general-domain detectors struggle to detect clinical hallucinations, and that performance on fact-controlled hallucinations does not reliably predict effectiveness on natural hallucinations. We then develop fact-based approaches that count hallucinations, offering explainability not available with existing methods. Notably, our LLM-based detectors, which we developed using fact-controlled hallucinations, generalize well to detecting real-world clinical hallucinations. This research contributes a suite of specialized metrics supported by expert-annotated datasets to advance faithful clinical summarization systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Forecasting over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) which predicts future facts based on historical ones has received much attention. Recent studies have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models' generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1) general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage, we mask the scenario information in different TKGs and convert it into anonymous temporal structures. After training on these structures, the model is able to capture the general patterns across different TKGs. In the specific learning stage, we inject the scenario information into the structures via either in-context learning or fine-tuning modes. Experimental results show that G2S effectively improves the generalization abilities of LLMs.

  Multi-answer question answering (QA), where questions can have many valid answers, presents a significant challenge for existing retrieval-augmented generation-based QA systems, as these systems struggle to retrieve and then synthesize a large number of evidence passages. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new multi-answer QA framework -- Retrieval-augmented Independent Reading with Inter-passage Verification (RI$^2$VER). Our framework retrieves a large set of passages and processes each passage individually to generate an initial high-recall but noisy answer set. Then we propose a new inter-passage verification pipeline that validates every candidate answer through (1) Verification Question Generation, (2) Gathering Additional Evidence, and (3) Verification with inter-passage synthesis. Evaluations on the QAMPARI and RoMQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines across various model sizes, achieving an average F1 score improvement of 11.17%. Further analysis validates that our inter-passage verification pipeline enables our framework to be particularly beneficial for questions requiring multi-evidence synthesis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contextual biasing (CB) improves automatic speech recognition for rare and unseen phrases. Recent studies have introduced dynamic vocabulary, which represents context phrases as expandable tokens in autoregressive (AR) models. This method improves CB accuracy but with slow inference speed. While dynamic vocabulary can be applied to non-autoregressive (NAR) models, such as connectionist temporal classification (CTC), the conditional independence assumption fails to capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens. This paper proposes DYNAC (Dynamic Vocabulary-based NAR Contextualization), a self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into intermediate layers. Conditioning the encoder on dynamic vocabulary, DYNAC effectively captures dependencies between static and dynamic tokens while reducing the real-time factor (RTF). Experimental results show that DYNAC reduces RTF by 81% with a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions, multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset, Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model, trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In context learning (ICL) relies heavily on high quality demonstrations drawn from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are extremely high.

  As prompts play an increasingly critical role in large language models (LLMs), optimizing textual prompts has become a crucial challenge. The Textual Gradient Descent (TGD) framework has emerged as a promising data-driven approach that iteratively refines textual prompts using LLM - suggested updates (or textual gradients) over minibatches of training samples. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that scaling the number of training examples initially improves but later degrades TGD's performance across multiple downstream NLP tasks. However, while data scaling improves results for most tasks, it also significantly increases the computational cost when leveraging LLMs. To address this, we draw inspiration from numerical gradient descent and propose Textual Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) - a method that facilitates scalable in-context learning by reweighting prompt sampling based on past batch distributions. Across nine NLP tasks spanning three domains - including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks - TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines that do not incorporate reweighted sampling, while also reducing variance in most tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for handling intricate tasks. However, existing approaches prioritize performance but often overlook the balance between effectiveness and computational cost. To address this, we first introduce the 3E Criteria to systematically assess the cost-effectiveness of search strategies, revealing that existing methods often trade significant efficiency for marginal performance gains. To improve LLM decision-making while maintaining efficiency, we propose the Speculative Reward Model (SRM), a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates with existing search strategies. Specifically, SRM employs an external reward assigner to predict optimal actions, reducing reliance on LLMs' internal self-evaluation. And a speculative verification mechanism is used to prune suboptimal choices and guide the search toward more promising steps. We evaluate SRM on several complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and numerical reasoning in specialized domains. Experimental results show that SRM reduces costs to 1/10 of the original search framework on average while maintaining effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current self-correction approaches in text-to-SQL face two critical limitations: 1) Conventional self-correction methods rely on recursive self-calls of LLMs, resulting in multiplicative computational overhead, and 2) LLMs struggle to implement effective error detection and correction for declarative SQL queries, as they fail to demonstrate the underlying reasoning path. In this work, we propose SHARE, an SLM-based Hierarchical Action corREction assistant that enables LLMs to perform more precise error localization and efficient correction. SHARE orchestrates three specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) in a sequential pipeline, where it first transforms declarative SQL queries into stepwise action trajectories that reveal underlying reasoning, followed by a two-phase granular refinement. We further propose a novel hierarchical self-evolution strategy for data-efficient training. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARE effectively enhances self-correction capabilities while proving robust across various LLMs. Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis shows that SHARE maintains strong performance even in low-resource training settings, which is particularly valuable for text-to-SQL applications with data privacy constraints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling test-time computation--generating and analyzing multiple or sequential outputs for a single input--has become a promising strategy for improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by advances in uncertainty quantification and multi-step reasoning. A key shared component is semantic clustering, which groups outputs that differ in form but convey the same meaning. Semantic clustering enables estimation of the distribution over the semantics of outputs and helps avoid redundant exploration of reasoning paths. However, existing approaches typically rely on external models, which introduce substantial computational overhead and often fail to capture context-aware semantics. We propose Latent Semantic Clustering (LSC), a lightweight and context-sensitive method that leverages the generator LLM's internal hidden states for clustering, eliminating the need for external models. Our extensive experiment across various LLMs and datasets shows that LSC significantly improves the computational efficiency of test-time scaling while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Datasets used for emotion recognition tasks typically contain overt cues that can be used in predicting the emotions expressed in a text. However, one challenge is that texts sometimes contain covert contextual cues that are rich in affective semantics, which warrant higher-order reasoning abilities to infer emotional states, not simply the emotions conveyed. This study advances beyond surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models (LLMs) reason about others' emotional states using contextual information, within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. Grounded in Cognitive Appraisal Theory, we curate a specialized ToM evaluation dataset1 to assess both forward reasoning - from context to emotion- and backward reasoning - from emotion to inferred context. We showed that LLMs can reason to a certain extent, although they are poor at associating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific emotions. Our work highlights the need for psychological theories in the training and evaluation of LLMs in the context of emotion reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In real practice, questions are typically complex and knowledge-intensive, requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize the multifaceted nature of the question and reason across multiple information sources. Iterative and adaptive retrieval, where LLMs decide when and what to retrieve based on their reasoning, has been shown to be a promising approach to resolve complex, knowledge-intensive questions. However, the performance of such retrieval frameworks is limited by the accumulation of reasoning errors and misaligned retrieval results. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeRare (Syntax Tree-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning), a framework that utilizes syntax trees to guide information retrieval and reasoning for question answering. Following the principle of compositionality, TreeRare traverses the syntax tree in a bottom-up fashion, and in each node, it generates subcomponent-based queries and retrieves relevant passages to resolve localized uncertainty. A subcomponent question answering module then synthesizes these passages into concise, context-aware evidence. Finally, TreeRare aggregates the evidence across the tree to form a final answer. Experiments across five question answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning demonstrate that TreeRare achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As language models evolve to tackle complex, multifaceted tasks, their evaluation must adapt to capture this intricacy. A granular, skill-specific understanding of model capabilities can empower researchers to make informed model development plans. In this paper, we introduce SkillVerse, an unsupervised tree-structured diagnosis framework for understanding model proficiency in specific abilities. With LLM as a judge, SkillVerse first critiques the model responses, and then organizes them into a hierarchical structure termed dendrogram. Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1) improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without SkillVerse.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have been prominent in various tasks, including text generation and summarisation. The applicability of LLMs to the generation of product reviews is gaining momentum, paving the way for the generation of movie reviews. In this study, we propose a framework that generates movie reviews using three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0), and evaluate their performance by comparing the generated outputs with IMDb user reviews. We use movie subtitles and screenplays as input to the LLMs and investigate how they affect the quality of reviews generated. We review the LLM-based movie reviews in terms of vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic consistency in comparison to IMDB user reviews. The results demonstrate that LLMs are capable of generating syntactically fluent and structurally complete movie reviews. Nevertheless, there is still a noticeable gap in emotional richness and stylistic coherence between LLM-generated and IMDb reviews, suggesting that further refinement is needed to improve the overall quality of movie review generation. We provided a survey-based analysis where participants were told to distinguish between LLM and IMDb user reviews. The results show that LLM-generated reviews are difficult to distinguish from IMDB user reviews. We found that DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, closely matching IMDb reviews. GPT-4o overemphasised positive emotions, while Gemini-2.0 captured negative emotions better but showed excessive emotional intensity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\% and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would likely erase the gap entirely.

  _Payal Mohapatra, Akash Pandey, Xiaoyuan Zhang, Qi Zhu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unvoiced electromyography (EMG) is an effective communication tool for individuals unable to produce vocal speech. However, most prior methods rely on paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for EMG-to-text conversion, which is not practical for such individuals. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that maps EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error rate (WER) of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown to be extendable to new language modalities -- such as audio -- understanding articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG remains more challenging. This work takes a crucial first step toward enabling LLMs to comprehend unvoiced speech using surface EMG.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The success of large language models has driven interest in developing similar speech processing capabilities. However, a key challenge is the scarcity of high-quality spontaneous speech data, as most existing datasets contain scripted dialogues. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for eliciting and recording natural dialogues and release our Stage 1 dataset with 200+ hours of spontaneous speech. Our approach fosters fluid, natural conversations while encouraging a diverse range of topics and interactive exchanges. Unlike traditional methods, it facilitates genuine interactions, providing a reproducible framework for future data collection. This paper introduces our dataset and methodology, laying the groundwork for addressing the shortage of spontaneous speech data. We plan to expand this dataset in future stages, offering a growing resource for the research community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, their ability to detect false assumptions and reason critically is crucial for ensuring reliable outputs. False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual reasoning across regions. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge categories, and multi-hop reasoning types, highlighting the need for improved false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into hiring processes, concerns about fairness have gained prominence. When applying for jobs, companies often request/require demographic information, including gender, race, and disability or veteran status. This data is collected to support diversity and inclusion initiatives, but when provided to LLMs, especially disability-related information, it raises concerns about potential biases in candidate selection outcomes. Many studies have highlighted how disability can impact CV screening, yet little research has explored the specific effect of voluntarily disclosed information on LLM-driven candidate selection. This study seeks to bridge that gap. When candidates shared identical gender, race, qualifications, experience, and backgrounds, and sought jobs with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without disabilities (e.g., Cashier, Software Developer), LLMs consistently favored candidates who disclosed that they had no disability. Even in cases where candidates chose not to disclose their disability status, the LLMs were less likely to select them compared to those who explicitly stated they did not have a disability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Healthcare decision-making represents one of the most challenging domains for Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the integration of diverse knowledge sources, complex reasoning, and various external analytical tools. Current AI systems often rely on either task-specific models, which offer limited adaptability, or general language models without grounding with specialized external knowledge and tools. We introduce MedOrch, a novel framework that orchestrates multiple specialized tools and reasoning agents to provide comprehensive medical decision support. MedOrch employs a modular, agent-based architecture that facilitates the flexible integration of domain-specific tools without altering the core system. Furthermore, it ensures transparent and traceable reasoning processes, enabling clinicians to meticulously verify each intermediate step underlying the system's recommendations. We evaluate MedOrch across three distinct medical applications: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, chest X-ray interpretation, and medical visual question answering, using authentic clinical datasets. The results demonstrate MedOrch's competitive performance across these diverse medical tasks. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 93.26%, surpassing the state-of-the-art baseline by over four percentage points. For predicting Alzheimer's disease progression, it attains a 50.35% accuracy, marking a significant improvement. In chest X-ray analysis, MedOrch exhibits superior performance with a Macro AUC of 61.2% and a Macro F1-score of 25.5%. Moreover, in complex multimodal visual question answering (Image+Table), MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 54.47%. These findings underscore MedOrch's potential to advance healthcare AI by enabling reasoning-driven tool utilization for multimodal medical data processing and supporting intricate cognitive tasks in clinical decision-making.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting, Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure. Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity. Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.

  Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive and large-scale intent classification systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Radiology reports are critical for clinical decision-making but often lack a standardized format, limiting both human interpretability and machine learning (ML) applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%, GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

  The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3 models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS) models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

  Social determinants of health (SDOH) extraction from clinical text is critical for downstream healthcare analytics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, they may rely on superficial cues leading to spurious predictions. Using the MIMIC portion of the SHAC (Social History Annotation Corpus) dataset and focusing on drug status extraction as a case study, we demonstrate that mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely induce models to predict current/past drug use where none is present, while also uncovering concerning gender disparities in model performance. We further evaluate mitigation strategies - such as prompt engineering and chain-of-thought reasoning - to reduce these false positives, providing insights into enhancing LLM reliability in health domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation. However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences, which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable, verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based, reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework, thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm applicable across all language tasks.

  In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable advancements, yet hallucination, where models produce inaccurate or non-factual statements, remains a significant challenge for real-world deployment. Although current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space. Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

  Code-switching (CS) is the alternating use of two or more languages within a conversation or utterance, often influenced by social context and speaker identity. This linguistic phenomenon poses challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which are typically designed for a single language and struggle to handle multilingual inputs. The growing global demand for multilingual applications, including Code-Switching ASR (CSASR), Text-to-Speech (CSTTS), and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), highlights the inadequacy of existing monolingual datasets.Although some code-switching datasets exist, most are limited to bilingual mixing within homogeneous ethnic groups, leaving a critical need for a large-scale, diverse benchmark akin to ImageNet in computer vision.To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LinguaMaster}, a multi-agent collaboration framework specifically designed for efficient and scalable multilingual data synthesis. Leveraging this framework, we curate \textbf{SwitchLingua}, the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic code-switching dataset, including: (1) 420K CS textual samples across 12 languages, and (2) over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers representing 18 countries/regions and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds, based on the textual data. This dataset captures rich linguistic and cultural diversity, offering a foundational resource for advancing multilingual and multicultural research. Furthermore, to address the issue that existing ASR evaluation metrics lack sensitivity to code-switching scenarios, we propose the \textbf{Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER)}, a novel evaluation metric that incorporates semantic information, providing a more accurate and context-aware assessment of system performance.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) encode behaviors such as refusal within their activation space, yet identifying these behaviors remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on predefined refusal templates detectable in output tokens or require manual analysis. We introduce \textbf{COSMIC} (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an automated framework for direction selection that identifies viable steering directions and target layers using cosine similarity - entirely independent of model outputs. COSMIC achieves steering performance comparable to prior methods without requiring assumptions about a model's refusal behavior, such as the presence of specific refusal tokens. It reliably identifies refusal directions in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, and is capable of steering such models toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals, demonstrating robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions.

  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn dialogue and other sustained interactive scenarios, it is essential to understand how extended context affects their performance. Popular benchmarks, focusing primarily on single-turn question answering (QA) tasks, fail to capture the effects of multi-turn exchanges. To address this gap, we introduce a novel set of benchmarks that systematically vary the volume and nature of prior context. We evaluate multiple conventional LLMs, including GPT, Claude, and Gemini, across these benchmarks to measure their sensitivity to contextual variations. Our findings reveal that LLM performance on multiple-choice questions can degrade dramatically in multi-turn interactions, with performance drops as large as 73% for certain models. Even highly capable models such as GPT-4o exhibit up to a 32% decrease in accuracy. Notably, the relative performance of larger versus smaller models is not always predictable. Moreover, the strategic placement of the task description within the context can substantially mitigate performance drops, improving the accuracy by as much as a factor of 3.5. These findings underscore the need for robust strategies to design, evaluate, and mitigate context-related sensitivity in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping public discourse, yet their politico-economic biases remain underexamined in non-Western and low-resource multilingual contexts. This paper presents a systematic analysis of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five low-resource languages spoken in Pakistan: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, and Pashto. We propose a novel framework that integrates an adapted Political Compass Test (PCT) with a multi-level framing analysis. Our method combines quantitative assessment of political orientation across economic (left-right) and social (libertarian-authoritarian) axes with qualitative analysis of framing through content, style, and emphasis. We further contextualize this analysis by aligning prompts with 11 key socio-political themes relevant to Pakistani society. Our results reveal that LLMs predominantly align with liberal-left values, echoing Western training data influences, but exhibit notable shifts toward authoritarian framing in regional languages, suggesting strong cultural modulation effects. We also identify consistent model-specific bias signatures and language-conditioned variations in ideological expression. These findings show the urgent need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing frameworks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal language models (MLMs) increasingly communicate in human-like ways, yet their ability to use reference words remains largely overlooked despite their ubiquity in everyday communication. Our study addresses this gap by comparing human and MLM use of three word classes with increasing cognitive demands: vocabulary words, possessive pronouns (`mine' vs `yours'), and demonstrative pronouns (`this one' vs `that one'). Evaluating seven state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants, we observe a clear difficulty hierarchy: while MLMs approach human-level performance on the vocabulary task, they show substantial deficits with possessives and demonstratives. Our analysis reveals these difficulties stem from limitations in perspective-taking and spatial reasoning. Although prompt engineering improved model performance on possessive use, demonstrative use remained well below human-level competence. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that producing grammatical forms requiring pragmatics and social cognition remains a clear challenge in current NLP systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in error handling. Current error-handling works are performed in a passive manner, with explicit error-handling instructions. However, in real-world scenarios, explicit error-handling instructions are usually unavailable. In this paper, our work identifies this challenge as how to conduct proactive error handling without explicit error handling instructions. To promote further research, this work introduces a new benchmark, termed Mis-prompt, consisting of four evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset. Furthermore, this work analyzes current LLMs' performance on the benchmark, and the experimental results reveal that current LLMs show poor performance on proactive error handling, and SFT on error handling instances improves LLMs' proactive error handling capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available.

  In this work we present the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a comprehensive framework of 58 empirically grounded techniques organized into nine categories, designed to detect subtle forms of social influence in textual content. We also investigate the LLMs ability to identify various forms of social influence. Building on interdisciplinary foundations, we construct the SITT dataset -- a 746-dialogue corpus annotated by 11 experts in Polish and translated into English -- to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify these techniques. Using a hierarchical multi-label classification setup, we benchmark five LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama-3.1, Mixtral, and PLLuM. Our results show that while some models, notably Claude 3.5, achieved moderate success (F1 score = 0.45 for categories), overall performance of models remains limited, particularly for context-sensitive techniques. The findings demonstrate key limitations in current LLMs' sensitivity to nuanced linguistic cues and underscore the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning. This work contributes a novel resource and evaluation example for understanding how LLMs detect, classify, and potentially replicate strategies of social influence in natural dialogues.

  Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, particularly through the integration of external tools and APIs. However, their effectiveness is frequently hampered by parameter mis-filling during tool calling. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Tool Error Checklist (HiTEC) framework to systematically diagnose and mitigate tool-calling errors without relying on extensive real-world interactions. HiTEC introduces a two-tiered approach: a global error checklist that identifies common, cross-tool issues, and a local error checklist that targets tool-specific and contextual failures. Building on this structure, we propose two deployments: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL embeds the global checklist in the initial prompts and leverages a two-round conversational interaction to dynamically refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates high-quality negative examples to drive fine-tuning via preference-based optimization. Extensive experiments across five public datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parameter-filling accuracy and tool-calling success rates compared to baseline methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models have underscored the efficacy of Process Reward Models (PRMs) in addressing intermediate errors through structured feedback mechanisms. This study analyzes PRMs from multiple perspectives, including training methodologies, scalability, and generalization capabilities. We investigate the interplay between pre-training and reward model training FLOPs to assess their influence on PRM efficiency and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks. Our analysis reveals a pattern of diminishing returns in performance with increasing PRM scale, highlighting the importance of balancing model size and computational cost. Furthermore, the diversity of training datasets significantly impacts PRM performance, emphasizing the importance of diverse data to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. We further examine test-time scaling strategies, identifying Monte Carlo Tree Search as the most effective method when computational resources are abundant, while Best-of-N Sampling serves as a practical alternative under resource-limited conditions. Notably, our findings indicate that PRMs trained on mathematical datasets exhibit performance comparable to those tailored for code generation, suggesting robust cross-domain generalization. Employing a gradient-based metric, we observe that PRMs exhibit a preference for selecting responses with similar underlying patterns, further informing their optimization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a new method for estimating how much a model ``knows'' about a datapoint and use it to measure the capacity of modern language models. Prior studies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle memorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two components: \textit{unintended memorization}, the information a model contains about a specific dataset, and \textit{generalization}, the information a model contains about the true data-generation process. When we completely eliminate generalization, we can compute the total memorization, which provides an estimate of model capacity: our measurements estimate that GPT-style models have a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter. We train language models on datasets of increasing size and observe that models memorize until their capacity fills, at which point ``grokking'' begins, and unintended memorization decreases as models begin to generalize. We train hundreds of transformer language models ranging from $500K$ to $1.5B$ parameters and produce a series of scaling laws relating model capacity and data size to membership inference.

  _Anum Afzal, Florian Matthes, Gal Chechik, Yftah Ziser_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate whether the success of a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process can be predicted before completion. We discover that a probing classifier, based on LLM representations, performs well \emph{even before a single token is generated}, suggesting that crucial information about the reasoning process is already present in the initial steps representations. In contrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated tokens, performs worse, likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues rather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning steps does not always improve classification. When additional context is unhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs encode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early without loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that truncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all, though a gap remains compared to full reasoning. However, approaches like supervised learning or reinforcement learning designed to shorten CoT chains could leverage our classifier's guidance to identify when early stopping is effective. Our findings provide insights that may support such methods, helping to optimize CoT's efficiency while preserving its benefits.

  Automated radiology report generation from chest X-ray (CXR) images has the potential to improve clinical efficiency and reduce radiologists' workload. However, most datasets, including the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus, consist entirely of free-form reports, which are inherently variable and unstructured. This variability poses challenges for both generation and evaluation: existing models struggle to produce consistent, clinically meaningful reports, and standard evaluation metrics fail to capture the nuances of radiological interpretation. To address this, we introduce Structured Radiology Report Generation (SRRG), a new task that reformulates free-text radiology reports into a standardized format, ensuring clarity, consistency, and structured clinical reporting. We create a novel dataset by restructuring reports using large language models (LLMs) following strict structured reporting desiderata. Additionally, we introduce SRR-BERT, a fine-grained disease classification model trained on 55 labels, enabling more precise and clinically informed evaluation of structured reports. To assess report quality, we propose F1-SRR-BERT, a metric that leverages SRR-BERT's hierarchical disease taxonomy to bridge the gap between free-text variability and structured clinical reporting. We validate our dataset through a reader study conducted by five board-certified radiologists and extensive benchmarking experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SwingArena, a competitive evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that closely mirrors real-world software development workflows. Unlike traditional static benchmarks, SwingArena models the collaborative process of software iteration by pairing LLMs as submitters, who generate patches, and reviewers, who create test cases and verify the patches through continuous integration (CI) pipelines. To support these interactive evaluations, we introduce a retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) module that efficiently handles long-context challenges by providing syntactically and semantically relevant code snippets from large codebases, supporting multiple programming languages (C++, Python, Rust, and Go). This enables the framework to scale across diverse tasks and contexts while respecting token limitations. Our experiments, using over 400 high-quality real-world GitHub issues selected from a pool of 2,300 issues, show that models like GPT-4o excel at aggressive patch generation, whereas DeepSeek and Gemini prioritize correctness in CI validation. SwingArena presents a scalable and extensible methodology for evaluating LLMs in realistic, CI-driven software development settings. More details are available on our project page:this http URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pruning has recently been widely adopted to reduce the parameter scale and improve the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Mainstream pruning techniques often rely on uniform layerwise pruning strategies, which can lead to severe performance degradation at high sparsity levels. Recognizing the varying contributions of different layers in LLMs, recent studies have shifted their focus toward non-uniform layerwise pruning. However, these approaches often rely on pre-defined values, which can result in suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP). This approach adaptively determines the relative importance of each layer by integrating model weights with input activation information, assigning pruning rates accordingly. Experimental results show that DLP effectively preserves model performance at high sparsity levels across multiple LLMs. Specifically, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the perplexity of LLaMA2-7B by 7.79 and improves the average accuracy by 2.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DLP is compatible with various existing LLM compression techniques and can be seamlessly integrated into Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). We release the code at [this https URL](this https URL) to facilitate future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) achieve near-perfect scores on medical licensing exams, these evaluations inadequately reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world clinical practice. We introduce MedHELM, an extensible evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance for medical tasks with three key contributions. First, a clinician-validated taxonomy spanning 5 categories, 22 subcategories, and 121 tasks developed with 29 clinicians. Second, a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising 35 benchmarks (17 existing, 18 newly formulated) providing complete coverage of all categories and subcategories in the taxonomy. Third, a systematic comparison of LLMs with improved evaluation methods (using an LLM-jury) and a cost-performance analysis. Evaluation of 9 frontier LLMs, using the 35 benchmarks, revealed significant performance variation. Advanced reasoning models (DeepSeek R1: 66% win-rate; o3-mini: 64% win-rate) demonstrated superior performance, though Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable results at 40% lower estimated computational cost. On a normalized accuracy scale (0-1), most models performed strongly in Clinical Note Generation (0.73-0.85) and Patient Communication & Education (0.78-0.83), moderately in Medical Research Assistance (0.65-0.75), and generally lower in Clinical Decision Support (0.56-0.72) and Administration & Workflow (0.53-0.63). Our LLM-jury evaluation method achieved good agreement with clinician ratings (ICC = 0.47), surpassing both average clinician-clinician agreement (ICC = 0.43) and automated baselines including ROUGE-L (0.36) and BERTScore-F1 (0.44). Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable performance to top models at lower estimated cost. These findings highlight the importance of real-world, task-specific evaluation for medical use of LLMs and provides an open source framework to enable this.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4 win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on harmlessness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

  Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection. However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g., recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) -- which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based ("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question) evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a challenging task. Our benchmark is available atthis https URL.

  Recently, long chain of thought (LCoT), Large Language Models (LLMs), have taken the machine learning world by storm with their breathtaking reasoning capabilities. However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in historical linguistics as well as many other domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge. This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence editing success.

  Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need for future research to bridge this divide.

  While densely annotated image captions significantly facilitate the learning of robust vision-language alignment, methodologies for systematically optimizing human annotation efforts remain underexplored. We introduce Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk), an AI-in-the-loop methodology designed to maximize the number of annotated samples and improve their comprehensiveness under fixed budget constraints (e.g., total human annotation time). The framework is built upon two key insights. First, sequential annotation reduces redundant workload compared to conventional parallel annotation, as subsequent annotators only need to annotate the ``residual'' -- the missing visual information that previous annotations have not covered. Second, humans process textual input faster by reading while outputting annotations with much higher throughput via talking; thus a multimodal interface enables optimized efficiency. We evaluate our framework from two aspects: intrinsic evaluations that assess the comprehensiveness of semantic units, obtained by parsing detailed captions into object-attribute trees and analyzing their effective connections; extrinsic evaluation measures the practical usage of the annotated captions in facilitating vision-language alignment. Experiments with eight participants show our Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) improves annotation speed (0.42 vs. 0.30 units/sec) and retrieval performance (41.13% vs. 40.52%) over the parallel method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-quality multilingual training data is essential for effectively pretraining large language models (LLMs). Yet, the availability of suitable open-source multilingual datasets remains limited. Existing state-of-the-art datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands. JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2. JQL notably enhances downstream model training quality and increases data retention rates. Our research provides practical insights and valuable resources for multilingual data curation, raising the standards of multilingual dataset development.

  Evaluating tables qualitatively and quantitatively poses a significant challenge, as standard metrics often overlook subtle structural and content-level discrepancies. To address this, we propose a rubric-based evaluation framework that integrates multi-level structural descriptors with fine-grained contextual signals, enabling more precise and consistent table comparison. Building on this, we introduce TabXEval, an eXhaustive and eXplainable two-phase evaluation framework. TabXEval first aligns reference and predicted tables structurally via TabAlign, then performs semantic and syntactic comparison using TabCompare, offering interpretable and granular feedback. We evaluate TabXEval on TabXBench, a diverse, multi-domain benchmark featuring realistic table perturbations and human annotations. A sensitivity-specificity analysis further demonstrates the robustness and explainability of TabXEval across varied table tasks. Code and data are available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer-use agents (CUAs) promise to automate complex tasks across operating systems (OS) and the web, but remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection. Current evaluations of this threat either lack support realistic but controlled environments or ignore hybrid web-OS attack scenarios involving both interfaces. To address this, we propose RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing framework featuring a novel hybrid sandbox that integrates a VM-based OS environment with Docker-based web platforms. Our sandbox supports key features tailored for red teaming, such as flexible adversarial scenario configuration, and a setting that decouples adversarial evaluation from navigational limitations of CUAs by initializing tests directly at the point of an adversarial injection. Using RedTeamCUA, we develop RTC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with 864 examples that investigate realistic, hybrid web-OS attack scenarios and fundamental security vulnerabilities. Benchmarking current frontier CUAs identifies significant vulnerabilities: Claude 3.7 Sonnet | CUA demonstrates an ASR of 42.9%, while Operator, the most secure CUA evaluated, still exhibits an ASR of 7.6%. Notably, CUAs often attempt to execute adversarial tasks with an Attempt Rate as high as 92.5%, although failing to complete them due to capability limitations. Nevertheless, we observe concerning ASRs of up to 50% in realistic end-to-end settings, with the recently released frontier Claude 4 Opus | CUA showing an alarming ASR of 48%, demonstrating that indirect prompt injection presents tangible risks for even advanced CUAs despite their capabilities and safeguards. Overall, RedTeamCUA provides an essential framework for advancing realistic, controlled, and systematic analysis of CUA vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses to indirect prompt injection prior to real-world deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

  The development of high-performing, robust, and reliable speech technologies depends on large, high-quality datasets. However, African languages -- including our focus, Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba -- remain under-represented due to insufficient data. Popular voice-enabled technologies do not support any of the 2000+ African languages, limiting accessibility for circa one billion people. While previous dataset efforts exist for the target languages, they lack the scale and diversity needed for robust speech models. To bridge this gap, we introduce the NaijaVoices dataset, a 1,800-hour speech-text dataset with 5,000+ speakers. We outline our unique data collection approach, analyze its acoustic diversity, and demonstrate its impact through finetuning experiments on automatic speech recognition, averagely achieving 75.86% (Whisper), 52.06% (MMS), and 42.33% (XLSR) WER improvements. These results highlight NaijaVoices' potential to advance multilingual speech processing for African languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing number of academic papers poses significant challenges for researchers to efficiently acquire key details. While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g., sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including a self-annotated one AIRQA-REAL, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning playing a key role in adapting them to specific applications. However, obtaining ground truth answers for training LLMs in mathematical problem-solving is often challenging, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. This research delves into the utilization of format and length as surrogate signals to train LLMs for mathematical problem-solving, bypassing the need for traditional ground truth answers. Our study shows that a reward function centered on format correctness alone can yield performance improvements comparable to the standard GRPO algorithm in early phases. Recognizing the limitations of format-only rewards in the later phases, we incorporate length-based rewards. The resulting GRPO approach, leveraging format-length surrogate signals, not only matches but surpasses the performance of the standard GRPO algorithm relying on ground truth answers in certain scenarios, achieving 40.0% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model. Through systematic exploration and experimentation, this research not only offers a practical solution for training LLMs to solve mathematical problems and reducing the dependence on extensive ground truth data collection, but also reveals the essence of why our label-free approach succeeds: the powerful base model is like an excellent student who has already mastered mathematical and logical reasoning skills, but performs poorly on the test paper, it simply needs to develop good answering habits to achieve outstanding results in exams, to unlock the capabilities it already possesses.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on natural language tasks, but their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Existing explanation methods either suffer from limited faithfulness to the model's reasoning or produce explanations that humans find difficult to understand. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ProtoSurE}, a novel prototype-based surrogate framework that provides faithful and human-understandable explanations for LLMs. ProtoSurE trains an interpretable-by-design surrogate model that aligns with the target LLM while utilizing sentence-level prototypes as human-understandable concepts. Extensive experiments show that ProtoSurE consistently outperforms SOTA explanation methods across diverse LLMs and datasets. Importantly, ProtoSurE demonstrates strong data efficiency, requiring relatively few training examples to achieve good performance, making it practical for real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to move beyond fast System-1 responses and engage in deliberative System-2 reasoning. However, this comes at the cost of significant inefficiency due to verbose intermediate output. Recent latent-space reasoning methods improve efficiency by operating on hidden states without decoding into language, yet they treat all steps uniformly, failing to distinguish critical deductions from auxiliary steps and resulting in suboptimal use of computational resources. In this paper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths in latent space. Specifically, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of dynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the vertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter branches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer layers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps to skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space. Training System-1.5 Reasoning involves a two-stage self-distillation process: first distilling natural language CoT into latent-space continuous thought, and then distilling full-path System-2 latent reasoning into adaptive shortcut paths (System-1.5 Reasoning). Experiments on reasoning tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method. For example, on GSM8K, System-1.5 Reasoning achieves reasoning performance comparable to traditional CoT fine-tuning methods while accelerating inference by over 20x and reducing token generation by 92.31% on average.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As online platforms grow, comment sections increasingly host harassment that undermines user experience and well-being. This study benchmarks three leading large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings, GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.

  High-quality instruction data is crucial for developing large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches struggle to effectively control instruction complexity. We present TAG-INSTRUCT, a novel framework that enhances instruction complexity through structured semantic compression and controlled difficulty augmentation. Unlike previous prompt-based methods operating on raw text, TAG-INSTRUCT compresses instructions into a compact tag space and systematically enhances complexity through RL-guided tag expansion. Through extensive experiments, we show that TAG-INSTRUCT outperforms existing instruction complexity augmentation approaches. Our analysis reveals that operating in tag space provides superior controllability and stability across different instruction synthesis frameworks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a set of training-free ABX-style discrimination tasks to evaluate how multilingual language models represent language identity (form) and semantic content (meaning). Inspired from speech processing, these zero-shot tasks measure whether minimal differences in representation can be reliably detected. This offers a flexible and interpretable alternative to probing. Applied to XLM-R (Conneau et al, 2020) across pretraining checkpoints and layers, we find that language discrimination declines over training and becomes concentrated in lower layers, while meaning discrimination strengthens over time and stabilizes in deeper layers. We then explore probing tasks, showing some alignment between our metrics and linguistic learning performance. Our results position ABX tasks as a lightweight framework for analyzing the structure of multilingual representations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conversations are usually structured by roles -- who is speaking, who's being addressed, and who's listening -- and unfold in threads that break with changes in speaker floor or topical focus. While large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible capabilities in dialogue and reasoning, their ability to understand fine-grained conversational structure, especially in multi-modal, multi-party settings, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a suite of tasks focused on conversational role attribution (speaker, addressees, side-participants) and conversation threading (utterance linking and clustering), drawing on conversation analysis and sociolinguistics. To support those tasks, we present a human annotated dataset of 4,398 annotations for speakers and reply-to relationship, 5,755 addressees, and 3,142 side-participants.We evaluate popular audio-visual LLMs and vision-language models on our dataset, and our experimental results suggest that multimodal conversational structure understanding remains challenging. The most performant audio-visual LLM outperforms all vision-language models across all metrics, especially in speaker and addressee recognition. However, its performance drops significantly when conversation participants are anonymized. The number of conversation participants in a clip is the strongest negative predictor of role-attribution performance, while acoustic clarity (measured by pitch and spectral centroid) and detected face coverage yield positive associations. We hope this work lays the groundwork for future evaluation and development of multimodal LLMs that can reason more effectively about conversation structure.

  The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking. It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an automated assessment of both the chatbot's adherence to MI and client responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors. The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.

  _Jintian Shao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus, following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information, thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue systems, and style transfer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, raising concerns about the unauthorized use of copyrighted or sensitive data. Machine unlearning aims to remove such 'forget' data while preserving utility and information from the 'retain' set. However, existing evaluations typically assume that forget and retain sets are fully disjoint, overlooking realistic scenarios where they share overlapping content. For instance, a news article may need to be unlearned, even though the same event, such as an earthquake in Japan, is also described factually on Wikipedia. Effective unlearning should remove the specific phrasing of the news article while preserving publicly supported facts. In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a benchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap. DUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in different styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and other content remaining unique to each. When one set is designated for unlearning, an ideal method should remove its unique content while preserving shared facts. We define seven evaluation metrics to assess whether unlearning methods can achieve this selective removal. Our evaluation of nine recent unlearning methods reveals a key limitation: while most can remove surface-level text, they often fail to erase deeper, context-specific knowledge without damaging shared content. We release DUSK as a public benchmark to support the development of more precise and reliable unlearning techniques for real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Research on holistic Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is long-dated; yet, there is a notable lack of attention for assessing essays according to individual traits. In this work, we propose TRATES, a novel trait-specific and rubric-based cross-prompt AES framework that is generic yet specific to the underlying trait. The framework leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) that utilizes the trait grading rubrics to generate trait-specific features (represented by assessment questions), then assesses those features given an essay. The trait-specific features are eventually combined with generic writing-quality and prompt-specific features to train a simple classical regression model that predicts trait scores of essays from an unseen prompt. Experiments show that TRATES achieves a new state-of-the-art performance across all traits on a widely-used dataset, with the generated LLM-based features being the most significant.

  The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is intrinsically linked to the quality of its training data. Although several studies have proposed methods for high-quality data selection, they do not consider the importance of knowledge richness in text corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel and gradient-free High-Knowledge Scorer (HKS) to select high-quality data from the dimension of knowledge, to alleviate the problem of knowledge scarcity in the pre-trained corpus. We propose a comprehensive multi-domain knowledge element pool and introduce knowledge density and coverage as metrics to assess the knowledge content of the text. Based on this, we propose a comprehensive knowledge scorer to select data with intensive knowledge, which can also be utilized for domain-specific high-knowledge data selection by restricting knowledge elements to the specific domain. We train models on a high-knowledge bilingual dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that our scorer improves the model's performance in knowledge-intensive and general comprehension tasks, and is effective in enhancing both the generic and domain-specific capabilities of the model.

  Taxonomies are hierarchical knowledge graphs crucial for recommendation systems, and web applications. As data grows, expanding taxonomies is essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We propose LORex (Lineage-Oriented Reasoning for Taxonomy Expansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and languages. In this study, we focus on natural language understanding in three classical languages -- Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and Latin -- to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual zero-shot generalization. First, we explore named entity recognition and machine translation into English. While LLMs perform equal to or better than fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle, especially with niche or abstract entity types. In addition, we concentrate on Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question-answering (QA) dataset and show that incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly boosts performance. In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for smaller LLMs across these QA tasks. These results suggest model scale as an important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization. Assuming that models used such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 are not instruction fine-tuned on classical languages, our findings provide insights into how LLMs may generalize on these languages and their consequent utility in classical studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however, their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$, and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that $\tt A^\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example, under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2, outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the versatility of $\tt A^\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and mixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on task-specific data is essential for their effective deployment. As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the model's predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just 10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement and a 7.4$\times$ speedup.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterspeech has proven to be a powerful tool to combat hate speech online. Previous studies have focused on generating counterspeech conditioned only on specific intents (single attributed). However, a holistic approach considering multiple attributes simultaneously can yield more nuanced and effective responses. Here, we introduce HiPPrO, Hierarchical Prefix learning with Preference Optimization, a novel two-stage framework that utilizes the effectiveness of attribute-specific prefix embedding spaces hierarchically optimized during the counterspeech generation process in the first phase. Thereafter, we incorporate both reference and reward-free preference optimization to generate more constructive counterspeech. Furthermore, we extend IntentCONANv2 by annotating all 13,973 counterspeech instances with emotion labels by five annotators. HiPPrO leverages hierarchical prefix optimization to integrate these dual attributes effectively. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that HiPPrO achieves a ~38 % improvement in intent conformity and a ~3 %, ~2 %, ~3 % improvement in Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L, respectively, compared to several baseline models. Human evaluations further substantiate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the enhanced relevance and appropriateness of the generated counterspeech. This work underscores the potential of multi-attribute conditioning in advancing the efficacy of counterspeech generation systems. Our code is available on Github and dataset is open-sourced on Hugging-face.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal reference resolution, including phrase grounding, aims to understand the semantic relations between mentions and real-world objects. Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task. In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses. This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative models for this task, MDETR and GLIP. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that incorporating textual reference relations strengthens the confidence scores between mentions, including pronouns and predicates, and objects, which can reduce the ambiguities that arise in visually grounded dialogues.

  Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in morphological inflection tasks, yet their ability to generalize across languages and morphological rules remains limited. One possible explanation for this behavior can be the degree to which these models are able to capture implicit phenomena at the phonological and subphonemic levels. We introduce a language-agnostic probing method to investigate phonological feature encoding in transformers trained directly on phonemes, and perform it across seven morphologically diverse languages. We show that phonological features which are local, such as final-obstruent devoicing in Turkish, are captured well in phoneme embeddings, whereas long-distance dependencies like vowel harmony are better represented in the transformer's encoder. Finally, we discuss how these findings inform empirical strategies for training morphological models, particularly regarding the role of subphonemic feature acquisition.

  Motivated by the surge of large language models, there has been a push to formally characterize the symbolic abilities intrinsic to the transformer architecture. A programming language, called RASP, has been proposed, which can be directly compiled into transformer weights to implement these algorithms. However, the tasks that can be implemented in RASP are often uncommon to learn from natural unsupervised data, showing a mismatch between theoretical capabilities of the transformer architecture, and the practical learnability of these capabilities from unsupervised data. We propose tracr-injection, a method that allows us to distill algorithms written in RASP directly into a pre-trained language model. We showcase our method by injecting 3 different algorithms into a language model. We show how our method creates an interpretable subspace within the model's residual stream, which can be decoded into the variables present in the code of the RASP algorithm. Additionally, we found that the proposed method can improve out-of-distribution performance compared to our baseline, indicating that indeed a more symbolic mechanism is taking place in the inner workings of the model. We release the code used to run our experiments.

  Recent improvement in large language model performance have, in all likelihood, been accompanied by improvement in how well they can approximate the distribution of their training data. In this work, we explore the following question: which properties of text domains do LLMs faithfully approximate, and how well do they do so? Applying observational approaches familiar from corpus linguistics, we prompt a commonly used, opensource LLM to regenerate text from two domains of permissively licensed English text which are often contained in LLM training data -- Wikipedia and news text. This regeneration paradigm allows us to investigate whether LLMs can faithfully match the original human text domains in a fairly semantically-controlled setting. We investigate varying levels of syntactic abstraction, from more simple properties like sentence length, and article readability, to more complex and higher order properties such as dependency tag distribution, parse depth, and parse complexity. We find that the majority of the regenerated distributions show a shifted mean, a lower standard deviation, and a reduction of the long tail, as compared to the human originals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper argues that the relationship between lexical identity and prosody -- one well-studied parameter of linguistic variation -- can be characterized using information theory. We predict that languages that use prosody to make lexical distinctions should exhibit a higher mutual information between word identity and prosody, compared to languages that don't. We test this hypothesis in the domain of pitch, which is used to make lexical distinctions in tonal languages, like Cantonese. We use a dataset of speakers reading sentences aloud in ten languages across five language families to estimate the mutual information between the text and their pitch curves. We find that, across languages, pitch curves display similar amounts of entropy. However, these curves are easier to predict given their associated text in the tonal languages, compared to pitch- and stress-accent languages, and thus the mutual information is higher in these languages, supporting our hypothesis. Our results support perspectives that view linguistic typology as gradient, rather than categorical.

  Automatic relationship extraction (RE) from biomedical literature is critical for managing the vast amount of scientific knowledge produced each year. In recent years, utilizing pre-trained language models (PLMs) has become the prevalent approach in RE. Several studies report improved performance when incorporating additional context information while fine-tuning PLMs for RE. However, variations in the PLMs applied, the databases used for augmentation, hyper-parameter optimization, and evaluation methods complicate direct comparisons between studies and raise questions about the generalizability of these findings. Our study addresses this research gap by evaluating PLMs enhanced with contextual information on five datasets spanning four relation scenarios within a consistent evaluation framework. We evaluate three baseline PLMs and first conduct extensive hyperparameter optimization. After selecting the top-performing model, we enhance it with additional data, including textual entity descriptions, relational information from knowledge graphs, and molecular structure encodings. Our findings illustrate the importance of i) the choice of the underlying language model and ii) a comprehensive hyperparameter optimization for achieving strong extraction performance. Although inclusion of context information yield only minor overall improvements, an ablation study reveals substantial benefits for smaller PLMs when such external data was included during fine-tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Peer review is a cornerstone of quality control in scientific publishing. With the increasing workload, the unintended use of `quick' heuristics, referred to as lazy thinking, has emerged as a recurring issue compromising review quality. Automated methods to detect such heuristics can help improve the peer-reviewing process. However, there is limited NLP research on this issue, and no real-world dataset exists to support the development of detection tools. This work introduces LazyReview, a dataset of peer-review sentences annotated with fine-grained lazy thinking categories. Our analysis reveals that Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to detect these instances in a zero-shot setting. However, instruction-based fine-tuning on our dataset significantly boosts performance by 10-20 performance points, highlighting the importance of high-quality training data. Furthermore, a controlled experiment demonstrates that reviews revised with lazy thinking feedback are more comprehensive and actionable than those written without such feedback. We will release our dataset and the enhanced guidelines that can be used to train junior reviewers in the community. (Code available here:this https URL)

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The limited reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) cast doubt on their suitability for tasks demanding deep, multi-step logical deduction. This paper introduces a framework called Small Reasons, Large Hints (SMART), which selectively augments SLM reasoning with targeted guidance from large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the concept of cognitive scaffolding, SMART employs a score-based evaluation to identify uncertain reasoning steps and injects corrective LLM-generated reasoning only when necessary. By framing structured reasoning as an optimal policy search, our approach steers the reasoning trajectory toward correct solutions without exhaustive sampling. Our experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that targeted external scaffolding significantly improves performance, paving the way for collaborative use of both SLM and LLM to tackle complex reasoning tasks that are currently unsolvable by SLMs alone.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding is a powerful technique for reducing the latency of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering a fault-tolerant framework that enables the use of highly compressed draft models. In this work, we introduce Self-Distilled Sparse Drafters (SD$^2$), a novel methodology that leverages self-data distillation and fine-grained weight sparsity to produce highly efficient and well-aligned draft models. SD$^2$ systematically enhances draft token acceptance rates while significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate operations (MACs), even in the Universal Assisted Generation (UAG) setting, where draft and target models originate from different model families. On a Llama-3.1-70B target model, SD$^2$ provides a 1.59$\times$ higher Mean Accepted Length (MAL) compared to layer-pruned draft models and reduces MACs by over 43.87% with a 8.36% reduction in MAL compared to a dense draft models. Our 1.5B and 3B unstructured sparse drafters outperform both dense and layer-pruned models in terms of end-to-end latency improvements; highlighting the potential of sparsity-aware fine-tuning and compression strategies to improve LLM inference efficiency while maintaining alignment with target models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we establish a novel theoretical connection between supervised fine-tuning and offline reinforcement learning under the token-level Markov decision process, revealing that large language models indeed learn an implicit $Q$-function for inference. Through this theoretical lens, we demonstrate that the widely used beam search method suffers from unacceptable over-optimism, where inference errors are inevitably amplified due to inflated $Q$-value estimations of suboptimal steps. To address this limitation, we propose Supervised Optimism Correction(SOC), which introduces a simple yet effective auxiliary loss for token-level $Q$-value estimations during supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, the auxiliary loss employs implicit value regularization to boost model confidence in expert-demonstrated responses, thereby suppressing over-optimism toward insufficiently supervised responses. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH, and GAOKAO, showcase the superiority of the proposed SOC with beam search across a series of open-source models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artificial agents are increasingly central to complex interactions and decision-making tasks, yet aligning their behaviors with desired human values remains an open challenge. In this work, we investigate how human-like personality traits influence agent behavior and performance within text-based interactive environments. We introduce PANDA: Personality Adapted Neural Decision Agents, a novel method for projecting human personality traits onto agents to guide their behavior. To induce personality in a text-based game agent, (i) we train a personality classifier to identify what personality type the agent's actions exhibit, and (ii) we integrate the personality profiles directly into the agent's policy-learning pipeline. By deploying agents embodying 16 distinct personality types across 25 text-based games and analyzing their trajectories, we demonstrate that an agent's action decisions can be guided toward specific personality profiles. Moreover, certain personality types, such as those characterized by higher levels of Openness, display marked advantages in performance. These findings underscore the promise of personality-adapted agents for fostering more aligned, effective, and human-centric decision-making in interactive environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world data, such as news articles, social media posts, and chatbot conversations, is inherently dynamic and non-stationary, presenting significant challenges for constructing real-time structured representations through knowledge graphs (KGs). Relation Extraction (RE), a fundamental component of KG creation, often struggles to adapt to evolving data when traditional models rely on static, outdated datasets. Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) methods tackle this issue by incrementally learning new relations while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study investigates the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically large language models (LLMs), to CRE, with a focus on leveraging memory replay to address catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and encoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets. Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over earlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in seen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average accuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel are similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy metrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language model architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory replay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.

  In the interaction between agents and their environments, agents expand their capabilities by planning and executing actions. However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the landscape of machine translation (MT), particularly for low-resource languages and domains that lack sufficient parallel corpora, linguistic tools, and computational infrastructure. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in leveraging LLMs for MT. We analyze techniques such as few-shot prompting, cross-lingual transfer, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA, adapters) that enable effective adaptation to under-resourced settings. The paper also explores synthetic data generation strategies using LLMs, including back-translation and lexical augmentation. Additionally, we compare LLM-based translation with traditional encoder-decoder models across diverse language pairs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each. We discuss persistent challenges - such as hallucinations, evaluation inconsistencies, and inherited biases, while also evaluating emerging LLM-driven metrics for translation quality. This survey offers practical insights and outlines future directions for building robust, inclusive, and scalable MT systems in the era of large-scale generative models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study explores current limitations of learned image captioning evaluation metrics, specifically the lack of granular assessments for errors within captions, and the reliance on single-point quality estimates without considering uncertainty. To address the limitations, we propose a simple yet effective strategy for generating and calibrating distributions of CLIPScore values. Leveraging a model-agnostic conformal risk control framework, we calibrate CLIPScore values for task-specific control variables, tackling the aforementioned limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that using conformal risk control, over score distributions produced with simple methods such as input masking, can achieve competitive performance compared to more complex approaches. Our method effectively detects erroneous words, while providing formal guarantees aligned with desired risk levels. It also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimations and prediction errors, thus enhancing the overall reliability of caption evaluation metrics.

  _Qing Yao, Kanishka Misra, Leonie Weissweiler, Kyle Mahowald_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models (LMs) tend to show human-like preferences on a number of syntactic phenomena, but the extent to which these are attributable to direct exposure to the phenomena or more general properties of language is unclear. We explore this with the English dative alternation (DO: "gave Y the X" vs. PO: "gave the X to Y"), using a controlled rearing paradigm wherein we iteratively train small LMs on systematically manipulated input. We focus on properties that affect the choice of alternant: length and animacy. Both properties are directly present in datives but also reflect more global tendencies for shorter elements to precede longer ones and animates to precede inanimates. First, by manipulating and ablating datives for these biases in the input, we show that direct evidence of length and animacy matters, but easy-first preferences persist even without such evidence. Then, using LMs trained on systematically perturbed datasets to manipulate global length effects (re-linearizing sentences globally while preserving dependency structure), we find that dative preferences can emerge from indirect evidence. We conclude that LMs' emergent syntactic preferences come from a mix of direct and indirect sources.

  _Gaifan Zhang, Yi Zhou, Danushka Bollegala_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The meaning conveyed by a sentence often depends on the context in which it appears. Despite the progress of sentence embedding methods, it remains unclear how to best modify a sentence embedding conditioned on its context. To address this problem, we propose Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings (CASE), an efficient and accurate method to create an embedding for a sentence under a given condition. First, CASE creates an embedding for the condition using a Large Language Model (LLM), where the sentence influences the attention scores computed for the tokens in the condition during pooling. Next, a supervised nonlinear projection is learned to reduce the dimensionality of the LLM-based text embeddings. We show that CASE significantly outperforms previously proposed Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) methods on an existing standard benchmark dataset. We find that subtracting the condition embedding consistently improves the C-STS performance of LLM-based text embeddings. Moreover, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction method that not only reduces the dimensionality of LLM-based embeddings but also significantly improves their performance.

  In the evolving landscape of online discourse, misinformation increasingly adopts humorous tones to evade detection and gain traction. This work introduces Deceptive Humor as a novel research direction, emphasizing how false narratives, when coated in humor, can become more difficult to detect and more likely to spread. To support research in this space, we present the Deceptive Humor Dataset (DHD) a collection of humor-infused comments derived from fabricated claims using the ChatGPT-4o model. Each entry is labeled with a Satire Level (from 1 for subtle satire to 3 for overt satire) and categorized into five humor types: Dark Humor, Irony, Social Commentary, Wordplay, and Absurdity. The dataset spans English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and their code-mixed forms, making it a valuable resource for multilingual analysis. DHD offers a structured foundation for understanding how humor can serve as a vehicle for the propagation of misinformation, subtly enhancing its reach and impact. Strong baselines are established to encourage further research and model development in this emerging area.

  _I-Fan Lin, Faegheh Hasibi, Suzan Verberne_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models (SPILL), an intuitive and domain-adaptive method for intent clustering without fine-tuning. Existing embeddings-based clustering methods rely on a few labeled examples or unsupervised fine-tuning to optimize results for each new dataset, which makes them less generalizable to multiple datasets. Our goal is to make these existing embedders more generalizable to new domain datasets without further fine-tuning. Inspired by our theoretical derivation and simulation results on the effectiveness of sampling and pooling techniques, we view the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem. A good solution to this problem is associated with better clustering performance. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage approach: First, for each utterance (referred to as the seed), we derive its embedding using an existing embedder. Then, we apply a distance metric to select a pool of candidates close to the seed. Because the embedder is not optimized for new datasets, in the second stage, we use an LLM to further select utterances from these candidates that share the same intent as the seed. Finally, we pool these selected candidates with the seed to derive a refined embedding for the seed. We found that our method generally outperforms directly using an embedder, and it achieves comparable results to other state-of-the-art studies, even those that use much larger models and require fine-tuning, showing its strength and efficiency. Our results indicate that our method enables existing embedders to be further improved without additional fine-tuning, making them more adaptable to new domain datasets. Additionally, viewing the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem gives the potential of using LLMs to customize clustering tasks according to the user's goals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) scale, model compression is crucial for edge deployment and accessibility. Weight-only quantization reduces model size but suffers from performance degradation at lower bit widths. Moreover, standard finetuning is incompatible with quantized models, and alternative methods often fall short of full finetuning. In this paper, we propose ClusComp, a simple yet effective compression paradigm that clusters weight matrices into codebooks and finetunes them block-by-block. ClusComp (1) achieves superior performance in 2-4 bit quantization, (2) pushes compression to 1-bit while outperforming ultra-low-bit methods with minimal finetuning, and (3) enables efficient finetuning, even surpassing existing quantization-based approaches and rivaling full FP16 finetuning. Notably, ClusComp supports compression and finetuning of 70B LLMs on a single A6000-48GB GPU.

  _Xiang Zhang, Juntai Cao, Jiaqi Wei, Chenyu You, Dujian Ding_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable successes of large language models (LLMs), the underlying Transformer architecture has inherent limitations in handling complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a practical workaround, but most CoT-based methods rely on a single, generic prompt such as "think step by step", with no task-specific adaptation. These approaches expect the model to discover an effective reasoning path on its own, forcing it to search through a vast prompt space. In contrast, several studies have explored task-specific prompt designs to boost performance. However, these designs are typically developed through trial and error, lacking theoretical grounding. As a result, prompt engineering remains largely ad hoc and unguided. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains why some prompts succeed while others fail. We show that prompts function as selectors, extracting task-relevant information from the model's full hidden state during CoT reasoning. Each prompt defines a unique trajectory through the answer space, and the choice of trajectory is crucial for task performance and future navigation within the space. We analyze the complexity of finding optimal prompts and characterize the size of the prompt space for a given task. Our theory reveals principles behind effective prompt design and shows that naive CoT-using self-guided prompts like "think step by step"-can severely hinder performance. Through experiments, we show that optimal prompt search can lead to more than a 50% improvement on reasoning tasks, providing a theoretical foundation for prompt engineering.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers often struggle to generalize to longer sequences than those seen during training, a limitation known as length extrapolation. Most existing Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) methods attempt to address this by introducing either fixed linear biases or globally learned biases, which lack the capacity to adapt to different input contexts. In this work, we propose an additive RPE, Context-Aware Biases for Length Extrapolation (CABLE), a method that learns token-specific, context-aware biases for each attention head in transformers. By dynamically adjusting positional biases based on the input sequence, CABLE overcomes the rigidity of fixed RPEs. When evaluated on sequences longer than originally trained with, GPT-2 Medium (334M parameters) with CABLE achieves lower perplexity than counterparts using other widely adopted positional encoding methods. Additionally, by applying CABLE to the BERT base model we improved performance in long-context retrieval tasks. Our method significantly enhances the extrapolation performance of existing RPE methods tested on the FineWeb-Edu10B and WikiText-103 datasets. Code is available at:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time compute is emerging as a new paradigm for enhancing language models' complex multi-step reasoning capabilities, as demonstrated by the success of OpenAI's o1 and o3, as well as DeepSeek's R1. Compared to explicit reasoning in test-time compute, implicit reasoning is more inference-efficient, requiring fewer generated tokens. However, why does the advanced reasoning capability fail to emerge in the implicit reasoning style? In this work, we train GPT-2 from scratch on a curated multi-step mathematical reasoning dataset and conduct analytical experiments to investigate how language models perform implicit reasoning in multi-step tasks. Our findings reveal: 1) Language models can perform step-by-step reasoning and achieve high accuracy in both in-domain and out-of-domain tests via implicit reasoning. However, this capability only emerges when trained on fixed-pattern data. 2) Conversely, implicit reasoning abilities emerging from training on unfixed-pattern data tend to overfit a specific pattern and fail to generalize further. Notably, this limitation is also observed in state-of-the-art large language models. These findings suggest that language models acquire implicit reasoning through shortcut learning, enabling strong performance on tasks with similar patterns while lacking generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The field of neural machine translation (NMT) has changed with the advent of large language models (LLMs). Much of the recent emphasis in natural language processing (NLP) has been on modeling machine translation and many other problems using a single pre-trained Transformer decoder, while encoder-decoder architectures, which were the standard in earlier NMT models, have received relatively less attention. In this paper, we explore translation models that are universal, efficient, and easy to optimize, by marrying the world of LLMs with the world of NMT. We apply LLMs to NMT encoding and leave the NMT decoder unchanged. We also develop methods for adapting LLMs to work better with the NMT decoder. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset involving multiple tasks to assess how well the machine translation system generalizes across various tasks. Evaluations on the WMT and our datasets show that results using our method match or surpass a range of baselines in terms of translation quality, but achieve $2.4 \sim 6.5 \times$ inference speedups and a $75\%$ reduction in the memory footprint of the KV cache. It also demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of translation-related tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Integrating structured graph data with rich textual information from nodes poses a significant challenge, particularly for heterophilic node classification. Current approaches often struggle with computational costs or effective fusion of disparate modalities. We propose \textbf{Graph Masked Language Model (GMLM)}, a novel architecture efficiently combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). GMLM introduces three key innovations: (i) a \textbf{dynamic active node selection} strategy for scalable PLM text processing; (ii) a GNN-specific \textbf{contrastive pretraining stage} using soft masking with a learnable graph \texttt{[MASK]} token for robust structural representations; and (iii) a \textbf{dedicated fusion module} integrating RGCN-based GNN embeddings with PLM (GTE-Small \& DistilBERT) embeddings. Extensive experiments on heterophilic benchmarks (Cornell, Wisconsin, Texas) demonstrate GMLM's superiority. Notably, GMLM(DistilBERT) achieves significant performance gains, improving accuracy by over \textbf{4.7\%} on Cornell and over \textbf{2.0\%} on Texas compared to the previous best-performing baselines. This work underscores the benefits of targeted PLM engagement and modality-specific pretraining for improved, efficient learning on text-rich graphs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A radiology report comprises several sections, including the Findings and Impression of the diagnosis. Automatically generating the Impression from the Findings is crucial for reducing radiologists' workload and improving diagnostic accuracy. Pretrained models that excel in common abstractive summarization problems encounter challenges when applied to specialized medical domains largely due to the complex terminology and the necessity for accurate clinical context. Such tasks in medical domains demand extracting core information, avoiding context shifts, and maintaining proper flow. Misuse of medical terms can lead to drastic clinical errors. To address these issues, we introduce a sequential transfer learning that ensures key content extraction and coherent summarization. Sequential transfer learning often faces challenges like initial parameter decay and knowledge loss, which we resolve with the Fisher matrix regularization. Using MIMIC-CXR and Open-I datasets, our model, CSTRL - Context-driven Sequential TRansfer Learning - achieved state-of-the-art performance, showing 56.2% improvement in BLEU-1, 40.5% in BLEU-2, 84.3% in BLEU-3, 28.9% in ROUGE-1, 41.0% in ROUGE-2 and 26.5% in ROGUE-3 score over benchmark studies. We also analyze factual consistency scores while preserving the medical context. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the knowledge outdating problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), it still faces a critical challenge: the prevalence of outdated information in knowledge bases. Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available. Current RAG approaches struggle with both retrieval and generation aspects when handling outdated information. These findings highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to address the temporal challenges in RAG. Our code and data are available at:this https URL.

  Theory-of-Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' perceptions and mental states, is fundamental to human interaction but remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing ToM reasoning methods show promise with reasoning via perceptual perspective-taking, they often rely excessively on off-the-shelf LLMs, reducing their efficiency and limiting their applicability to high-order ToM reasoning. To address these issues, we present EnigmaToM, a novel neuro-symbolic framework that enhances ToM reasoning by integrating a Neural Knowledge Base of entity states (Enigma) for (1) a psychology-inspired iterative masking mechanism that facilitates accurate perspective-taking and (2) knowledge injection that elicits key entity information. Enigma generates structured knowledge of entity states to build spatial scene graphs for belief tracking across various ToM orders and enrich events with fine-grained entity state details. Experimental results on ToMi, HiToM, and FANToM benchmarks show that EnigmaToM significantly improves ToM reasoning across LLMs of varying sizes, particularly excelling in high-order reasoning scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalizing Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical step in facilitating their widespread application to enhance individual life experiences. In pursuit of personalization, distilling key preference information from an individual's historical data as instructional preference context to customize LLM generation has emerged as a promising direction. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation by overlooking the inter-user comparative analysis, which is essential for identifying the inter-user differences that truly shape preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Difference-aware Personalization Learning (DPL), a novel approach that emphasizes extracting inter-user differences to enhance LLM personalization. DPL strategically selects representative users for comparison and establishes a structured standard to extract meaningful, task-relevant differences for customizing LLM generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPL significantly enhances LLM personalization. We release our code atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates the machine unlearning techniques within the context of large language models (LLMs), referred to as \textit{LLM unlearning}. LLM unlearning offers a principled approach to removing the influence of undesirable data (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) from LLMs, while preserving their overall utility without requiring full retraining. Despite growing research interest, there is no comprehensive survey that systematically organizes existing work and distills key insights; here, we aim to bridge this gap. We begin by introducing the definition and the paradigms of LLM unlearning, followed by a comprehensive taxonomy of existing unlearning studies. Next, we categorize current unlearning approaches, summarizing their strengths and limitations. Additionally, we review evaluation metrics and benchmarks, providing a structured overview of current assessment methodologies. Finally, we outline promising directions for future research, highlighting key challenges and opportunities in the field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle with low-resource languages (LRLs), particularly those spoken by minority communities in China, such as Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian. To systematically track the progress in these languages, we introduce MiLiC-Eval, a benchmark designed for minority languages in China, featuring 24K instances across 9 tasks. MiLiC-Eval focuses on underrepresented writing systems. Its parallelism between tasks and languages can provide a faithful and fine-grained assessment of linguistic and problem-solving skills. Our evaluation reveals that open-source LLMs perform poorly on syntax-intensive tasks and multi-script languages. We further demonstrate how MiLiC-Eval can help advance LRL research in handling diverse writing systems and understanding the process of language adaptation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text editing frames grammatical error correction (GEC) as a sequence tagging problem, where edit tags are assigned to input tokens, and applying these edits results in the corrected text. This approach has gained attention for its efficiency and interpretability. However, while extensively explored for English, text editing remains largely underexplored for morphologically rich languages like Arabic. In this paper, we introduce a text editing approach that derives edit tags directly from data, eliminating the need for language-specific edits. We demonstrate its effectiveness on Arabic, a diglossic and morphologically rich language, and investigate the impact of different edit representations on model performance. Our approach achieves SOTA results on two Arabic GEC benchmarks and performs on par with SOTA on two others. Additionally, our models are over six times faster than existing Arabic GEC systems, making our approach more practical for real-world applications. Finally, we explore ensemble models, demonstrating how combining different models leads to further performance improvements. We make our code, data, and pretrained models publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visualizations play a pivotal role in daily communication in an increasingly datadriven world. Research on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for automated chart understanding has accelerated massively, with steady improvements on standard benchmarks. However, for MLLMs to be reliable, they must be robust to misleading visualizations, i.e., charts that distort the underlying data, leading readers to draw inaccurate conclusions that may support disinformation. Here, we uncover an important vulnerability: MLLM questionanswering (QA) accuracy on misleading visualizations drops on average to the level of the random baseline. To address this, we introduce the first inference-time methods to improve QA performance on misleading visualizations, without compromising accuracy on non-misleading ones. We find that two methods, table-based QA and redrawing the visualization, are effective, with improvements of up to 19.6 percentage points. We make our code and data available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many challenging reasoning tasks require not just rapid, intuitive responses, but a more deliberate, multi-step approach. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the "System 1" way of quick reactions to the "System 2" style of reflection-and-correction problem solving. However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model's intermediate reasoning steps unexamined. This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking, and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing performance on general mathematical tasks. We show that models trained on our state checking and transition data demonstrate gains in math reasoning by up to 5.1% on GSM8K.

  We propose EdiText, a controllable text editing method that modifies the reference text to desired attributes at various scales. We integrate an SDEdit-based editing technique that allows for broad adjustments in the degree of text editing. Additionally, we introduce a novel fine-level editing method based on self-conditioning, which allows subtle control of reference text. While being capable of editing on its own, this fine-grained method, integrated with the SDEdit approach, enables EdiText to make precise adjustments within the desired range. EdiText demonstrates its controllability to robustly adjust reference text at a broad range of levels across various tasks, including toxicity control and sentiment control.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  User simulators are crucial for replicating human interactions with dialogue systems, supporting both collaborative training and automatic evaluation, especially for large language models (LLMs). However, current role-playing methods face challenges such as a lack of utterance-level authenticity and user-level diversity, often hindered by role confusion and dependence on predefined profiles of well-known figures. In contrast, direct simulation focuses solely on text, neglecting implicit user traits like personality and conversation-level consistency. To address these issues, we introduce the User Simulator with Implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from human-machine interactions to simulate personalized and realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive profile schema, then refine the simulation using conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing at both the utterance and conversation levels. Finally, a diverse profile sampler captures the distribution of real-world user profiles. Experimental results show that USP outperforms strong baselines in terms of authenticity and diversity while maintaining comparable consistency. Additionally, using USP to evaluate LLM on dynamic multi-turn aligns well with mainstream benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Do language models (LMs) offer insights into human language learning? A common argument against this idea is that because their architecture and training paradigm are so vastly different from humans, LMs can learn arbitrary inputs as easily as natural languages. We test this claim by training LMs to model impossible and typologically unattested languages. Unlike previous work, which has focused exclusively on English, we conduct experiments on 12 languages from 4 language families with two newly constructed parallel corpora. Our results show that while GPT-2 small can largely distinguish attested languages from their impossible counterparts, it does not achieve perfect separation between all the attested languages and all the impossible ones. We further test whether GPT-2 small distinguishes typologically attested from unattested languages with different NP orders by manipulating word order based on Greenberg's Universal 20. We find that the model's perplexity scores do not distinguish attested vs. unattested word orders, while its performance on the generalization test does. These findings suggest that LMs exhibit some human-like inductive biases, though these biases are weaker than those found in human learners.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data diversity is crucial for the instruction tuning of large language models. Existing studies have explored various diversity-aware data selection methods to construct high-quality datasets and enhance model performance. However, the fundamental problem of precisely defining and measuring data diversity remains underexplored, limiting clear guidance for data engineering. To address this, we systematically analyze 11 existing diversity measurement methods by evaluating their correlation with model performance through extensive fine-tuning experiments. Our results indicate that a reliable diversity measure should properly account for both inter-sample differences and the information density in the sample space. Building on this, we propose NovelSum, a new diversity metric based on sample-level "novelty." Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that NovelSum accurately captures diversity variations and achieves a 0.97 correlation with instruction-tuned model performance, highlighting its value in guiding data engineering practices. With NovelSum as an optimization objective, we further develop a greedy, diversity-oriented data selection strategy that outperforms existing approaches, validating both the effectiveness and practical significance of our metric.

  Scientific communication is receiving increasing attention in natural language processing, especially to help researches access, summarize, and generate content. One emerging application in this area is Speech-to-Abstract Generation (SAG), which aims to automatically generate abstracts from recorded scientific presentations. SAG enables researchers to efficiently engage with conference talks, but progress has been limited by a lack of large-scale datasets. To address this gap, we introduce NUTSHELL, a novel multimodal dataset of *ACL conference talks paired with their corresponding abstracts. We establish strong baselines for SAG and evaluate the quality of generated abstracts using both automatic metrics and human judgments. Our results highlight the challenges of SAG and demonstrate the benefits of training on NUTSHELL. By releasing NUTSHELL under an open license (CC-BY 4.0), we aim to advance research in SAG and foster the development of improved models and evaluation methods.

  To compare autoregressive language models at scale, we propose using log-likelihood vectors computed on a predefined text set as model features. This approach has a solid theoretical basis: when treated as model coordinates, their squared Euclidean distance approximates the Kullback-Leibler divergence of text-generation probabilities. Our method is highly scalable, with computational cost growing linearly in both the number of models and text samples, and is easy to implement as the required features are derived from cross-entropy loss. Applying this method to over 1,000 language models, we constructed a "model map," providing a new perspective on large-scale model analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities at task-specific applications through fine-tuning, extending these benefits across diverse languages is essential for broad accessibility. However, effective cross-lingual transfer is hindered by LLM performance gaps across languages and the scarcity of fine-tuning data in many languages. Through analysis of LLM internal representations from over 1,000+ language pairs, we discover that middle layers exhibit the strongest potential for cross-lingual alignment. Building on this finding, we propose a middle-layer alignment objective integrated into task-specific training. Our experiments on slot filling, machine translation, and structured text generation show consistent improvements in cross-lingual transfer, especially to lower-resource languages. The method is robust to the choice of alignment languages and generalizes to languages unseen during alignment. Furthermore, we show that separately trained alignment modules can be merged with existing task-specific modules, improving cross-lingual capabilities without full re-training. Our code is publicly available (this https URL).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance in English, but their effectiveness in Japanese remains limited due to the lack of high-quality training data. Current Japanese LMMs often rely on translated English datasets, restricting their ability to capture Japan-specific cultural knowledge. To address this, we explore the potential of Japanese PDF data as a training resource, an area that remains largely underutilized. We introduce a fully automated pipeline that leverages pretrained models to extract image-text pairs from PDFs through layout analysis, OCR, and vision-language pairing, removing the need for manual annotation. Additionally, we construct instruction data from extracted image-text pairs to enrich the training data. To evaluate the effectiveness of PDF-derived data, we train Japanese LMMs and assess their performance on the Japanese LMM Benchmark. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements, with performance gains ranging from 2.1% to 13.8% on Heron-Bench. Further analysis highlights the impact of PDF-derived data on various factors, such as model size and language models, reinforcing its value as a multimodal resource for Japanese LMMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many sensitive domains -- such as the clinical domain -- lack widely available datasets due to privacy risks. The increasing generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made synthetic datasets a viable path forward. In this study, we domain-adapt LLMs to the clinical domain and generate synthetic clinical texts that are machine-annotated with tags for personally identifiable information using capable encoder-based NER models. The synthetic corpora are then used to train synthetic NER models. The results show that training NER models using synthetic corpora incurs only a small drop in predictive performance. The limits of this process are investigated in a systematic ablation study -- using both Swedish and Spanish data. Our analysis shows that smaller datasets can be sufficient for domain-adapting LLMs for data synthesis. Instead, the effectiveness of this process is almost entirely contingent on the performance of the machine-annotating NER models trained using the original data.

  With the rapid emergence of novel capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), the need for rigorous multilingual and multicultural benchmarks that are integrated has become more pronounced. Though existing LLM benchmarks are capable of evaluating specific capabilities of LLMs in English as well as in various mid- to low-resource languages, including those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region, a comprehensive and culturally representative evaluation suite for the SEA languages has not been developed thus far. Here, we present SEA-HELM, a holistic linguistic and cultural LLM evaluation suite that emphasises SEA languages, comprising five core pillars: (1) NLP Classics, (2) LLM-specifics, (3) SEA Linguistics, (4) SEA Culture, (5) Safety. SEA-HELM currently supports Filipino, Indonesian, Tamil, Thai, and Vietnamese. We also introduce the SEA-HELM leaderboard, which allows users to understand models' multilingual and multicultural performance in a systematic and user-friendly manner.

  While the ability of language models to elicit facts has been widely investigated, how they handle temporally changing facts remains underexplored. We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads that primarily handle temporal knowledge, through circuit analysis. We confirm that these heads are present across multiple models, though their specific locations may vary, and their responses differ depending on the type of knowledge and its corresponding years. Disabling these heads degrades the model's ability to recall time-specific knowledge while maintaining its general capabilities without compromising time-invariant and question-answering performances. Moreover, the heads are activated not only numeric conditions ("In 2004") but also textual aliases ("In the year ..."), indicating that they encode a temporal dimension beyond simple numerical representation. Furthermore, we expand the potential of our findings by demonstrating how temporal knowledge can be edited by adjusting the values of these heads.

  Multiple choice question answering (MCQA) is popular for LLM evaluation due to its simplicity and human-like testing, but we argue for its reform. We first reveal flaws in MCQA's format, as it struggles to: 1) test generation/subjectivity; 2) match LLM use cases; and 3) fully test knowledge. We instead advocate for generative formats based on human testing, where LLMs construct and explain answers, better capturing user needs and knowledge while remaining easy to score. We then show even when MCQA is a useful format, its datasets suffer from: leakage; unanswerability; shortcuts; and saturation. In each issue, we give fixes from education, like rubrics to guide MCQ writing; scoring methods to bridle guessing; and Item Response Theory to build harder MCQs. Lastly, we discuss LLM errors in MCQA, robustness, biases, and unfaithful explanations, showing how our prior solutions better measure or address these issues. While we do not need to desert MCQA, we encourage more efforts in refining the task based on educational testing, advancing evaluations.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown great promise for knowledge-intensive tasks and recently advanced with agentic RAG, where language agents engage in multi-round interactions with external knowledge sources for adaptive information retrieval. However, existing agentic RAG methods often depend on ad-hoc prompt engineering and lack a unified optimization framework. We introduce RAG-Gym, a comprehensive platform that systematically explores three optimization dimensions: (1) prompt engineering, (2) actor tuning, and (3) critic training. For prompt engineering, we propose Re$^2$Search, a novel agent incorporating reasoning reflection that significantly outperforms standard prompts. In actor tuning, we evaluate three popular post-training algorithms with fine-grained process supervision and identify direct preference optimization as the most effective. We further demonstrate that a trained critic can enhance inference by selecting higher-quality intermediate reasoning steps. Together, these findings lead to the optimized Re$^2$Search++ agent, which surpasses most recent methods like Search-R1 by a relative increase of 3.2% to 11.6% in average F1. Finally, we examine the impact of different reward sources and analyze scaling properties in training and inference, offering practical insights for agentic RAG optimization.

  We introduce TESS 2, a general instruction-following diffusion language model that outperforms contemporary instruction-tuned diffusion models, as well as matches and sometimes exceeds strong autoregressive (AR) models. We train TESS 2 by first adapting a strong AR model via continued pretraining with the usual cross-entropy as diffusion loss, and then performing further instruction tuning. We find that adaptation training as well as the choice of the base model is crucial for training good instruction-following diffusion models. We further propose reward guidance, a novel and modular inference-time guidance procedure to align model outputs without needing to train the underlying model. Finally, we show that TESS 2 further improves with increased inference-time compute, highlighting the utility of diffusion LMs in having fine-grained controllability over the amount of compute used at inference time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Alignment techniques have become central to ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate outputs consistent with human values. However, existing alignment paradigms often model an averaged or monolithic preference, failing to account for the diversity of perspectives across cultures, demographics, and communities. This limitation is particularly critical in health-related scenarios, where plurality is essential due to the influence of culture, religion, personal values, and conflicting opinions. Despite progress in pluralistic alignment, no prior work has focused on health, likely due to the unavailability of publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a new benchmark dataset comprising 13.1K value-laden situations and 5.4K multiple-choice questions focused on health, designed to assess and benchmark pluralistic alignment methodologies. Through extensive evaluation of eight LLMs of varying sizes, we demonstrate that existing pluralistic alignment techniques fall short in effectively accommodating diverse healthcare beliefs, underscoring the need for tailored AI alignment in specific domains. This work highlights the limitations of current approaches and lays the groundwork for developing health-specific alignment solutions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Since the adoption of large language models (LLMs) for text evaluation has become increasingly prevalent in the field of natural language processing (NLP), a series of existing works attempt to optimize the prompts for LLM evaluators to improve their alignment with human judgment. However, their efforts are limited to optimizing individual factors of evaluation prompts, such as evaluation criteria or output formats, neglecting the combinatorial impact of multiple factors, which leads to insufficient optimization of the evaluation pipeline. Nevertheless, identifying well-behaved prompting strategies for adjusting multiple factors requires extensive enumeration. To this end, we comprehensively integrate 8 key factors for evaluation prompts and propose a novel automatic prompting strategy optimization method called Heuristic Prompting Strategy Search (HPSS). Inspired by the genetic algorithm, HPSS conducts an iterative search to find well-behaved prompting strategies for LLM evaluators. A heuristic function is employed to guide the search process, enhancing the performance of our algorithm. Extensive experiments across four evaluation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of HPSS, consistently outperforming both human-designed evaluation prompts and existing automatic prompt optimization methods.

  We study word learning in subword and character language models with the psycholinguistic lexical decision task. While subword LMs struggle to discern words and non-words with high accuracy, character LMs solve this task easily and consistently. Only when supplied with further contexts do subword LMs perform similarly to character models. Additionally, when looking at word-level and syntactic learning trajectories, we find that both processes are separable in character LMs. Word learning happens before syntactic learning, whereas both occur simultaneously in subword LMs. This raises questions about the adequacy of subword LMs for modeling language acquisition and positions character LMs as a viable alternative to study processes below the syntactic level.

  Inverse tasks can uncover potential reasoning gaps as Large Language Models (LLMs) scale up. In this work, we explore the redefinition task, in which we assign alternative values to well-known physical constants and units of measure, prompting LLMs to respond accordingly. Our findings show that not only does model performance degrade with scale, but its false confidence also rises. Moreover, while factors such as prompting strategies or response formatting are influential, they do not preclude LLMs from anchoring to memorized values.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding optimizes output selection by maximizing the expected utility value of an underlying human distribution. While prior work has shown the effectiveness of MBR decoding through empirical evaluation, few studies have analytically investigated why the method is effective. As a result of our analysis, we show that, given the size $n$ of the reference hypothesis set used in computation, MBR decoding approaches the optimal solution with high probability at a rate of $O\left(n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, under certain assumptions, even though the language space $Y$ is significantly larger $|Y|\gg n$. This result helps to theoretically explain the strong performance observed in several prior empirical studies on MBR decoding. In addition, we provide the performance gap for maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding and compare it to MBR decoding. The result of this paper indicates that MBR decoding tends to converge to the optimal solution faster than MAP decoding in several cases.

  Understanding pragmatics-the use of language in context-is crucial for developing NLP systems capable of interpreting nuanced language use. Despite recent advances in language technologies, including large language models, evaluating their ability to handle pragmatic phenomena such as implicatures and references remains challenging. To advance pragmatic abilities in models, it is essential to understand current evaluation trends and identify existing limitations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of resources designed for evaluating pragmatic capabilities in NLP, categorizing datasets by the pragmatics phenomena they address.

  _Kwangwook Seo, Donguk Kwon, Dongha Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in table-based reasoning have expanded beyond factoid-level QA to address insight-level tasks, where systems should synthesize implicit knowledge in the table to provide explainable analyses. Although effective, existing studies remain confined to scenarios where a single gold table is given alongside the user query, failing to address cases where users seek comprehensive insights from multiple unknown tables. To bridge these gaps, we propose MT-RAIG Bench, design to evaluate systems on Retrieval-Augmented Insight Generation over Mulitple-Tables. Additionally, to tackle the suboptimality of existing automatic evaluation methods in the table domain, we further introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework MT-RAIG Eval, which achieves better alignment with human quality judgments on the generated insights. We conduct extensive experiments and reveal that even frontier LLMs still struggle with complex multi-table reasoning, establishing our MT-RAIG Bench as a challenging testbed for future research.

  Data augmentation is an essential technique in natural language processing (NLP) for enriching training datasets by generating diverse samples. This process is crucial for improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of NLP models. However, a significant challenge remains: \textit{Insufficient Attention to Sample Distribution Diversity}. Most existing methods focus on increasing the sample numbers while neglecting the sample distribution diversity, which can lead to model overfitting. In response, we explore data augmentation's impact on dataset diversity and propose a \textbf{\underline{D}}iversity-\textbf{\underline{o}}riented data \textbf{\underline{Aug}}mentation framework (\textbf{DoAug}). % \(\mathscr{DoAug}\) Specifically, we utilize a diversity-oriented fine-tuning approach to train an LLM as a diverse paraphraser, which is capable of augmenting textual datasets by generating diversified paraphrases. Then, we apply the LLM paraphraser to a selected coreset of highly informative samples and integrate the paraphrases with the original data to create a more diverse augmented dataset. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world textual datasets. The results show that our fine-tuned LLM augmenter improves diversity while preserving label consistency, thereby enhancing the robustness and performance of downstream tasks. Specifically, it achieves an average performance gain of \(10.52\%\), surpassing the runner-up baseline with more than three percentage points.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work in computational psycholinguistics has revealed intriguing parallels between attention mechanisms and human memory retrieval, focusing primarily on vanilla Transformers that operate on token-level representations. However, computational psycholinguistic research has also established that syntactic structures provide compelling explanations for human sentence processing that token-level factors cannot fully account for. In this paper, we investigate whether the attention mechanism of Transformer Grammar (TG), which uniquely operates on syntactic structures as representational units, can serve as a cognitive model of human memory retrieval, using Normalized Attention Entropy (NAE) as a linking hypothesis between models and humans. Our experiments demonstrate that TG's attention achieves superior predictive power for self-paced reading times compared to vanilla Transformer's, with further analyses revealing independent contributions from both models. These findings suggest that human sentence processing involves dual memory representations -- one based on syntactic structures and another on token sequences -- with attention serving as the general memory retrieval algorithm, while highlighting the importance of incorporating syntactic structures as representational units.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized dialogue systems have advanced considerably with the integration of user-specific personas into large language models (LLMs). However, while LLMs can effectively generate personalized responses, the influence of persona sentiment on dialogue quality remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale analysis of dialogues generated using a range of polarized user profiles. Our experiments reveal that dialogues involving negatively polarized users tend to overemphasize persona attributes. In contrast, positively polarized profiles yield dialogues that selectively incorporate persona information, resulting in smoother interactions. Furthermore, we find that personas with weak or neutral sentiment generally produce lower-quality dialogues. Motivated by these findings, we propose a dialogue generation approach that explicitly accounts for persona polarity by combining a turn-based generation strategy with a profile ordering mechanism and sentiment-aware prompting. Our study provides new insights into the sensitivity of LLMs to persona sentiment and offers guidance for developing more robust and nuanced personalized dialogue systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The paper explores the performance of LLMs in the context of multi-dimensional analytic writing assessments, i.e. their ability to provide both scores and comments based on multiple assessment criteria. Using a corpus of literature reviews written by L2 graduate students and assessed by human experts against 9 analytic criteria, we prompt several popular LLMs to perform the same task under various conditions. To evaluate the quality of feedback comments, we apply a novel feedback comment quality evaluation framework. This framework is interpretable, cost-efficient, scalable, and reproducible, compared to existing methods that rely on manual judgments. We find that LLMs can generate reasonably good and generally reliable multi-dimensional analytic assessments. We release our corpus and code for reproducibility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite near-perfect results reported in the literature, the effectiveness of model editing in real-world applications remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce QAEdit, a new benchmark aligned with widely used question answering (QA) datasets, and WILD, a task-agnostic evaluation framework designed to better reflect real-world usage of model editing. Our single editing experiments show that current editing methods perform substantially worse than previously reported (38.5% vs. 96.8%). We demonstrate that it stems from issues in the synthetic evaluation practices of prior work. Among them, the most severe is the use of teacher forcing during testing, which leaks both content and length of the ground truth, leading to overestimated performance. Furthermore, we simulate practical deployment by sequential editing, revealing that current approaches fail drastically with only 1000 edits. This work calls for a shift in model editing research toward rigorous evaluation and the development of robust, scalable methods that can reliably update knowledge in LLMs for real-world use.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings. Code is available atthis https URL

  Mental health is increasingly critical in contemporary healthcare, with psychotherapy demanding dynamic, context-sensitive interactions that traditional NLP methods struggle to capture. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential for addressing this gap due to their ability to handle extensive context and multi-turn reasoning. This review introduces a conceptual taxonomy dividing psychotherapy into interconnected stages--assessment, diagnosis, and treatment--to systematically examine LLM advancements and challenges. Our comprehensive analysis reveals imbalances in current research, such as a focus on common disorders, linguistic biases, fragmented methods, and limited theoretical integration. We identify critical challenges including capturing dynamic symptom fluctuations, overcoming linguistic and cultural biases, and ensuring diagnostic reliability. Highlighting future directions, we advocate for continuous multi-stage modeling, real-time adaptive systems grounded in psychological theory, and diversified research covering broader mental disorders and therapeutic approaches, aiming toward more holistic and clinically integrated psychotherapy LLMs systems.

  _Beatrix M. G. Nielsen, Iuri Macocco, Marco Baroni_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hubness, the tendency for a few points to be among the nearest neighbours of a disproportionate number of other points, commonly arises when applying standard distance measures to high-dimensional data, often negatively impacting distance-based analysis. As autoregressive large language models (LLMs) operate on high-dimensional representations, we ask whether they are also affected by hubness. We first prove that the only large-scale representation comparison operation performed by LLMs, namely that between context and unembedding vectors to determine continuation probabilities, is not characterized by the concentration of distances phenomenon that typically causes the appearance of nuisance hubness. We then empirically show that this comparison still leads to a high degree of hubness, but the hubs in this case do not constitute a disturbance. They are rather the result of context-modulated frequent tokens often appearing in the pool of likely candidates for next token prediction. However, when other distances are used to compare LLM representations, we do not have the same theoretical guarantees, and, indeed, we see nuisance hubs appear. There are two main takeaways. First, hubness, while omnipresent in high-dimensional spaces, is not a negative property that needs to be mitigated when LLMs are being used for next token prediction. Second, when comparing representations from LLMs using Euclidean or cosine distance, there is a high risk of nuisance hubs and practitioners should use mitigation techniques if relevant.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While ChatGPT and GPT-based models are able to effectively perform many tasks without additional fine-tuning, they struggle with tasks related to extremely low-resource languages and indigenous languages. Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR), a semantic representation designed to capture the meaning of texts in many languages, is well-positioned to be leveraged in the development of low-resource language technologies. In this work, we explore the downstream utility of UMR for low-resource languages by incorporating it into GPT-4 prompts. Specifically, we examine the ability of GPT-4 to perform translation from three indigenous languages (Navajo, Ar√°paho, and Kukama), with and without demonstrations, as well as with and without UMR annotations. Ultimately, we find that in the majority of our test cases, integrating UMR into the prompt results in a statistically significant increase in performance, which is a promising indication of future applications of the UMR formalism.

  Mitigating positional bias of language models (LMs) for listwise inputs is a well-known and important problem (e.g., lost-in-the-middle). While zero-shot order-invariant LMs have been proposed to solve this issue, their success on practical listwise problems has been limited. In this work, as a first contribution, we identify and overcome two limitations to make zero-shot invariant LMs more practical: (1) training and inference distribution mismatch arising from modifying positional ID assignments to enforce invariance, and (2) failure to adapt to mixture of order-invariant and sensitive inputs in practical listwise problems. Then, to overcome these issues we propose (1) RoToR, a zero-shot invariant LM for genuinely order-invariant inputs with minimal modifications of positional IDs, and (2) Selective Routing, an adaptive framework that handles both order-invariant and order-sensitive inputs in listwise tasks. On the Lost in the middle (LitM), Knowledge Graph QA (KGQA), and MMLU benchmarks, we show that RoToR with Selective Routing can effectively handle practical listwise input tasks in a zero-shot manner (this https URL)

  Quality Estimation (QE) models for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) predict the quality of the hypothesis without having access to the reference. An emerging research direction in NMT involves the use of QE models, which have demonstrated high correlations with human judgment and can enhance translations through Quality-Aware Decoding. Although several approaches have been proposed based on sampling multiple candidate translations and picking the best candidate, none have integrated these models directly into the decoding process. In this paper, we address this by proposing a novel token-level QE model capable of reliably scoring partial translations. We build a uni-directional QE model for this, as decoder models are inherently trained and efficient on partial sequences. We then present a decoding strategy that integrates the QE model for Quality-Aware decoding and demonstrate that the translation quality improves when compared to the N-best list re-ranking with state-of-the-art QE models (up to $1.39$ XCOMET-XXL $\uparrow$). Finally, we show that our approach provides significant benefits in document translation tasks, where the quality of N-best lists is typically suboptimal.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP). However, its vast potential remains largely unexplored for graphs. This raises an interesting question: How can we design CoT prompting for graphs to guide graph models to learn step by step? On one hand, unlike natural languages, graphs are non-linear and characterized by complex topological structures. On the other hand, many graphs lack textual data, making it difficult to formulate language-based CoT prompting. In this work, we propose the first CoT prompt learning framework for text-free graphs, GCoT. Specifically, we decompose the adaptation process for each downstream task into a series of inference steps, with each step consisting of prompt-based inference, ``thought'' generation, and thought-conditioned prompt learning. While the steps mimic CoT prompting in NLP, the exact mechanism differs significantly. Specifically, at each step, an input graph, along with a prompt, is first fed into a pre-trained graph encoder for prompt-based inference. We then aggregate the hidden layers of the encoder to construct a ``thought'', which captures the working state of each node in the current step. Conditioned on this thought, we learn a prompt specific to each node based on the current state. These prompts are fed into the next inference step, repeating the cycle. To evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of GCoT, we conduct comprehensive experiments on eight public datasets, which demonstrate the advantage of our approach.

  Humans naturally interpret numbers non-literally, effortlessly combining context, world knowledge, and speaker intent. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) interpret numbers similarly, focusing on hyperbole and pragmatic halo effects. Through systematic comparison with human data and computational models of pragmatic reasoning, we find that LLMs diverge from human interpretation in striking ways. By decomposing pragmatic reasoning into testable components, grounded in the Rational Speech Act framework, we pinpoint where LLM processing diverges from human cognition -- not in prior knowledge, but in reasoning with it. This insight leads us to develop a targeted solution -- chain-of-thought prompting inspired by an RSA model makes LLMs' interpretations more human-like. Our work demonstrates how computational cognitive models can both diagnose AI-human differences and guide development of more human-like language understanding capabilities.

  Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced human language understanding and generation, with pretraining data quality and organization being crucial to their performance. Multi-stage pretraining is a promising approach, but existing methods often lack quantitative criteria for data partitioning and instead rely on intuitive heuristics. In this paper, we propose the novel Four-quadRAnt Multi-stage prEtraining strategy (FRAME), guided by the established principle of organizing the pretraining process into four stages to achieve significant loss reductions four times. This principle is grounded in two key findings: first, training on high Perplexity (PPL) data followed by low PPL data, and second, training on low PPL difference (PD) data followed by high PD data, both causing the loss to drop significantly twice and performance enhancements. By partitioning data into four quadrants and strategically organizing them, FRAME achieves a remarkable 16.8% average improvement over random across MMLU and CMMLU for the 3B model, effectively boosting LLM performance.

  Recent reasoning models, such as OpenAI's O1 series, have demonstrated exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks and revealed new test-time scaling laws. Inspired by this, many people have been studying how to train models to achieve effective self-evaluation and self-correction to further enable the scaling paradigm. However, less studied is how to efficiently scale test-time compute from a fixed model, and this remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by focusing on enhancing the quality of self-reflection data generation for complex problem-solving at test time, which can also subsequently improve the training of next-generation large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we explore how systematically triggering a model's self-correction mechanisms can improve performance on challenging reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose a novel iterative deepening sampling algorithm framework designed to enhance self-correction and generate higher-quality samples. Through extensive experiments on Math500 and AIME benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success rate on difficult tasks and provide detailed ablation studies to analyze its effectiveness across diverse settings.

  Large language models possess general linguistic abilities but acquire language less efficiently than humans. This study proposes a method for integrating the developmental characteristics of working memory during the critical period, a stage when human language acquisition is particularly efficient, into the training process of language models. The proposed method introduces a mechanism that initially constrains working memory during the early stages of training and gradually relaxes this constraint in an exponential manner as learning progresses. Targeted syntactic evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods without memory constraints or with static memory constraints. These findings not only provide new directions for designing data-efficient language models but also offer indirect evidence supporting the role of the developmental characteristics of working memory as the underlying mechanism of the critical period in language acquisition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The autoregressive decoding for text generation in large language models (LLMs), while widely used, is inherently suboptimal due to the lack of a built-in mechanism to perform refinement and/or correction of the generated content. In this paper, we consider optimality in terms of the joint probability over the generated response, when jointly considering all tokens at the same time. We theoretically characterize the potential deviation of the autoregressively generated response from its globally optimal counterpart that is of the same length. Our analysis suggests that we need to be cautious when noticeable uncertainty arises during text generation, which may signal the sub-optimality of the generation history. To address the pitfall of autoregressive decoding for text generation, we propose an approach that incorporates a sliding reflection window and a pausing criterion, such that refinement and generation can be carried out interchangeably as the decoding proceeds. Our selective refinement framework strikes a balance between efficiency and optimality, and our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models are fully open-sourced.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable advancements in integrating different modalities, excelling in complex understanding and generation tasks. Despite their success, MLLMs remain vulnerable to conversational adversarial inputs, particularly negation arguments. This paper systematically evaluates state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse benchmarks, revealing significant performance drops when negation arguments are introduced to initially correct responses. Notably, we introduce the first benchmark GaslightingBench, specifically designed to evaluate the vulnerability of MLLMs to negation arguments. GaslightingBench consists of multiple-choice questions curated from existing datasets, along with generated negation prompts across 20 diverse categories. Throughout extensive evaluation, we find that proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrate better resilience compared to open-source counterparts like Qwen2-VL and LLaVA. However, all evaluated MLLMs struggle to maintain logical consistency under negation arguments during conversation. Our findings provide critical insights for improving the robustness of MLLMs against negation inputs, contributing to the development of more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human evaluation is the gold standard for evaluating text generation models. However, it is expensive. In order to fit budgetary constraints, a random subset of the test data is often chosen in practice for human evaluation. However, randomly selected data may not accurately represent test performance, making this approach economically inefficient for model comparison. Thus, in this work, we develop and analyze a suite of selectors to get the most informative datapoints for human evaluation, taking the evaluation costs into account. We show that selectors based on variance in automated metric scores, diversity in model outputs, or Item Response Theory outperform random selection. We further develop an approach to distill these selectors to the scenario where the model outputs are not yet available. In particular, we introduce source-based estimators, which predict item usefulness for human evaluation just based on the source texts. We demonstrate the efficacy of our selectors in two common NLG tasks, machine translation and summarization, and show that only $\sim$70\% of the test data is needed to produce the same evaluation result as the entire data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In designing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in education, creating plausible distractors is crucial for identifying students' misconceptions and gaps in knowledge and accurately assessing their understanding. However, prior studies on distractor generation have not paid sufficient attention to enhancing the difficulty of distractors, resulting in reduced effectiveness of MCQs. This study presents a pipeline for training a model to generate distractors that are more likely to be selected by students. First, we train a pairwise ranker to reason about students' misconceptions and assess the relative plausibility of two distractors. Using this model, we create a dataset of pairwise distractor ranks and then train a distractor generator via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate more plausible distractors. Experiments on computer science subjects (Python, DB, MLDL) demonstrate that our pairwise ranker effectively identifies students' potential misunderstandings and achieves ranking accuracy comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our distractor generator outperforms several baselines in generating plausible distractors and produces questions with a higher item discrimination index (DI).

  LLMs are aligned to follow input instructions by learning which of two responses users prefer for a prompt. However, such preference data do not convey why users prefer responses that are chosen or rejected, so LLMs trained on these datasets cannot tailor responses to varied user needs. To surface these parameters of personalization, we apply abductive reasoning to preference data, inferring needs and interests of users, i.e., personas, that may prefer either response. We test this idea in two steps: Persona Inference (PI), abductively inferring personas of users who prefer chosen or rejected outputs, and Persona Tailoring (PT), training models to tailor outputs to personas from PI. We show: 1) LLMs infer personas accurately explaining why different users may prefer both chosen or rejected outputs; 2) Training on preference data augmented with PI personas via PT boosts personalization and generalizes to supporting user-written personas; and 3) Rejected response personas form harder personalization evaluations, showing PT better aids users with uncommon preferences versus typical alignment methods. We argue for an abductive view of preferences for personalization, asking not only which response is better but when, why, and for whom.

  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, but often at the cost of reduced output diversity. This trade-off between diversity and alignment quality remains a significant challenge. Drawing inspiration from curiosity-driven exploration in reinforcement learning, we introduce curiosity-driven RLHF (CD-RLHF), a framework that incorporates intrinsic rewards for novel states, alongside traditional sparse extrinsic rewards, to optimize both output diversity and alignment quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CD-RLHF through extensive experiments on a range of tasks, including text summarization and instruction following. Our approach achieves significant gains in diversity on multiple diversity-oriented metrics while maintaining alignment with human preferences comparable to standard RLHF.

  _Bennett Kleinberg, Riccardo Loconte, Bruno Verschuere_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background: Deception detection through analysing language is a promising avenue using both human judgments and automated machine learning judgments. For both forms of credibility assessment, automated adversarial attacks that rewrite deceptive statements to appear truthful pose a serious threat. Methods: We used a dataset of 243 truthful and 262 fabricated autobiographical stories in a deception detection task for humans and machine learning models. A large language model was tasked to rewrite deceptive statements so that they appear truthful. In Study 1, humans who made a deception judgment or used the detailedness heuristic and two machine learning models (a fine-tuned language model and a simple n-gram model) judged original or adversarial modifications of deceptive statements. In Study 2, we manipulated the target alignment of the modifications, i.e. tailoring the attack to whether the statements would be assessed by humans or computer models. Results: When adversarial modifications were aligned with their target, human (d=-0.07 and d=-0.04) and machine judgments (51% accuracy) dropped to the chance level. When the attack was not aligned with the target, both human heuristics judgments (d=0.30 and d=0.36) and machine learning predictions (63-78%) were significantly better than chance. Conclusions: Easily accessible language models can effectively help anyone fake deception detection efforts both by humans and machine learning models. Robustness against adversarial modifications for humans and machines depends on that target alignment. We close with suggestions on advancing deception research with adversarial attack designs and techniques.

  It is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions that involve multiple constraints. However, it is an unexplored area to enhance LLMs' ability to follow soft constraints. To bridge the gap, we initially design a pipeline to construct datasets with high-quality outputs automatically. Additionally, to fully utilize the positive and negative samples generated during the data construction process, we choose Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as the training method. Furthermore, taking into account the difficulty of soft constraints indicated by the number of constraints, we design a curriculum learning training paradigm based on the constraint quantity. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our methods in improving LLMs' soft constraint following ability and analyze the factors driving thethis http URLdatasets and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents ICAT, an evaluation framework for measuring coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. ICAT breaks down a long output text into a list of atomic claims and not only verifies each claim through retrieval from a (reliable) knowledge source, but also computes the alignment between the atomic factual claims and various aspects expected to be presented in the output. We study three implementations of the ICAT framework, each with a different assumption on the availability of aspects and alignment method. By adopting data from the diversification task in the TREC Web Track and the ClueWeb corpus, we evaluate the ICAT framework. We demonstrate strong correlation with human judgments and provide comprehensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our framework further offers interpretable and fine-grained analysis of diversity and coverage. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to different domains and datasets, making it a valuable tool for evaluating the qualitative aspects of long-form responses produced by LLMs.

  Large language models hold promise for addressing medical challenges, such as medical diagnosis reasoning, research knowledge acquisition, clinical decision-making, and consumer health inquiry support. However, they often generate hallucinations due to limited medical knowledge. Incorporating external knowledge is therefore critical, which necessitates multi-source knowledge acquisition. We address this challenge by framing it as a source planning problem, which is to formulate context-appropriate queries tailored to the attributes of diverse sources. Existing approaches either overlook source planning or fail to achieve it effectively due to misalignment between the model's expectation of the sources and their actual content. To bridge this gap, we present MedOmniKB, a repository comprising multigenre and multi-structured medical knowledge sources. Leveraging these sources, we propose the Source Planning Optimisation method, which enhances multi-source utilisation. Our approach involves enabling an expert model to explore and evaluate potential plans while training a smaller model to learn source alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves multi-source planning performance, enabling the optimised small model to achieve state-of-the-art results in leveraging diverse medical knowledge sources.

  _Yachao Zhao, Bo Wang, Yan Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit various biases and stereotypes in their generated content. While extensive research has investigated biases in LLMs, prior work has predominantly focused on explicit bias, with minimal attention to implicit bias and the relation between these two forms of bias. This paper presents a systematic framework grounded in social psychology theories to investigate and compare explicit and implicit biases in LLMs. We propose a novel self-reflection-based evaluation framework that operates in two phases: first measuring implicit bias through simulated psychological assessment methods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting LLMs to analyze their own generated content. Through extensive experiments on advanced LLMs across multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a substantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases: while explicit bias manifests as mild stereotypes, implicit bias exhibits strong stereotypes. We further investigate the underlying factors contributing to this explicit-implicit bias inconsistency, examining the effects of training data scale, model size, and alignment techniques. Experimental results indicate that while explicit bias declines with increased training data and model size, implicit bias exhibits a contrasting upward trend. Moreover, contemporary alignment methods effectively suppress explicit bias but show limited efficacy in mitigating implicit bias.

  As large language models (LLMs) evolve, their ability to deliver personalized and context-aware responses offers transformative potential for improving user experiences. Existing personalization approaches, however, often rely solely on user history to augment the prompt, limiting their effectiveness in generating tailored outputs, especially in cold-start scenarios with sparse data. To address these limitations, we propose Personalized Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PGraphRAG), a framework that leverages user-centric knowledge graphs to enrich personalization. By directly integrating structured user knowledge into the retrieval process and augmenting prompts with user-relevant context, PGraphRAG enhances contextual understanding and output quality. We also introduce the Personalized Graph-based Benchmark for Text Generation, designed to evaluate personalized text generation tasks in real-world settings where user history is sparse or unavailable. Experimental results show that PGraphRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalization methods across diverse tasks, demonstrating the unique advantages of graph-based retrieval for personalization.

  Interpreting the law is always essential for the law to adapt to the ever-changing society. It is a critical and challenging task even for legal practitioners, as it requires meticulous and professional annotations and summarizations by legal experts, which are admittedly time-consuming and expensive to collect at scale. To alleviate the burden on legal experts, we propose a method for automated legal interpretation. Specifically, by emulating doctrinal legal research, we introduce a novel framework, ATRIE, to address Legal Concept Interpretation, a typical task in legal interpretation. ATRIE utilizes large language models (LLMs) to AuTomatically Retrieve concept-related information, Interpret legal concepts, and Evaluate generated interpretations, eliminating dependence on legal experts. ATRIE comprises a legal concept interpreter and a legal concept interpretation evaluator. The interpreter uses LLMs to retrieve relevant information from previous cases and interpret legal concepts. The evaluator uses performance changes on Legal Concept Entailment, a downstream task we propose, as a proxy of interpretation quality. Automated and multifaceted human evaluations indicate that the quality of our interpretations is comparable to those written by legal experts, with superior comprehensiveness and readability. Although there remains a slight gap in accuracy, it can already assist legal practitioners in improving the efficiency of legal interpretation.

  Existing Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs), encapsulating extensive medical knowledge, demonstrate excellent capabilities in understanding medical images. However, there remain challenges in visual localization in medical images, which is crucial for abnormality detection and interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a novel UMed-LVLM designed to unveil medical abnormalities. Specifically, we collect a Medical Abnormalities Unveiling (MAU) dataset and propose a two-stage training method for UMed-LVLM training. To collect MAU dataset, we propose a prompt method utilizing the GPT-4V to generate diagnoses based on identified abnormal areas in medical images. Moreover, the two-stage training method includes Abnormal-Aware Instruction Tuning and Abnormal-Aware Rewarding, comprising Relevance Reward, Abnormal Localization Reward and Vision Relevance Reward. Experimental results demonstrate that our UMed-LVLM significantly outperforms existing Med-LVLMs in identifying and understanding medical abnormalities, achieving a 58% improvement over the baseline. In addition, this work shows that enhancing the abnormality detection capabilities of Med-LVLMs significantly improves their understanding of medical images and generalization capability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In psychological practices, standardized questionnaires serve as essential tools for assessing mental health through structured, clinically-validated questions (i.e., items). While social media platforms offer rich data for mental health screening, computational approaches often bypass these established clinical assessment tools in favor of black-box classification. We propose a novel questionnaire-guided screening framework that bridges psychological practice and computational methods through adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (\textit{aRAG}). Our approach links unstructured social media content and standardized clinical assessments by retrieving relevant posts for each questionnaire item and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to complete validated psychological instruments. Our findings demonstrate two key advantages of questionnaire-guided screening: First, when completing the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance on Reddit-based benchmarks without requiring training data. Second, we show that guiding LLMs through standardized questionnaires can yield superior results compared to directly prompting them for depression screening, while also providing a more interpretable assessment by linking model outputs to clinically validated diagnostic criteria. Additionally, we show, as a proof-of-concept, how our questionnaire-based methodology can be extended to other mental conditions' screening, highlighting the promising role of LLMs as psychological assessors.

  Transformers, as the fundamental deep learning architecture, have demonstrated great capability in reasoning. This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers outperform previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on the reasoning capability of transformers. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose TEGA, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  No-resource languages - those with minimal or no digital representation - pose unique challenges for machine translation (MT). Unlike low-resource languages, which rely on limited but existent corpora, no-resource languages often have fewer than 100 sentences available for training. This work explores the problem of no-resource translation through three distinct workflows: fine-tuning of translation-specific models, in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) using chain-of-reasoning prompting, and direct prompting without reasoning. Using Owens Valley Paiute as a case study, we demonstrate that no-resource translation demands fundamentally different approaches from low-resource scenarios, as traditional approaches to machine translation, such as those that work for low-resource languages, fail. Empirical results reveal that, although traditional approaches fail, the in-context learning capabilities of general-purpose large language models enable no-resource language translation that outperforms low-resource translation approaches and rivals human translations (BLEU 0.45-0.6); specifically, chain-of-reasoning prompting outperforms other methods for larger corpora, while direct prompting exhibits advantages in smaller datasets. As these approaches are language-agnostic, they have potential to be generalized to translation tasks from a wide variety of no-resource languages without expert input. These findings establish no-resource translation as a distinct paradigm requiring innovative solutions, providing practical and theoretical insights for language preservation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humblebragging is a phenomenon in which individuals present self-promotional statements under the guise of modesty or complaints. For example, a statement like, "Ugh, I can't believe I got promoted to lead the entire team. So stressful!", subtly highlights an achievement while pretending to be complaining. Detecting humblebragging is important for machines to better understand the nuances of human language, especially in tasks like sentiment analysis and intent recognition. However, this topic has not yet been studied in computational linguistics. For the first time, we introduce the task of automatically detecting humblebragging in text. We formalize the task by proposing a 4-tuple definition of humblebragging and evaluate machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) on this task, comparing their performance with humans. We also create and release a dataset called HB-24, containing 3,340 humblebrags generated using GPT-4o. Our experiments show that detecting humblebragging is non-trivial, even for humans. Our best model achieves an F1-score of 0.88. This work lays the foundation for further exploration of this nuanced linguistic phenomenon and its integration into broader natural language understanding systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the number of reasoning tokens based on the reasoning complexity of each problem. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

  Multiword expressions (MWEs) refer to idiomatic sequences of multiple words. MWE identification, i.e., detecting MWEs in text, can play a key role in downstream tasks such as machine translation, but existing datasets for the task are inconsistently annotated, limited to a single type of MWE, or limited in size. To enable reliable and comprehensive evaluation, we created CoAM: Corpus of All-Type Multiword Expressions, a dataset of 1.3K sentences constructed through a multi-step process to enhance data quality consisting of human annotation, human review, and automated consistency checking. Additionally, for the first time in a dataset of MWE identification, CoAM's MWEs are tagged with MWE types, such as Noun and Verb, enabling fine-grained error analysis. Annotations for CoAM were collected using a new interface created with our interface generator, which allows easy and flexible annotation of MWEs in any form. Through experiments using CoAM, we find that a fine-tuned large language model outperforms MWEasWSD, which achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the DiMSUM dataset. Furthermore, analysis using our MWE type tagged data reveals that Verb MWEs are easier than Noun MWEs to identify across approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cognitive tasks originally developed for humans are now increasingly used to study language models. While applying these tasks is often straightforward, interpreting their results can be challenging. In particular, when a model underperforms, it is often unclear whether this results from a limitation in the cognitive ability being tested or a failure to understand the task itself. A recent study argues that GPT 3.5's declining performance on 2-back and 3-back tasks reflects a working memory capacity limit similar to humans (Gong et al., 2024). By analyzing a range of open-source language models of varying performance levels on these tasks, we show that the poor performance is due at least in part to a limitation in task comprehension and task set maintenance. We challenge the best-performing model with progressively harder versions of the task (up to 10-back) and experiment with alternative prompting strategies, before analyzing model attentions. Our larger aim is to contribute to the ongoing conversation around refining methodologies for the cognitive evaluation of language models.

  Large language models can generate factually inaccurate content, a problem known as hallucination. Recent works have built upon retrieved-augmented generation to improve factuality through iterative prompting but these methods are limited by the traditional RAG design. To address these challenges, we introduce EWE (Explicit Working Memory), a novel approach that enhances factuality in long-form text generation by integrating a working memory that receives real-time feedback from external resources. The memory is refreshed based on online fact-checking and retrieval feedback, allowing EWE to rectify false claims during the generation process and ensure more accurate and reliable outputs. Our experiments demonstrate that Ewe outperforms strong baselines on four fact-seeking long-form generation datasets, increasing the factuality metric, VeriScore, by 2 to 6 points absolute without sacrificing the helpfulness of the responses. Further analysis reveals that the design of rules for memory updates, configurations of memory units, and the quality of the retrieval datastore are crucial factors for influencing model performance.

  While feed-forward neurons in pre-trained language models (PLMs) can encode knowledge, past research targeted a small subset of neurons that heavily influence outputs. This leaves the broader role of neuron activations unclear, limiting progress in areas like knowledge editing. We uncover a global linear relationship between neuron activations and outputs using neuron interventions on a knowledge probing dataset. The gradient of this linear relationship, which we call the neuron empirical gradient (NEG), captures how changes in activations affect predictions. To compute NEG efficiently, we propose NeurGrad, enabling large-scale analysis of neuron behavior in PLMs. We also show that NEG effectively captures language skills across diverse prompts through skill neuron probing. Experiments on MCEval8k, a multi-genre multiple-choice knowledge benchmark, support NEG's ability to represent model knowledge. Further analysis highlights the key properties of NEG-based skill representation: efficiency, robustness, flexibility, and interdependency. The code and data are released.

  The rapid growth of social media platforms has raised significant concerns regarding online content toxicity. When Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for toxicity detection, two key challenges emerge: 1) the absence of domain-specific toxic knowledge leads to false negatives; 2) the excessive sensitivity of LLMs to toxic speech results in false positives, limiting freedom of speech. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called MetaTox, leveraging graph search on a meta-toxic knowledge graph to enhance hatred and toxicity detection. First, we construct a comprehensive meta-toxic knowledge graph by utilizing LLMs to extract toxic information through a three-step pipeline, with toxic benchmark datasets serving as corpora. Second, we query the graph via retrieval and ranking processes to supplement accurate, relevant toxic knowledge. Extensive experiments and in-depth case studies across multiple datasets demonstrate that our MetaTox significantly decreases the false positive rate while boosting overall toxicity detection performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent generative large language models (LLMs) show remarkable performance in non-English languages, but when prompted in those languages they tend to express higher harmful social biases and toxicity levels. Prior work has shown that finetuning on specialized datasets can mitigate this behavior, and doing so in English can transfer to other languages. In this work, we investigate the impact of different finetuning methods on the model's bias and toxicity, but also on its ability to produce fluent and diverse text. We reduce biases by finetuning on curated non-harmful text, but find only direct preference optimization to be effective for mitigating toxicity. The mitigation caused by applying these methods in English also transfers to non-English languages. We find evidence that the extent to which transfer takes place can be predicted by the amount of data in a given language present in the model's pretraining data. However, this transfer of bias and toxicity mitigation often comes at the expense of decreased language generation ability in non-English languages, highlighting the importance of developing language-specific bias and toxicity mitigation methods.

  Key-Value (KV) cache has become a bottleneck of LLMs for long-context generation. Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that demand complex reasoning. To track progress, robust benchmarks are required to evaluate their capabilities beyond superficial pattern recognition. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks often face challenges such as insufficient interpretability, performance saturation or data contamination. To address these challenges, we introduce GAMEBoT, a gaming arena designed for rigorous and transparent assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities. GAMEBoT decomposes complex reasoning in games into predefined modular subproblems. This decomposition allows us to design a suite of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that leverage domain knowledge to guide LLMs in addressing these subproblems before action selection. Furthermore, we develop a suite of rule-based algorithms to generate ground truth for these subproblems, enabling rigorous validation of the LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps. This approach facilitates evaluation of both the quality of final actions and the accuracy of the underlying reasoning process. GAMEBoT also naturally alleviates the risk of data contamination through dynamic games and head-to-head LLM competitions. We benchmark 17 prominent LLMs across eight games, encompassing various strategic abilities and game characteristics. Our results suggest that GAMEBoT presents a significant challenge, even when LLMs are provided with detailed CoT prompts. Project page:this https URL

  Detecting factual inconsistencies in summarization is critical, yet existing benchmarks lack the necessary challenge and interpretability for robust evaluation. In this paper, we introduce SummExecEdit, a novel pipeline and benchmark leveraging executable edits to assess models on their ability to both detect factual errors and provide accurate explanations. The top-performing model, Claude3-Opus, achieves a joint detection and explanation score of only 0.49 in our benchmark, with individual scores of 0.67 for detection and 0.73 for explanation. We conduct detailed evaluations to assess the current state of models in this field and find that more than half of the 20+ LLMs in our study struggle with over 30% of the SummExecEdit benchmark. Additionally, we identify four primary types of explanation errors, with 45.4% of them involving a focus on completely unrelated parts of the summary.

  In recent research, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to investigate public opinions. This study investigates the algorithmic fidelity of LLMs, i.e., the ability to replicate the socio-cultural context and nuanced opinions of human participants. Using open-ended survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Studies (GLES), we prompt different LLMs to generate synthetic public opinions reflective of German subpopulations by incorporating demographic features into the persona prompts. Our results show that Llama performs better than other LLMs at representing subpopulations, particularly when there is lower opinion diversity within those groups. Our findings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of left-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties, and matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the models' predictions. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLMs to more effectively model diverse public opinions while minimizing political biases and enhancing robustness in representativeness.

  Lexical semantic change detection aims to identify shifts in word meanings over time. While existing methods using embeddings from a diachronic corpus pair estimate the degree of change for target words, they offer limited insight into changes at the level of individual usage instances. To address this, we apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) to sets of contextualized word embeddings, capturing semantic change through the excess and deficit in the alignment between usage instances. In particular, we propose Sense Usage Shift (SUS), a measure that quantifies changes in the usage frequency of a word sense at each usage instance. By leveraging SUS, we demonstrate that several challenges in semantic change detection can be addressed in a unified manner, including quantifying instance-level semantic change and word-level tasks such as measuring the magnitude of semantic change and the broadening or narrowing of meaning.

  Autoregressive transformers exhibit adaptive learning through in-context learning (ICL), which begs the question of how. Prior works have shown that transformers represent the ICL tasks as vectors in their representations. In this paper, we leverage the encoding-decoding framework to study how transformers form task vectors during pretraining and how their task encoding quality predicts ICL task performance. On synthetic ICL tasks, we analyze the training dynamics of a small transformer and report the coupled emergence of task encoding and decoding. As the model learns to encode different latent tasks (e.g., "Finding the first noun in a sentence.") into distinct, separable representations, it concurrently builds conditional decoding algorithms and improves its ICL performance. We validate this phenomenon across pretrained models of varying scales (Gemma-2 2B/9B/27B, Llama-3.1 8B/70B) and over the course of pretraining in OLMo-7B. Further, we demonstrate that the quality of task encoding inferred from representations predicts ICL performance, and that, surprisingly, finetuning the earlier layers can improve the task encoding and performance more than finetuning the latter layers. Our empirical insights shed light into better understanding the success and failure modes of large language models via their representations.

- **[Inferring Functionality of Attention Heads from their Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11965)**  `arXiv:2412.11965`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attention heads are one of the building blocks of large language models (LLMs). Prior work on investigating their operation mostly focused on analyzing their behavior during inference for specific circuits or tasks. In this work, we seek a comprehensive mapping of the operations they implement in a model. We propose MAPS (Mapping Attention head ParameterS), an efficient framework that infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, without any model training or inference. We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head's outputs during inference and are causally linked to the model's predictions. Moreover, its mappings reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases in LLMs. Next, we present an automatic pipeline and analysis that leverage MAPS to characterize the salient operations of a given head. Our pipeline produces plausible operation descriptions for most heads, as assessed by human judgment, while revealing diverse operations.

  _Byung-Doh Oh, William Schuler_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Word-by-word language model surprisal is often used to model the incremental processing of human readers, which raises questions about how various choices in language modeling influence its predictive power. One factor that has been overlooked in cognitive modeling is the granularity of subword tokens, which explicitly encodes information about word length and frequency, and ultimately influences the quality of vector representations that are learned. This paper presents experiments that manipulate the token granularity and evaluate its impact on the ability of surprisal to account for processing difficulty of naturalistic text and garden-path constructions. Experiments with naturalistic reading times reveal a substantial influence of token granularity on surprisal, with tokens defined by a vocabulary size of 8,000 resulting in surprisal that is most predictive. In contrast, on garden-path constructions, language models trained on coarser-grained tokens generally assigned higher surprisal to critical regions, suggesting a greater sensitivity to garden-path effects than previously reported. Taken together, these results suggest a large role of token granularity on the quality of language model surprisal for cognitive modeling.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at answering questions but remain passive learners-absorbing static data without the ability to question and refine knowledge. This paper explores how LLMs can transition to interactive, question-driven learning through student-teacher dialogues. We introduce INTERACT (INTERactive learning for Adaptive Concept Transfer), a framework in which a "student" LLM engages a "teacher" LLM through iterative inquiries to acquire knowledge across 1,347 contexts, including song lyrics, news articles, movie plots, academic papers, and images. Our experiments show that across a wide range of scenarios and LLM architectures, interactive learning consistently enhances performance, achieving up to a 25% improvement, with 'cold-start' student models matching static learning baselines in as few as five dialogue turns. Interactive setups can also mitigate the disadvantages of weaker teachers, showcasing the robustness of question-driven learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce LLM-as-an-Interviewer, a novel paradigm for evaluating large language models (LLMs). This approach leverages multi-turn interactions where the LLM interviewer actively provides feedback on responses and poses follow-up questions to the evaluated LLM. At the start of the interview, the LLM interviewer dynamically modifies datasets to generate initial questions, mitigating data contamination. We apply the LLM-as-an-Interviewer framework to evaluate six models on the MATH and DepthQA tasks. Our results show that the framework effectively provides insights into LLM performance, including the quality of initial responses, adaptability to feedback, and ability to address follow-up queries like clarification or additional knowledge requests. The framework also addresses key limitations of conventional methods like LLM-as-a-Judge, including verbosity bias and inconsistency across runs. Finally, we propose the Interview Report, which aggregates insights from the interview process, providing examples and a comprehensive analysis of the LLM's strengths and weaknesses. This report offers a detailed snapshot of the model's real-world applicability. The code for our framework is publicly available atthis https URL.

  _Cassie Huang, Li Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models have been found to create plans that are neither executable nor verifiable in grounded environments. An emerging line of work demonstrates success in using the LLM as a formalizer to generate a formal representation of the planning domain in some language, such as Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). This formal representation can be deterministically solved to find a plan. We systematically evaluate this methodology while bridging some major gaps. While previous work only generates a partial PDDL representation, given templated, and therefore unrealistic environment descriptions, we generate the complete representation given descriptions of various naturalness levels. Among an array of observations critical to improve LLMs' formal planning abilities, we note that most large enough models can effectively formalize descriptions as PDDL, outperforming those directly generating plans, while being robust to lexical perturbation. As the descriptions become more natural-sounding, we observe a decrease in performance and provide detailed error analysis.

  _Tianshi Zheng, Weihan Li, Jiaxin Bai, Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show remarkable potential as question answering tools in the K-12 Education domain, where knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative textbooks. However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.

  _Aman Kassahun Wassie, Mahdi Molaei, Yasmin Moslem_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we compare the domain-specific translation performance of open-source autoregressive decoder-only large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented machine translation (MT) models. Our experiments focus on the medical domain and cover four language directions with varied resource availability: English-to-French, English-to-Portuguese, English-to-Swahili, and Swahili-to-English. Despite recent advancements, LLMs demonstrate a significant quality gap in specialized translation compared to multilingual encoder-decoder MT models such as NLLB-200. Our results indicate that NLLB-200 3.3B outperforms all evaluated LLMs in the 7-8B parameter range across three out of the four language directions. While fine-tuning improves the performance of LLMs such as Mistral and Llama, these models still underperform compared to fine-tuned NLLB-200 3.3B models. Our findings highlight the ongoing need for specialized MT models to achieve high-quality domain-specific translation, especially in medium-resource and low-resource settings. Moreover, the superior performance of larger LLMs over their 8B variants suggests potential value in pre-training domain-specific medium-sized language models, employing targeted data selection and knowledge distillation approaches to enhance both quality and efficiency in specialized translation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), a versatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed at enhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medical reasoning. RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have been well-researched in various long-context tasks. However, the scarcity of long-context summarization datasets hinders progress in this area. To address this, we introduce CNNSum, a multi-scale long-context summarization benchmark based on Chinese novels, featuring human-driven annotations across four subsets totaling 695 samples, with lengths ranging from 16k to 128k. We benchmark numerous LLMs and conduct detailed human assessments to summarize abnormal output types. Furthermore, we extensively explore how to improve long-context summarization. In our study: (1) Advanced LLMs may generate much subjective commentary, leading to vague summaries. (2) Currently, long-context summarization mainly relies on memory ability. The advantages of Large LLMs are hard to utilize, thus small LLMs are more cost-effective. (3) Different prompt types paired with various version models may cause large performance gaps. In further fine-tuning, these can be mitigated, and the Base version models perform better. (4) LLMs with RoPE-base scaled exhibit strong extrapolation potential; using short-context data can significantly improve long-context summarization performance. However, further applying other interpolation methods requires careful selection. (5) CNNSum provides more reliable evaluation results than other benchmarks. We release CNNSum to advance future research.(this https URL)

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent English Common Crawl datasets like FineWeb-Edu and DCLM achieved significant benchmark gains via aggressive model-based filtering, but at the cost of removing 90% of data. This limits their suitability for long token horizon training, such as 15T tokens for Llama 3.1. In this paper, we show how to achieve better trade-offs between accuracy and data quantity by a combination of classifier ensembling, synthetic data rephrasing, and reduced reliance on heuristic filters. When training 8B parameter models for 1T tokens, using a high-quality subset of our data improves MMLU by 5.6 over DCLM, demonstrating the efficacy of our methods for boosting accuracies over a relatively short token horizon. Furthermore, our full 6.3T token dataset matches DCLM on MMLU, but contains four times more unique real tokens than DCLM. This unlocks state-of-the-art training over a long token horizon: an 8B parameter model trained for 15T tokens, of which 7.2T came from our dataset, is better than the Llama 3.1 8B model: +5 on MMLU, +3.1 on ARC-Challenge, and +0.5 on average across ten diverse tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform downstream tasks through advanced prompting and high-quality demonstrations. However, traditional ICL paradigms encounter significant limitations in complex reasoning tasks, stemming primarily from their dependence on example quality and absence of explicit reasoning guidance. To address these challenges, we introduce HiAR-ICL, a **Hi**gh-level **A**utomated **R**easoning paradigm in **ICL** that shifts focus from specific examples to abstract reasoning patterns, thereby extending the conventional concept of "context" in ICL. Our approach begins by defining five atomic reasoning actions, upon which we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to systematically construct high-level reasoning patterns. During inference, HiAR-ICL dynamically selects appropriate reasoning patterns based on problem attributes, providing explicit guidance for the model's reasoning process. Experiments demonstrate HiAR-ICL's effectiveness and efficiency: utilizing only 200 prior samples with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, our method achieves 80.6% accuracy on MATH and 62.5% on AMC, exceeding GPT-4o's 77.2% and 57.5%. Our approach enhances performance across models of varying sizes while generalizing effectively across domains. Further analysis reveals that HiAR-ICL can also serve as a plug-and-play inference method compatible with post-training techniques like GRPO. Code and data are available atthis https URL.

  _Sohee Yang, Nora Kassner, Elena Gribovskaya, Sebastian Riedel, Mor Geva_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) latently recall and compose facts to answer multi-hop queries like "In the year Scarlett Johansson was born, the Summer Olympics were hosted in the country of". One major challenge in such evaluation is that LLMs may have developed shortcuts by encountering the head entity "Scarlett Johansson" and the answer entity "United States" in the same training sequences or merely guess the answer based on frequency-based priors. To prevent shortcuts, we exclude test queries where the head and answer entities might have co-appeared during training. Through careful selection of relations and facts and systematic removal of cases where models might guess answers or exploit partial matches, we construct an evaluation dataset SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning). We observe that LLMs demonstrate promising latent multi-hop reasoning abilities without exploiting shortcuts, but only for certain types of queries. For queries requiring latent recall of countries as the intermediate answer, the best models achieve 80% latent composability, but this drops to just 5% for the recall of years. Comparisons with Chain-of-Thought highlight a significant gap between the ability of models to reason latently versus explicitly. Analysis reveals that latent representations of the intermediate answer are constructed more often in queries with higher latent composability, and shows the emergence of latent multi-hop reasoning during pretraining.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To address the global challenge of online hate speech, prior research has developed detection models to flag such content on social media. However, due to systematic biases in evaluation datasets, the real-world effectiveness of these models remains unclear, particularly across geographies. We introduce HateDay, the first global hate speech dataset representative of social media settings, constructed from a random sample of all tweets posted on September 21, 2022 and covering eight languages and four English-speaking countries. Using HateDay, we uncover substantial variation in the prevalence and composition of hate speech across languages and regions. We show that evaluations on academic datasets greatly overestimate real-world detection performance, which we find is very low, especially for non-European languages. Our analysis identifies key drivers of this gap, including models' difficulty to distinguish hate from offensive speech and a mismatch between the target groups emphasized in academic datasets and those most frequently targeted in real-world settings. We argue that poor model performance makes public models ill-suited for automatic hate speech moderation and find that high moderation rates are only achievable with substantial human oversight. Our results underscore the need to evaluate detection systems on data that reflects the complexity and diversity of real-world social media.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Topic modeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing, allowing the discovery of latent thematic structures in text corpora. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in topic discovery, their direct application to topic modeling suffers from issues such as incomplete topic coverage, misalignment of topics, and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-ITL, a novel LLM-in-the-loop framework that integrates LLMs with Neural Topic Models (NTMs). In LLM-ITL, global topics and document representations are learned through the NTM. Meanwhile, an LLM refines these topics using an Optimal Transport (OT)-based alignment objective, where the refinement is dynamically adjusted based on the LLM's confidence in suggesting topical words for each set of input words. With the flexibility of being integrated into many existing NTMs, the proposed approach enhances the interpretability of topics while preserving the efficiency of NTMs in learning topics and document representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-ITL helps NTMs significantly improve their topic interpretability while maintaining the quality of document representation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capability in language generation and understanding, but their tendency to hallucinate and produce factually incorrect information remains a key limitation. To verify LLM-generated contents and claims from other sources, traditional verification approaches often rely on holistic models that assign a single factuality label to complex claims, potentially obscuring nuanced errors. In this paper, we advocate for a shift towards fine-grained verification, where complex claims are broken down into smaller sub-claims for individual verification, allowing for more precise identification of inaccuracies, improved transparency, and reduced ambiguity in evidence retrieval. However, generating sub-claims poses challenges, such as maintaining context and ensuring semantic equivalence with respect to the original claim. We introduce FactLens, a benchmark for evaluating fine-grained fact verification, with metrics and automated evaluators of sub-claim quality. The benchmark data is manually curated to ensure high-quality ground truth. Our results show alignment between automated FactLens evaluators and human judgments, and we discuss the impact of sub-claim characteristics on the overall verification performance.

  Empirical evidence indicates that LLMs exhibit spontaneous cross-lingual alignment. However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in Information Extraction (IE), a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal IE. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we conduct IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on the translated instance prediction task to enhance the model's cross-lingual transferability. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages, KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by 30.17\% and SoTA by 20.03\%, thereby demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through boosting the IE alignment.

  Speech translation for Indian languages remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of large-scale, publicly available datasets that capture the linguistic diversity and domain coverage essential for real-world applications. Existing datasets cover a fraction of Indian languages and lack the breadth needed to train robust models that generalize beyond curated benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce BhasaAnuvaad, the largest speech translation dataset for Indian languages, spanning over 44 thousand hours of audio and 17 million aligned text segments across 14 Indian languages and English. Our dataset is built through a threefold methodology: (a) aggregating high-quality existing sources, (b) large-scale web crawling to ensure linguistic and domain diversity, and (c) creating synthetic data to model real-world speech disfluencies. Leveraging BhasaAnuvaad, we train IndicSeamless, a state-of-the-art speech translation model for Indian languages that performs better than existing models. Our experiments demonstrate improvements in the translation quality, setting a new standard for Indian language speech translation. We will release all the code, data and model weights in the open-source, with permissive licenses to promote accessibility and collaboration.

  Advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred research into enhancing their reasoning capabilities, particularly in math-rich STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) documents. While LLMs can generate equations or solve math-related queries, their ability to fully understand and interpret abstract mathematical symbols in long, math-rich documents remains limited. In this paper, we introduce STEM-PoM, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on math symbols within contextual scientific text. The dataset, sourced from real-world ArXiv documents, contains over 2K math symbols classified as main attributes of variables, constants, operators, and unit descriptors, with additional sub-attributes including scalar/vector/matrix for variables and local/global/discipline-specific labels for both constants and operators. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve an average accuracy of 20-60% under in-context learning and 50-60% with fine-tuning, highlighting a substantial gap in their ability to classify mathematical symbols. By improving LLMs' mathematical symbol classification, STEM-PoM further enhances models' downstream mathematical reasoning capabilities. The code and data are available atthis https URL.

  Simultaneous machine translation (SMT) takes streaming input utterances and incrementally produces target text. Existing SMT methods mainly use the partial utterance that has already arrived at the input and the generated hypothesis. Motivated by human interpreters' technique to forecast future words before hearing them, we propose $\textbf{T}$ranslation by $\textbf{A}$nticipating $\textbf{F}$uture (TAF), a method to improve translation quality while retraining low latency. Its core idea is to use a large language model (LLM) to predict future source words and opportunistically translate without introducing too much risk. We evaluate our TAF and multiple baselines of SMT on four language directions. Experiments show that TAF achieves the best translation quality-latency trade-off and outperforms the baselines by up to 5 BLEU points at the same latency (three words).

  Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose \textit{TrajAgent}, a agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In \textit{TrajAgent}, we first develop \textit{UniEnv}, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{TrajAgent} in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38\%-34.96\% over baseline methods.

  Learning from human feedback has enabled the alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences. However, collecting human preferences is expensive and time-consuming, with highly variable annotation quality. An appealing alternative is to distill preferences from LMs as a source of synthetic annotations, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative, albeit susceptible to other biases and errors. In this work, we introduce HyPER, a Hybrid Preference routER that defers an annotation to either humans or LMs, achieving better annotation quality while reducing the cost of human-only annotation. We formulate this as an optimization problem: given a preference dataset and an evaluation metric, we (1) train a performance prediction model (PPM) to predict a reward model's (RM) performance on an arbitrary combination of human and LM annotations and (2) employ a routing strategy that selects a combination that maximizes the predicted performance. We train the PPM on MultiPref, a new preference dataset with 10k instances paired with humans and LM labels. We show that the selected hybrid mixture of synthetic and direct human preferences using HyPER achieves better RM performance compared to using either one exclusively by 7-13% on RewardBench and generalizes across unseen preference datasets and other base models. We also observe the same trend in other benchmarks using Best-of-N reranking, where the hybrid mix has 2-3% better performance. Finally, we analyze features from HyPER and find that prompts with moderate safety concerns or complexity benefit the most from human feedback.

  We introduce GrammaMT, a grammatically-aware prompting approach for machine translation that uses Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT), a common form of linguistic description providing morphological and lexical annotations for source sentences. GrammaMT proposes three prompting strategies: gloss-shot, chain-gloss and model-gloss. All are training-free, requiring only a few examples that involve minimal effort to collect, and making them well-suited for low-resource setups. Experiments show that GrammaMT enhances translation performance on open-source instruction-tuned LLMs for various low- to high-resource languages across three benchmarks: (1) the largest IGT corpus, (2) the challenging 2023 SIGMORPHON Shared Task data over endangered languages, and (3) even in an out-of-domain setting with FLORES. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that leveraging gloss resources could substantially boost MT performance (by over 17 BLEU points) if LLMs accurately generate or access input sentence glosses.

  Factuality evaluation aims to detect factual errors produced by language models (LMs) and hence guide the development of more factual models. Towards this goal, we train a factuality evaluator, FenCE, that provides LM generators with claim-level factuality feedback. We conduct data augmentation on a combination of public judgment datasets to train FenCE to (1) generate textual critiques along with scores and (2) make claim-level judgment based on diverse source documents obtained by various tools. We then present a framework that leverages FenCE to improve the factuality of LM generators by constructing training data. Specifically, we generate a set of candidate responses, leverage FenCE to revise and score each response without introducing lesser-known facts, and train the generator by preferring highly scored revised responses. Experiments show that our data augmentation methods improve the evaluator's accuracy by 2.9% on LLM-AggreFact. With FenCE, we improve Llama2-7B-chat and Llama3-8B-chat's factuality rate by 16.86% and 14.45% on FActScore, outperforming state-of-the-art factuality finetuning methods by 8.83% and 6.96%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising new paradigm for text generative modeling, potentially addressing limitations of autoregressive (AR) models. However, current DLMs have been studied at a smaller scale compared to their AR counterparts and lack fair comparison on language modeling benchmarks. Additionally, training diffusion models from scratch at scale remains challenging. Given the prevalence of open-source AR language models, we propose adapting these models to build text diffusion models. We demonstrate connections between AR and diffusion modeling objectives and introduce a simple continual pre-training approach for training diffusion models. Through systematic evaluation on language modeling, reasoning, and commonsense benchmarks, we show that we can convert AR models ranging from 127M to 7B parameters (GPT2 and LLaMA) into diffusion models DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, using less than 200B tokens for training. Our experimental results reveal that these models outperform earlier DLMs and are competitive with their AR counterparts. We release a suite of DLMs (127M-355M-7B) capable of generating fluent text, performing in-context learning, filling in the middle without prompt re-ordering, and following instructionsthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance through pretraining on extensive data. This enables efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks. However, the lack of interpretability in their underlying mechanisms limits the ability to effectively steer LLMs for specific applications. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs from a cognitive perspective using eye movement measures. Specifically, we analyze the layer-wise correlation between human cognitive indicators and LLM representations. Building on these insights, we propose a heuristic approach for selecting the optimal steering layer to modulate LLM semantics. To this end, we introduce an efficient selective layer intervention based on prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, which conventionally adjust either all layers or only the final layer. Additionally, we present an implicit layer contrastive intervention during inference to steer LLMs away from toxic outputs. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation tasks, conducted on GPT-2, Llama2-7B, and Mistral-7B, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. As a model-agnostic framework, it enhances the interpretability of LLMs while improving efficiency for safe deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Math reasoning is an active area of Large Language Model (LLM) research because it is a hallmark of artificial intelligence and has implications in several domains, including math education. However, few works have explored how math reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can be isolated within models. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to improve math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster understanding of how models encode math reasoning. We introduce Math Neurosurgery (MathNeuro), a computationally efficient method we use to isolate math-specific parameters in LLMs using only forward passes. MathNeuro builds on existing work by using weights and activations to calculate parameter importance, but isolates math-specific parameters by filtering out those important for general language tasks. Through pruning parameters MathNeuro identifies, we delete a LLM's math reasoning ability without significantly impacting its general language ability. Scaling the identified parameters by a small constant improves a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by 4-17% on GSM8K and 5-35% on MATH while leaving non-math behavior unaltered. MathNeuro is also data efficient: most of its effectiveness holds when identifying math-specific parameters using a single sample. MathNeuro highlights the potential for future work to intervene on math-specific parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they still struggle with generating factually incorrect content (i.e., hallucinations). A promising approach to mitigate this issue is enabling models to express uncertainty when unsure. Previous research on uncertainty modeling has primarily focused on short-form QA, but realworld applications often require much longer responses. In this work, we introduce the task of Long-form Generation with Uncertainty(LoGU). We identify two key challenges: Uncertainty Suppression, where models hesitate to express uncertainty, and Uncertainty Misalignment, where models convey uncertainty inaccurately. To tackle these challenges, we propose a refinement-based data collection framework and a two-stage training pipeline. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, refining uncertainty based on atomic claims. The collected data are then used in training through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance uncertainty expression. Extensive experiments on three long-form instruction following datasets show that our method significantly improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and maintains the comprehensiveness of responses.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of transliterated texts in digital spaces has emphasized the need for detecting and classifying hate speech in languages beyond English, particularly in low-resource languages. As online discourse can perpetuate discrimination based on target groups, e.g. gender, religion, and origin, multi-label classification of hateful content can help in comprehending hate motivation and enhance content moderation. While previous efforts have focused on monolingual or binary hate classification tasks, no work has yet addressed the challenge of multi-label hate speech classification in transliterated Bangla. We introduce BanTH, the first multi-label transliterated Bangla hate speech dataset comprising 37.3k samples. The samples are sourced from YouTube comments, where each instance is labeled with one or more target groups, reflecting the regional demographic. We establish novel transformer encoder-based baselines by further pre-training on transliterated Bangla corpus. We also propose a novel translation-based LLM prompting strategy for transliterated text. Experiments reveal that our further pre-trained encoders are achieving state-of-the-art performance on the BanTH dataset, while our translation-based prompting outperforms other strategies in the zero-shot setting. The introduction of BanTH not only fills a critical gap in hate speech research for Bangla but also sets the stage for future exploration into code-mixed and multi-label classification challenges in underrepresented languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional transformer models often allocate a fixed amount of computational resources to every input token, leading to inefficient and unnecessary computation. To address this, the Mixture of Depths (MoD) was introduced to dynamically adjust the computational depth by skipping less important layers. Despite its promise, current MoD approaches remain under-explored and face two main challenges: (1) high training costs due to the need to train the entire model along with the routers that determine which layers to skip, and (2) the risk of performance degradation when important layers are bypassed. In response to the first issue, we propose Router-Tuning, a method that fine-tunes only the router on a small dataset, drastically reducing the computational overhead associated with full model training. For the second challenge, we propose MindSkip, which deploys Attention with Dynamic Depths. This method preserves the model's performance while significantly enhancing computational and memory efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers competitive results while dramatically improving the computation efficiency, e.g., 21\% speedup and only a 0.2\% performance drop.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Faced with an expensive human annotation process, creators of NLP systems increasingly turn to synthetic data generation. While this method shows promise, the extent to which synthetic data can replace human annotation is poorly understood. We investigate the use of synthetic data in Fact Verification (FV) and Question Answering (QA) by studying the effects of incrementally replacing human generated data with synthetic points on eight diverse datasets. Strikingly, replacing up to 90% of the training data only marginally decreases performance, but replacing the final 10% leads to severe declines. We find that models trained on purely synthetic data can be reliably improved by including as few as 125 human generated data points. We show that matching the performance gain of just a little additional human data (only 200 points) requires an order of magnitude more synthetic data and estimate price ratios at which human annotation would be a more cost-effective solution. Our results suggest that even when human annotation at scale is infeasible, there is great value to having a small proportion of the dataset being human generated.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model merging has become one of the key technologies for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, our understanding of the expected performance gains and principles when merging any two models remains limited. In this work, we introduce model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs, analogous to biological evolution. With comprehensive empirical analysis, we find that there is a certain relationship between model kinship and the performance gains after model merging, which can help guide our selection of candidate models. Inspired by this, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can yield better performance on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we discover that using model kinship as a criterion can assist us in continuously performing model merging, alleviating the degradation (local optima) in model evolution, whereas model kinship can serve as a guide to escape these traps.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive translation performance without requiring fine-tuning on additional parallel corpora. However, they still face significant challenges in certain scenarios, particularly when translating low-resource languages. A common approach to address this issue is to provide external knowledge, such as few-shot examples, to assist LLMs in translating specific source sentences. However, this method is fundamentally limited by the quality or quantity of relevant sources, which cannot always be guaranteed. To reduce LLMs' reliance on external sources, we propose BridG MT, a method that combines Sentence Bridging, which generates a sequence of sentences as a bridge that gradually transition from easy-to-translate to more difficult, and Gradual MT, which sequentially translates these sentences using earlier translations as few-shot examples for subsequent ones. Experiments conducted on four LLMs across seven languages demonstrate that our method effectively enhances translation performance, even outperforming translation methods that rely on a large number of few-shot examples.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Model Swarms, a collaborative search algorithm to adapt LLMs via swarm intelligence, the collective behavior guiding individual systems. Specifically, Model Swarms starts with a pool of LLM experts and a utility function. Guided by the best-found checkpoints across models, diverse LLM experts collaboratively move in the weight space and optimize a utility function representing model adaptation objectives. Compared to existing model composition approaches, Model Swarms offers tuning-free model adaptation, works in low-data regimes with as few as 200 examples, and does not require assumptions about specific experts in the swarm or how they should be composed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Model Swarms could flexibly adapt LLM experts to a single task, multi-task domains, reward models, as well as diverse human interests, improving over 12 model composition baselines by up to 21.0% across tasks and contexts. Further analysis reveals that LLM experts discover previously unseen capabilities in initial checkpoints and that Model Swarms enable the weak-to-strong transition of experts through the collaborative search process.

  We propose RoCoFT, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for large-scale language models (LMs) based on updating only a few rows and columns of the weight matrices in transformers. Through extensive experiments with medium-size LMs like BERT and RoBERTa, and larger LMs like Bloom-7B, Llama2-7B, and Llama2-13B, we show that our method gives comparable or better accuracies than state-of-art PEFT methods while also being more memory and computation-efficient. We also study the reason behind the effectiveness of our method with tools from neural tangent kernel theory. We empirically demonstrate that our kernel, constructed using a restricted set of row and column parameters, are numerically close to the full-parameter kernel and gives comparable classification performance. Ablation studies are conducted to investigate the impact of different algorithmic choices, including the selection strategy for rows and columns as well as the optimal rank for effective implementation of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper explores the problem of commonsense level vision-knowledge conflict in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where visual information contradicts model's internal commonsense knowledge. To study this issue, we introduce an automated framework, augmented with human-in-the-loop quality control, to generate inputs designed to simulate and evaluate these conflicts in MLLMs. Using this framework, we have crafted a diagnostic benchmark consisting of 374 original images and 1,122 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs. The benchmark covers two aspects of conflict and three question types, providing a thorough assessment tool. We apply this benchmark to assess the conflict-resolution capabilities of nine representative MLLMs from various model families. Our results indicate an evident over-reliance on parametric knowledge for approximately 20% of all queries, especially among Yes-No and action-related problems. Based on these findings, we evaluate the effectiveness of existing approaches to mitigating the conflicts and compare them to our "Focus-on-Vision" prompting strategy. Despite some improvement, the vision-knowledge conflict remains unresolved and can be further scaled through our data construction framework. Our proposed framework, benchmark, and analysis contribute to the understanding and mitigation of vision-knowledge conflicts in MLLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), while effectively integrating external knowledge to address the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be hindered by imperfect retrieval that contain irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Previous studies have rarely connected the behavior of RAG through joint analysis, particularly regarding error propagation coming from imperfect retrieval and potential conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. Through comprehensive and controlled analyses under realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is inevitable, common, and harmful. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome imperfect retrieval in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To address this, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation. It adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments with Gemini and Claude demonstrate the superior performance of Astute RAG compared to previous robustness-enhanced RAG approaches. Specifically, Astute RAG is the only RAG method that achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing conventional use of LLMs under the worst-case scenario. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of Astute RAG in resolving knowledge conflicts, thereby improving the trustworthiness of RAG.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual NMT is a viable solution for translating low-resource languages (LRLs) when data from high-resource languages (HRLs) from the same language family is available. However, the training schedule, i.e. the order of presentation of languages, has an impact on the quality of such systems. Here, in a many-to-one translation setting, we propose to apply two algorithms that use reinforcement learning to optimize the training schedule of NMT: (1) Teacher-Student Curriculum Learning and (2) Deep Q Network. The former uses an exponentially smoothed estimate of the returns of each action based on the loss on monolingual or multilingual development subsets, while the latter estimates rewards using an additional neural network trained from the history of actions selected in different states of the system, together with the rewards received. On a 8-to-1 translation dataset with LRLs and HRLs, our second method improves BLEU and COMET scores with respect to both random selection of monolingual batches and shuffled multilingual batches, by adjusting the number of presentations of LRL vs. HRL batches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  English-centric large language models (LLMs) often show strong multilingual capabilities. However, their multilingual performance remains unclear and is under-evaluated for many other languages. Most benchmarks for multilinguality focus on classic NLP tasks or cover a minimal number of languages. We introduce MEXA, a method for assessing the multilingual capabilities of pre-trained English-centric LLMs using parallel sentences, which are available for more languages than existing downstream tasks. MEXA leverages that English-centric LLMs use English as a pivot language in their intermediate layers. MEXA computes the alignment between English and non-English languages using parallel sentences to evaluate the transfer of language understanding from English to other languages. This alignment can be used to estimate model performance in different languages. We conduct controlled experiments using various parallel datasets (FLORES-200 and Bible), models (Llama family, Gemma family, Mistral, and OLMo), and established downstream tasks (Belebele, m-MMLU, and m-ARC). We explore different methods to compute embeddings in decoder-only models. Our results show that MEXA, in its default settings, achieves an average Pearson correlation of 0.90 between its predicted scores and actual task performance across languages. This suggests that MEXA is a reliable method for estimating the multilingual capabilities of English-centric LLMs, providing a clearer understanding of their multilingual potential and the inner workings of LLMs. Leaderboard:this https URL, Code:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While personalized recommendations are often desired by users, it can be difficult in practice to distinguish cases of bias from cases of personalization: we find that models generate racially stereotypical recommendations regardless of whether the user revealed their identity intentionally through explicit indications or unintentionally through implicit cues. We demonstrate that when people use large language models (LLMs) to generate recommendations, the LLMs produce responses that reflect both what the user wants and who the user is. We argue that chatbots ought to transparently indicate when recommendations are influenced by a user's revealed identity characteristics, but observe that they currently fail to do so. Our experiments show that even though a user's revealed identity significantly influences model recommendations (p < 0.001), model responses obfuscate this fact in response to user queries. This bias and lack of transparency occurs consistently across multiple popular consumer LLMs and for four American racial groups.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent calls for pluralistic alignment emphasize that AI systems should address the diverse needs of all people. Yet, efforts in this space often require sorting people into fixed buckets of pre-specified diversity-defining dimensions (e.g., demographics), risking smoothing out individualistic variations or even stereotyping. To achieve an authentic representation of diversity that respects individuality, we propose individualistic alignment. While individualistic alignment can take various forms, we introduce IndieValueCatalog, a dataset transformed from the influential World Values Survey (WVS), to study language models (LMs) on the specific challenge of individualistic value reasoning. Given a sample of an individual's value-expressing statements, models are tasked with predicting this person's value judgments in novel cases. With IndieValueCatalog, we reveal critical limitations in frontier LMs, which achieve only 55 % to 65% accuracy in predicting individualistic values. Moreover, our results highlight that a precise description of individualistic values cannot be approximated only with demographic information. We also identify a partiality of LMs in reasoning about global individualistic values, as measured by our proposed Value Inequity Index ({\sigma}Inequity). Finally, we train a series of IndieValueReasoners to reveal new patterns and dynamics into global human values.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models (LMs) rely on their parametric knowledge augmented with relevant contextual knowledge for certain tasks, such as question answering. However, the contextual knowledge can contain private information that may be leaked when answering queries, and estimating this privacy leakage is not well understood. A straightforward approach of directly comparing an LM's output to the contexts can overestimate the privacy risk, since the LM's parametric knowledge might already contain the augmented contextual knowledge. To this end, we introduce $\emph{context influence}$, a metric that builds on differential privacy, a widely-adopted privacy notion, to estimate the privacy leakage of contextual knowledge during decoding. Our approach effectively measures how each subset of the context influences an LM's response while separating the specific parametric knowledge of the LM. Using our context influence metric, we demonstrate that context privacy leakage occurs when contextual knowledge is out of distribution with respect to parametric knowledge. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate how context influence properly attributes the privacy leakage to augmented contexts, and we evaluate how factors-- such as model size, context size, generation position, etc.-- affect context privacy leakage. The practical implications of our results will inform practitioners of the privacy risk associated with augmented contextual knowledge.

  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an established and dynamic field. Despite this, what constitutes NLP research remains debated. In this work, we address the question by quantitatively examining NLP research papers. We propose a taxonomy of research contributions and introduce NLPContributions, a dataset of nearly $2k$ NLP research paper abstracts, carefully annotated to identify scientific contributions and classify their types according to this taxonomy. We also introduce a novel task of automatically identifying contribution statements and classifying their types from research papers. We present experimental results for this task and apply our model to $\sim$$29k$ NLP research papers to analyze their contributions, aiding in the understanding of the nature of NLP research. We show that NLP research has taken a winding path -- with the focus on language and human-centric studies being prominent in the 1970s and 80s, tapering off in the 1990s and 2000s, and starting to rise again since the late 2010s. Alongside this revival, we observe a steady rise in dataset and methodological contributions since the 1990s, such that today, on average, individual NLP papers contribute in more ways than ever before. Our dataset and analyses offer a powerful lens for tracing research trends and offer potential for generating informed, data-driven literature surveys.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of fine-tuning a language model (LM) for a target task by optimally using the information from $n$ auxiliary tasks. This problem has broad applications in NLP, such as targeted instruction tuning and data selection in chain-of-thought fine-tuning. The key challenge of this problem is that not all auxiliary tasks are beneficial in improving the performance of the target task. Thus, selecting the right subset of auxiliary tasks is crucial. Conventional subset selection methods, such as forward and backward stepwise selection, are unsuitable for LM fine-tuning because they require repeated training on subsets of auxiliary tasks. This paper introduces a new algorithm for estimating model fine-tuning performance without requiring repeated training. Our algorithm first performs multitask training using data from all tasks to obtain a meta initialization. Then, we approximate the model fine-tuning loss of a subset using functional values and gradients from the meta initialization. Empirically, we find that this gradient-based approximation holds with remarkable accuracy for twelve transformer-based LMs. Thus, we can now estimate fine-tuning performances on CPUs within a few seconds. Finally, we fine-tune the pretrained base model once on the selected subset of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to validate this approach, delivering a speedup of $30\times$ over conventional subset selection while incurring only $1\%$ error of the true fine-tuning performances. In downstream evaluations involving both instruction tuning and chain-of-thought fine-tuning, this loss-based selection approach improves over prior gradient or representation similarity-based methods for subset selection by up to $3.8\%$.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) aim to decompose the activation space of large language models (LLMs) into human-interpretable latent directions or features. As we increase the number of features in the SAE, hierarchical features tend to split into finer features ("math" may split into "algebra", "geometry", etc.), a phenomenon referred to as feature splitting. However, we show that sparse decomposition and splitting of hierarchical features is not robust. Specifically, we show that seemingly monosemantic features fail to fire where they should, and instead get "absorbed" into their children features. We coin this phenomenon feature absorption, and show that it is caused by optimizing for sparsity in SAEs whenever the underlying features form a hierarchy. We introduce a metric to detect absorption in SAEs, and validate our findings empirically on hundreds of LLM SAEs. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE sizes or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue. We discuss the implications of feature absorption in SAEs and some potential approaches to solve the fundamental theoretical issues before SAEs can be used for interpreting LLMs robustly and at scale.

  We introduce Diffusion-based Audio Captioning (DAC), a non-autoregressive diffusion model tailored for diverse and efficient audio captioning. Although existing captioning models relying on language backbones have achieved remarkable success in various captioning tasks, their insufficient performance in terms of generation speed and diversity impede progress in audio understanding and multimedia applications. Our diffusion-based framework offers unique advantages stemming from its inherent stochasticity and holistic context modeling in captioning. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that DAC not only achieves SOTA performance levels compared to existing benchmarks in the caption quality, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of generation speed and diversity. The success of DAC illustrates that text generation can also be seamlessly integrated with audio and visual generation tasks using a diffusion backbone, paving the way for a unified, audio-related generative model across different modalities.

  Critical text assessment is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking, peer review, and essay grading. Yet, existing work treats critical text assessment as a black box problem, limiting interpretability and human-AI collaboration. To close this gap, we introduce Structured Reasoning In Critical Text Assessment (STRICTA), a novel specification framework to model text assessment as an explicit, step-wise reasoning process. STRICTA breaks down the assessment into a graph of interconnected reasoning steps drawing on causality theory (Pearl, 1995). This graph is populated based on expert interaction data and used to study the assessment process and facilitate human-AI collaboration. We formally define STRICTA and apply it in a study on biomedical paper assessment, resulting in a dataset of over 4000 reasoning steps from roughly 40 biomedical experts on more than 20 papers. We use this dataset to empirically study expert reasoning in critical text assessment, and investigate if LLMs are able to imitate and support experts within these workflows. The resulting tools and datasets pave the way for studying collaborative expert-AI reasoning in text assessment, in peer review and beyond.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work introduces a novel framework for evaluating LLMs' capacity to balance instruction-following with critical reasoning when presented with multiple-choice questions containing no valid answers. Through systematic evaluation across arithmetic, domain-specific knowledge, and high-stakes medical decision tasks, we demonstrate that post-training aligned models often default to selecting invalid options, while base models exhibit improved refusal capabilities that scale with model size. Our analysis reveals that alignment techniques, though intended to enhance helpfulness, can inadvertently impair models' reflective judgment--the ability to override default behaviors when faced with invalid options. We additionally conduct a parallel human study showing similar instruction-following biases, with implications for how these biases may propagate through human feedback datasets used in alignment. We provide extensive ablation studies examining the impact of model size, training techniques, and prompt engineering. Our findings highlight fundamental tensions between alignment optimization and preservation of critical reasoning capabilities, with important implications for developing more robust AI systems for real-world deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models have become widely used in biomedical entity linking (BioEL) due to their excellent performance and efficient memory usage. However, these models are usually trained only with positive samples, i.e., entities that match the input mention's identifier, and do not explicitly learn from hard negative samples, which are entities that look similar but have different meanings. To address this limitation, we introduce ANGEL (Learning from Negative Samples in Biomedical Generative Entity Linking), the first framework that trains generative BioEL models using negative samples. Specifically, a generative model is initially trained to generate positive entity names from the knowledge base for given input entities. Subsequently, both correct and incorrect outputs are gathered from the model's top-k predictions. Finally, the model is updated to prioritize the correct predictions through preference optimization. Our models outperform the previous best baseline models by up to an average top-1 accuracy of 1.4% on five benchmarks. When incorporating our framework into pre-training, the performance improvement increases further to 1.7%, demonstrating its effectiveness in both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages.

  We perform a critical examination of the scientific methodology behind contemporary large language model (LLM) research. For this we assess over 2,000 research works released between 2020 and 2024 based on criteria typical of what is considered good research (e.g. presence of statistical tests and reproducibility), and cross-validate it with arguments that are at the centre of controversy (e.g., claims of emergent behaviour). We find multiple trends, such as declines in ethics disclaimers, a rise of LLMs as evaluators, and an increase on claims of LLM reasoning abilities without leveraging human evaluation. We note that conference checklists are effective at curtailing some of these issues, but balancing velocity and rigour in research cannot solely rely on these. We tie all these findings to findings from recent meta-reviews and extend recommendations on how to address what does, does not, and should work in LLM research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial method for addressing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). While recent research has extended RAG models to complex noisy scenarios, these explorations often confine themselves to limited noise types and presuppose that noise is inherently detrimental to LLMs, potentially deviating from real-world retrieval environments and restricting practical applicability. In this paper, we define seven distinct noise types from a linguistic perspective and establish a Noise RAG Benchmark (NoiserBench), a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing multiple datasets and reasoning tasks. Through empirical evaluation of eight representative LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, we reveal that these noises can be further categorized into two practical groups: noise that is beneficial to LLMs (aka beneficial noise) and noise that is harmful to LLMs (aka harmful noise). While harmful noise generally impairs performance, beneficial noise may enhance several aspects of model capabilities and overall performance. Our analysis offers insights for developing more robust, adaptable RAG solutions and mitigating hallucinations across diverse retrieval scenarios. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is an increasing trend towards evaluating NLP models with LLMs instead of human judgments, raising questions about the validity of these evaluations, as well as their reproducibility in the case of proprietary models. We provide JUDGE-BENCH, an extensible collection of 20 NLP datasets with human annotations covering a broad range of evaluated properties and types of data, and comprehensively evaluate 11 current LLMs, covering both open-weight and proprietary models, for their ability to replicate the annotations. Our evaluations show substantial variance across models and datasets. Models are reliable evaluators on some tasks, but overall display substantial variability depending on the property being evaluated, the expertise level of the human judges, and whether the language is human or model-generated. We conclude that LLMs should be carefully validated against human judgments before being used as evaluators.

  This paper introduces BMIKE-53, a comprehensive benchmark for cross-lingual in-context knowledge editing (IKE) across 53 languages, unifying three knowledge editing (KE) datasets: zsRE, CounterFact, and WikiFactDiff. Cross-lingual KE, which requires knowledge edited in one language to generalize across others while preserving unrelated knowledge, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate IKE under zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot setups, incorporating tailored metric-specific demonstrations. Our findings reveal that model scale and demonstration alignment critically govern cross-lingual IKE efficacy, with larger models and tailored demonstrations significantly improving performance. Linguistic properties, particularly script type, strongly influence performance variation across languages, with non-Latin languages underperforming due to issues like language confusion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Finetuning language models (LMs) is crucial for adapting the models to downstream data and tasks. However, full finetuning is usually costly. Existing work, such as parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT), often focuses on \textit{how to finetune} but neglects the issue of \textit{where to finetune}. As a pioneering work on reducing the cost of backpropagation (at the layer level) by answering where to finetune, we conduct a semantic analysis of the LM inference process. We first propose using transition traces of the latent representation to compute deviations (or loss). Then, using a derived formula of scaling law, we estimate the gain of each layer in reducing deviation (or loss). Further, we narrow down the scope for finetuning, and also, study the cost-benefit balance of LM finetuning. We perform extensive experiments across well-known LMs and datasets. The results show that our approach is effective and efficient, and outperforms the existing baselines. Our approach is orthogonal to other techniques for improving finetuning efficiency, such as PEFT methods, offering practical values on LM finetuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on effort- and resource-intensive fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call {\em affect}). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source domain data for target domain contents. (3) These examples are adopted as few-shot demonstrations for the inference module to process the target domain content. The RAEmoLLM can effectively enhance the general performance of LLMs in cross-domain misinformation detection tasks through affect-based retrieval, without fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the other few-shot methods on three datasets, with the highest increases of 15.64%, 31.18%, and 15.73% respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) usually only provide users with the inference APIs, namely the emerging Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) setting. To adapt MaaS PLMs to downstream tasks without accessing their parameters and gradients, some existing methods focus on the output-side adaptation of PLMs, viewing the PLM as an encoder and then optimizing a task-specific decoder for decoding the output hidden states and class scores of the PLM. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, they only use a single prompt to query PLMs for decoding, leading to a heavy reliance on the quality of the adopted prompt. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-Prompting Decoder (MPD) framework for MaaS adaptation. The core idea is to query PLMs with multiple different prompts for each sample, thereby obtaining multiple output hidden states and class scores for subsequent decoding. Such multi-prompting decoding paradigm can simultaneously mitigate reliance on the quality of a single prompt, alleviate the issue of data scarcity under the few-shot setting, and provide richer knowledge extracted from PLMs. Specifically, we propose two decoding strategies: multi-prompting decoding with optimal transport for hidden states and calibrated decoding for class scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language understanding datasets under the few-shot setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrate significant potential in the medical domain and are often evaluated using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) modeled on exams like the USMLE. However, such benchmarks may overestimate true clinical understanding by rewarding pattern recognition and test-taking heuristics. To investigate this, we created a fictional medical benchmark centered on an imaginary organ, the Glianorex, allowing us to separate memorized knowledge from reasoning ability. We generated textbooks and MCQs in English and French using leading LLMs, then evaluated proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific models in a zero-shot setting. Despite the fictional content, models achieved an average score of 64%, while physicians scored only 27%. Fine-tuned medical models outperformed base models in English but not in French. Ablation and interpretability analyses revealed that models frequently relied on shallow cues, test-taking strategies, and hallucinated reasoning to identify the correct choice. These results suggest that standard MCQ-based evaluations may not effectively measure clinical reasoning and highlight the need for more robust, clinically meaningful assessment methods for LLMs.

  Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrates varying performance under different reasoning tasks. Previous work attempts to evaluate it but falls short in providing an in-depth analysis of patterns that influence the CoT. In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances both the faithfulness and effectiveness of CoT.

  Lexicon or dictionary generation across domains has the potential for societal impact, as it can potentially enhance information accessibility for a diverse user base while preserving language identity. Prior work in the field primarily focuses on bilingual lexical induction, which deals with word alignments using mapping or corpora-based approaches. However, these approaches do not cater to domain-specific lexicon generation that consists of domain-specific terminology. This task becomes particularly important in specialized medical, engineering, and other technical domains, owing to the highly infrequent usage of the terms and scarcity of data involving domain-specific terms especially for low/mid-resource languages. In this paper, we propose a new model to generate dictionary words for $6$ Indian languages in the multi-domain setting. Our model consists of domain-specific and domain-generic layers that encode information, and these layers are invoked via a learnable routing technique. We also release a new benchmark dataset consisting of >75K translation pairs across 6 Indian languages spanning 8 diversethis http URLconduct both zero-shot and few-shot experiments across multiple domains to show the efficacy of our proposed model in generalizing to unseen domains and unseen languages. Additionally, we also perform a post-hoc human evaluation on unseen languages. The source code and dataset is present atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT-4 and LLaMA families, have demonstrated considerable success across diverse tasks, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, these models exhibit a positional bias, particularly an even worse anchored bias in the GPT-2 family, where they consistently favour the first choice 'A' in MCQs during inference. This anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention heads, using the "logit lens" method to trace and modify the specific value vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first choice 'A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not only mitigate the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for the GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias from the failing cases in MCQs within the GPT-2 models, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that significantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs.

  As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, aligning these models with human values remains a significant challenge. Recent studies show that reasoning abilities contribute significantly to model safety, while integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures can further enhance alignment. In this work, we address a fundamental question: How to effectively incorporate reasoning abilities and MoE architectures into self-alignment process in LLMs? We propose Mixture of insighTful Experts (MoTE), a novel framework that synergistically combines reasoning chains and expert mixtures to improve self-alignments. From a data perspective, MoTE employs a structured reasoning chain comprising four key stages: Question Analysis, Answer Guidance, Safe Answer, and Safety Checking. This approach enhances safety through multi-step reasoning and proves effective even for smaller and less powerful LLMs (e.g., 7B models). From an architectural perspective, MoTE adopts a multi-LoRA framework with step-level routing, where each expert is dedicated to a specific reasoning step. This design eliminates the need for balance losses, ensures stable training, and supports adaptive inference lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that MoTE significantly improves model safety, jailbreak resistance, and over-refusal capabilities, achieving performance comparable to OpenAI's state-of-the-art o1 model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Analogical reasoning is a unique ability of humans to address unfamiliar challenges by transferring strategies from relevant past experiences. One key finding in psychology is that compared with irrelevant past experiences, recalling relevant ones can help humans better handle new tasks. Coincidentally, the NLP community has also recently found that self-generating relevant examples in the context can help large language models (LLMs) better solve a given problem than hand-crafted prompts. However, it is yet not clear whether relevance is the key factor eliciting such capability, i.e., can LLMs benefit more from self-generated relevant examples than irrelevant ones? In this work, we systematically explore whether LLMs can truly perform analogical reasoning on a diverse set of reasoning tasks. With extensive experiments and analysis, we show that self-generated random examples can surprisingly achieve comparable or even better performance on certain tasks, e.g., 4% performance boost on GSM8K with random biological examples. We find that the accuracy of self-generated examples is the key factor and subsequently design two novel methods with improved performance and significantly reduced inference costs. Overall, we aim to advance a deeper understanding of LLM analogical reasoning and hope this work stimulates further research in the design of self-generated contexts.

  _Sohee Yang, Elena Gribovskaya, Nora Kassner, Mor Geva, Sebastian Riedel_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) latently perform multi-hop reasoning with complex prompts such as "The mother of the singer of 'Superstition' is". We look for evidence of a latent reasoning pathway where an LLM (1) latently identifies "the singer of 'Superstition'" as Stevie Wonder, the bridge entity, and (2) uses its knowledge of Stevie Wonder's mother to complete the prompt. We analyze these two hops individually and consider their co-occurrence as indicative of latent multi-hop reasoning. For the first hop, we test if changing the prompt to indirectly mention the bridge entity instead of any other entity increases the LLM's internal recall of the bridge entity. For the second hop, we test if increasing this recall causes the LLM to better utilize what it knows about the bridge entity. We find strong evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning for the prompts of certain relation types, with the reasoning pathway used in more than 80% of the prompts. However, the utilization is highly contextual, varying across different types of prompts. Also, on average, the evidence for the second hop and the full multi-hop traversal is rather moderate and only substantial for the first hop. Moreover, we find a clear scaling trend with increasing model size for the first hop of reasoning but not for the second hop. Our experimental findings suggest potential challenges and opportunities for future development and applications of LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive few-shot generalization on many tasks via in-context learning (ICL). Despite their success in showing such emergent abilities, the scale and complexity of larger models also lead to unprecedentedly high computational demands and deployment challenges. In reaction, researchers explore transferring the powerful capabilities of larger models to more efficient and compact models by typically aligning the output of smaller (student) models with that of larger (teacher) models. Existing methods either train student models on the generated outputs of teacher models or imitate their token-level probability distributions. However, these distillation methods pay little to no attention to the input, which also plays a crucial role in ICL. Based on the finding that the performance of ICL is highly sensitive to the selection of demonstration examples, we propose Bidirectional Alignment (BiAlign) to fully leverage the models' preferences for ICL examples to improve the ICL abilities of student models. Specifically, we introduce the alignment of input preferences between student and teacher models by incorporating a novel ranking loss, in addition to aligning the token-level output distribution. With extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that BiAlign can consistently outperform existing baselines on a variety of tasks involving language understanding, reasoning, and coding.

  Prior methods for controlling image generation are limited in their ability to be taught new tasks. In contrast, vision-language models, or VLMs, can learn tasks in-context and produce the correct outputs for a given input. We propose a dual-process distillation scheme that allows feed-forward image generators to learn new tasks from deliberative VLMs. Our scheme uses a VLM to rate the generated images and backpropagates this gradient to update the weights of the image generator. Our general framework enables a wide variety of new control tasks through the same text-and-image based interface. We showcase a handful of applications of this technique for different types of control signals, such as commonsense inferences and visual prompts. With our method, users can implement multimodal controls for properties such as color palette, line weight, horizon position, and relative depth within a matter of minutes.

  Recent diffusion models have advanced image editing by enhancing visual quality and control, supporting broad applications across creative and personalized domains. However, current image editing largely overlooks multi-object scenarios, where precise control over object categories, counts, and spatial layouts remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a new task, quantity-and-layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit), which aims to enable fine-grained control of object quantity and spatial structure in complex scenes. We further propose IMAGHarmony, a structure-aware framework that incorporates harmony-aware attention (HA) to integrate multimodal semantics, explicitly modeling object counts and layouts to enhance editing accuracy and structural consistency. In addition, we observe that diffusion models are susceptible to initial noise and exhibit strong preferences for specific noise patterns. Motivated by this, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that chooses semantically aligned initial noise samples based on vision-language matching, thereby improving generation stability and layout consistency in multi-object editing. To support evaluation, we construct HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural alignment and semantic accuracy. The code and model are available atthis https URL.

  Numerous low-level vision tasks operate in the RAW domain due to its linear properties, bit depth, and sensor designs. Despite this, RAW image datasets are scarce and more expensive to collect than the already large and public sRGB datasets. For this reason, many approaches try to generate realistic RAW images using sensor information and sRGB images. This paper covers the second challenge on RAW Reconstruction from sRGB (Reverse ISP). We aim to recover RAW sensor images from smartphones given the corresponding sRGB images without metadata and, by doing this, ``reverse" the ISP transformation. Over 150 participants joined this NTIRE 2025 challenge and submitted efficient models. The proposed methods and benchmark establish the state-of-the-art for generating realistic RAW data.

  Recent advances in scene understanding have leveraged multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for 3D reasoning by capitalizing on their strong 2D pretraining. However, the lack of explicit 3D data during MLLM pretraining limits 3D representation capability. In this paper, we investigate the 3D-awareness of MLLMs by evaluating multi-view correspondence and reveal a strong positive correlation between the quality of 3D-aware representation and downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose 3DRS, a framework that enhances MLLM 3D representation learning by introducing supervision from pretrained 3D foundation models. Our approach aligns MLLM visual features with rich 3D knowledge distilled from 3D models, effectively improving scene understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and MLLMs -- including visual grounding, captioning, and question answering -- demonstrate consistent performance gains. Project page:this https URL

  Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training large neural networks on large-scale datasets requires substantial computational resources, particularly for dense prediction tasks such as object detection. Although dataset distillation (DD) has been proposed to alleviate these demands by synthesizing compact datasets from larger ones, most existing work focuses solely on image classification, leaving the more complex detection setting largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce OD3, a novel optimization-free data distillation framework specifically designed for object detection. Our approach involves two stages: first, a candidate selection process in which object instances are iteratively placed in synthesized images based on their suitable locations, and second, a candidate screening process using a pre-trained observer model to remove low-confidence objects. We perform our data synthesis framework on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC, two popular detection datasets, with compression ratios ranging from 0.25% to 5%. Compared to the prior solely existing dataset distillation method on detection and conventional core set selection methods, OD3 delivers superior accuracy, establishes new state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior best method by more than 14% on COCO mAP50 at a compression ratio of 1.0%.

- **[Fast and Robust Rotation Averaging with Anisotropic Coordinate Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01940)**  `arXiv:2506.01940`  
  _Yaroslava Lochman, Carl Olsson, Christopher Zach_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anisotropic rotation averaging has recently been explored as a natural extension of respective isotropic methods. In the anisotropic formulation, uncertainties of the estimated relative rotations -- obtained via standard two-view optimization -- are propagated to the optimization of absolute rotations. The resulting semidefinite relaxations are able to recover global minima but scale poorly with the problem size. Local methods are fast and also admit robust estimation but are sensitive to initialization. They usually employ minimum spanning trees and therefore suffer from drift accumulation and can get trapped in poor local minima. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between optimality, robustness and efficiency of anisotropic rotation averaging. We analyze a family of block coordinate descent methods initially proposed to optimize the standard chordal distances, and derive a much simpler formulation and an anisotropic extension obtaining a fast general solver. We integrate this solver into the extended anisotropic large-scale robust rotation averaging pipeline. The resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on public structure-from-motion datasets. Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel method for low-rank personalization of a generic model for head avatar generation. Prior work proposes generic models that achieve high-quality face animation by leveraging large-scale datasets of multiple identities. However, such generic models usually fail to synthesize unique identity-specific details, since they learn a general domain prior. To adapt to specific subjects, we find that it is still challenging to capture high-frequency facial details via popular solutions like low-rank adaptation (LoRA). This motivates us to propose a specific architecture, a Register Module, that enhances the performance of LoRA, while requiring only a small number of parameters to adapt to an unseen identity. Our module is applied to intermediate features of a pre-trained model, storing and re-purposing information in a learnable 3D feature space. To demonstrate the efficacy of our personalization method, we collect a dataset of talking videos of individuals with distinctive facial details, such as wrinkles and tattoos. Our approach faithfully captures unseen faces, outperforming existing methods quantitatively and qualitatively. We will release the code, models, and dataset to the public.

  Spatial intelligence, encompassing 3D reconstruction, perception, and reasoning, is fundamental to applications such as robotics, aerial imaging, and extended reality. A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core 3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

  Text-guided image editing has seen rapid progress in natural image domains, but its adaptation to medical imaging remains limited and lacks standardized evaluation. Clinically, such editing holds promise for simulating surgical outcomes, creating personalized teaching materials, and enhancing patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedEBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a failure analysis protocol based on attention grounding, using IoU between attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization. MedEBench provides a solid foundation for developing and evaluating reliable, clinically meaningful medical image editing systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative diffusion models learn probability densities over diverse image datasets by estimating the score with a neural network trained to remove noise. Despite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the internal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood. Here, we examine a UNet trained for denoising on the ImageNet dataset, to better understand its internal representation and computation of the score. We show that the middle block of the UNet decomposes individual images into sparse subsets of active channels, and that the vector of spatial averages of these channels can provide a nonlinear representation of the underlying clean images. We develop a novel algorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images from this representation and demonstrate that it recovers a sample from a set of images defined by a target image representation. We then study the properties of the representation and demonstrate that Euclidean distances in the latent space correspond to distances between conditional densities induced by representations as well as semantic similarities in the image space. Applying a clustering algorithm in the representation space yields groups of images that share both fine details (e.g., specialized features, textured regions, small objects), as well as global structure, but are only partially aligned with object identities. Thus, we show for the first time that a network trained solely on denoising contains a rich and accessible sparse representation of images.

  Understanding real-world videos with complex semantics and long temporal dependencies remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in vision-language tasks, while reinforcement learning tuning (RLT) has further improved their reasoning abilities. In this work, we explore RLT as a post-training strategy to enhance the video-specific reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Built upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, we propose a dual-reward formulation that supervises both semantic and temporal reasoning through discrete and continuous reward signals. To facilitate effective preference-based optimization, we introduce a variance-aware data selection strategy based on repeated inference to identify samples that provide informative learning signals. We evaluate our approach across eight representative video understanding tasks, including VideoQA, Temporal Video Grounding, and Grounded VideoQA. Our method consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing RLT baselines, achieving superior performance with significantly less training data. These results underscore the importance of reward design and data selection in advancing reasoning-centric video understanding with MLLMs. Notably, The initial code release (two months ago) has now been expanded with updates, including optimized reward mechanisms and additional datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models pre-trained on large scale of unlabeled biomedical images and associated reports learn generalizable semantic representations. These multi-modal representations can benefit various downstream tasks in the biomedical domain. Contrastive learning is widely used to pre-train vision-language models for general natural images and associated captions. Despite its popularity, we found biomedical texts have complex and domain-specific semantics that are often neglected by common contrastive methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, perturbed report discrimination, for pre-train biomedical vision-language models. First, we curate a set of text perturbation methods that keep the same words, but disrupt the semantic structure of the sentence. Next, we apply different types of perturbation to reports, and use the model to distinguish the original report from the perturbed ones given the associated image. Parallel to this, we enhance the sensitivity of our method to higher level of granularity for both modalities by contrasting attention-weighted image sub-regions and sub-words in the image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple downstream tasks, and our method outperforms strong baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach learns more semantic meaningful and robust multi-modal representations.

  Recently, the powerful text-to-image capabilities of ChatGPT-4o have led to growing appreciation for native multimodal large language models. However, its multimodal capabilities remain confined to images and text. Yet beyond images, the ability to understand and generate 3D content is equally crucial. To address this gap, we propose ShapeLLM-Omni-a native 3D large language model capable of understanding and generating 3D assets and text in any sequence. First, we train a 3D vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE), which maps 3D objects into a discrete latent space to achieve efficient and accurate shape representation and reconstruction. Building upon the 3D-aware discrete tokens, we innovatively construct a large-scale continuous training dataset named 3D-Alpaca, encompassing generation, comprehension, and editing, thus providing rich resources for future research and training. Finally, by performing instruction-based training of the Qwen-2.5-vl-7B-Instruct model on the 3D-Alpaca dataset.

  The increasing demand for hygienic and portable biometric systems has underscored the critical need for advancements in contactless fingerprint recognition. Despite its potential, this technology faces notable challenges, including out-of-focus image acquisition, reduced contrast between fingerprint ridges and valleys, variations in finger positioning, and perspective distortion. These factors significantly hinder the accuracy and reliability of contactless fingerprint matching. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-stage transformer-based contactless fingerprint matching approach that first captures global spatial features and subsequently refines localized feature alignment across fingerprint samples. By employing a hierarchical feature extraction and matching pipeline, our method ensures fine-grained, cross-sample alignment while maintaining the robustness of global feature representation. We perform extensive evaluations on publicly available datasets such as HKPolyU and RidgeBase under different evaluation protocols, such as contactless-to-contact matching and contactless-to-contactless matching and demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods, including COTS solutions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning an animatable and clothed human avatar model with vivid dynamics and photorealistic appearance from multi-view videos is an important foundational research problem in computer graphics and vision. Fueled by recent advances in implicit representations, the quality of the animatable avatars has achieved an unprecedented level by attaching the implicit representation to drivable human template meshes. However, they usually fail to preserve the highest level of detail, particularly apparent when the virtual camera is zoomed in and when rendering at 4K resolution and higher. We argue that this limitation stems from inaccurate surface tracking, specifically, depth misalignment and surface drift between character geometry and the ground truth surface, which forces the detailed appearance model to compensate for geometric errors. To address this, we propose a latent deformation model and supervising the 3D deformation of the animatable character using guidance from foundational 2D video point trackers, which offer improved robustness to shading and surface variations, and are less prone to local minima than differentiable rendering. To mitigate the drift over time and lack of 3D awareness of 2D point trackers, we introduce a cascaded training strategy that generates consistent 3D point tracks by anchoring point tracks to the rendered avatar, which ultimately supervises our avatar at the vertex and texel level. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a novel dataset comprising five multi-view video sequences, each over 10 minutes in duration, captured using 40 calibrated 6K-resolution cameras, featuring subjects dressed in clothing with challenging texture patterns and wrinkle deformations. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved performance in rendering quality and geometric accuracy over the prior state of the art.

  The emergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) has brought significant advancements to video generation, especially in text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. Although video generation is widely applied in various fields, most existing models are limited to single scenarios and cannot perform diverse video generation and editing through dynamic content manipulation. We propose OmniV2V, a video model capable of generating and editing videos across different scenarios based on various operations, including: object movement, object addition, mask-guided video edit, try-on, inpainting, outpainting, human animation, and controllable character video synthesis. We explore a unified dynamic content manipulation injection module, which effectively integrates the requirements of the above tasks. In addition, we design a visual-text instruction module based on LLaVA, enabling the model to effectively understand the correspondence between visual content and instructions. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive multi-task data processing system. Since there is data overlap among various tasks, this system can efficiently provide data augmentation. Using this system, we construct a multi-type, multi-scenario OmniV2V dataset and its corresponding OmniV2V-Test benchmark. Extensive experiments show that OmniV2V works as well as, and sometimes better than, the best existing open-source and commercial models for many video generation and editing tasks.

  Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects. Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views, while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a new task, Referring and Reasoning for Selective Masks (R2SM), which extends text-guided segmentation by incorporating mask-type selection driven by user intent. This task challenges vision-language models to determine whether to generate a modal (visible) or amodal (complete) segmentation mask based solely on natural language prompts. To support the R2SM task, we present the R2SM dataset, constructed by augmenting annotations of COCOA-cls, D2SA, and MUVA. The R2SM dataset consists of both modal and amodal text queries, each paired with the corresponding ground-truth mask, enabling model finetuning and evaluation for the ability to segment images as per user intent. Specifically, the task requires the model to interpret whether a given prompt refers to only the visible part of an object or to its complete shape, including occluded regions, and then produce the appropriate segmentation. For example, if a prompt explicitly requests the whole shape of a partially hidden object, the model is expected to output an amodal mask that completes the occluded parts. In contrast, prompts without explicit mention of hidden regions should generate standard modal masks. The R2SM benchmark provides a challenging and insightful testbed for advancing research in multimodal reasoning and intent-aware segmentation.

  Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) typically depends on a single visual modality when defending against presentation attacks such as print attacks, screen replays, and 3D masks, resulting in limited generalization across devices, environments, and attack types. Meanwhile, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved breakthroughs in image-text understanding and semantic reasoning, suggesting that integrating visual and linguistic co-inference into FAS can substantially improve both robustness and interpretability. However, the lack of a high-quality vision-language multimodal dataset has been a critical bottleneck. To address this, we introduce FaceCoT (Face Chain-of-Thought), the first large-scale Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset tailored for FAS. FaceCoT covers 14 spoofing attack types and enriches model learning with high-quality CoT VQA annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a caption model refined via reinforcement learning to expand the dataset and enhance annotation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a CoT-Enhanced Progressive Learning (CEPL) strategy to better leverage the CoT data and boost model performance on FAS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with FaceCoT and CEPL outperform state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.

  We study the challenging problem of unsupervised multi-object segmentation on single images. Existing methods, which rely on image reconstruction objectives to learn objectness or leverage pretrained image features to group similar pixels, often succeed only in segmenting simple synthetic objects or discovering a limited number of real-world objects. In this paper, we introduce unMORE, a novel two-stage pipeline designed to identify many complex objects in real-world images. The key to our approach involves explicitly learning three levels of carefully defined object-centric representations in the first stage. Subsequently, our multi-object reasoning module utilizes these learned object priors to discover multiple objects in the second stage. Notably, this reasoning module is entirely network-free and does not require human labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that unMORE significantly outperforms all existing unsupervised methods across 6 real-world benchmark datasets, including the challenging COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art object segmentation results. Remarkably, our method excels in crowded images where all baselines collapse.

  Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines.

  The increasing availability of wearable XR devices opens new perspectives for Egocentric Action Recognition (EAR) systems, which can provide deeper human understanding and situation awareness. However, deploying real-time algorithms on these devices can be challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between portability, battery life, and computational resources. In this work, we systematically analyze the impact of sampling frequency across different input modalities - RGB video and 3D hand pose - on egocentric action recognition performance and CPU usage. By exploring a range of configurations, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that reducing the sampling rate of RGB frames, when complemented with higher-frequency 3D hand pose input, can preserve high accuracy while significantly lowering CPU demands. Notably, we observe up to a 3x reduction in CPU usage with minimal to no loss in recognition performance. This highlights the potential of multimodal input strategies as a viable approach to achieving efficient, real-time EAR on XR devices.

  Visual rating is an essential capability of artificial intelligence (AI) for multi-dimensional quantification of visual content, primarily applied in ordinal regression (OR) tasks such as image quality assessment, facial age estimation, and medical image grading. However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) under-perform in such visual rating ability while also suffering the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In this work, we collect and present STORM, a data collection and benchmark for Stimulating Trustworthy Ordinal Regression Ability of MLLMs for universal visual rating. STORM encompasses 14 ordinal regression datasets across five common visual rating domains, comprising 655K image-level pairs and the corresponding carefully curated VQAs. Importantly, we also propose a coarse-to-fine processing pipeline that dynamically considers label candidates and provides interpretable thoughts, providing MLLMs with a general and trustworthy ordinal thinking paradigm. This benchmark aims to evaluate the all-in-one and zero-shot performance of MLLMs in scenarios requiring understanding of the essential common ordinal relationships of rating labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better fine-tuning strategies. The STORM dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models are available on the following webpage to support further research in this area.

  While recent advances in reinforcement learning have significantly enhanced reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), these techniques remain underexplored in multi-modal LLMs for video captioning. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of GRPO-based RL post-training for video MLLMs, with the goal of enhancing video MLLMs' capability of describing actions in videos. Specifically, we develop the VideoCap-R1, which is prompted to first perform structured thinking that analyzes video subjects with their attributes and actions before generating complete captions, supported by two specialized reward mechanisms: a LLM-free think scorer evaluating the structured thinking quality and a LLM-assisted caption scorer assessing the output quality. The RL training framework effectively establishes the connection between structured reasoning and comprehensive description generation, enabling the model to produce captions with more accurate actions. Our experiments demonstrate that VideoCap-R1 achieves substantial improvements over the Qwen2VL-7B baseline using limited samples (1.5k) across multiple video caption benchmarks (DREAM1K: +4.4 event F1, VDC: +4.2 Acc, CAREBENCH: +3.1 action F1, +6.9 object F1) while consistently outperforming the SFT-trained counterparts, confirming GRPO's superiority in enhancing MLLMs' captioning capabilities.

  Pretrained on web-scale open data, VLMs offer powerful capabilities for solving downstream tasks after being adapted to task-specific labeled data. Yet, data labeling can be expensive and may demand domain expertise. Active Learning (AL) aims to reduce this expense by strategically selecting the most informative data for labeling and model training. Recent AL methods have explored VLMs but have not leveraged publicly available open data, such as VLM's pretraining data. In this work, we leverage such data by retrieving task-relevant examples to augment the task-specific examples. As expected, incorporating them significantly improves AL. Given that our method exploits open-source VLM and open data, we refer to it as Active Learning with Open Resources (ALOR). Additionally, most VLM-based AL methods use prompt tuning (PT) for model adaptation, likely due to its ability to directly utilize pretrained parameters and the assumption that doing so reduces the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. We rigorously compare popular adaptation approaches, including linear probing (LP), finetuning (FT), and contrastive tuning (CT). We reveal two key findings: (1) All adaptation approaches benefit from incorporating retrieved data, and (2) CT resoundingly outperforms other approaches across AL methods. Further analysis of retrieved data reveals a naturally imbalanced distribution of task-relevant classes, exposing inherent biases within the VLM. This motivates our novel Tail First Sampling (TFS) strategy for AL, an embarrassingly simple yet effective method that prioritizes sampling data from underrepresented classes to label. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our final method, contrastively finetuning VLM on both retrieved and TFS-selected labeled data, significantly outperforms existing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present InfoMax, a novel data pruning method, also known as coreset selection, designed to maximize the information content of selected samples while minimizing redundancy. By doing so, InfoMax enhances the overall informativeness of the coreset. The information of individual samples is measured by importance scores, which capture their influence or difficulty in model learning. To quantify redundancy, we use pairwise sample similarities, based on the premise that similar samples contribute similarly to the learning process. We formalize the coreset selection problem as a discrete quadratic programming (DQP) task, with the objective of maximizing the total information content, represented as the sum of individual sample contributions minus the redundancies introduced by similar samples within the coreset. To ensure practical scalability, we introduce an efficient gradient-based solver, complemented by sparsification techniques applied to the similarity matrix and dataset partitioning strategies. This enables InfoMax to seamlessly scale to datasets with millions of samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of InfoMax in various data pruning tasks, including image classification, vision-language pre-training, and instruction tuning for large language models.

  Can freely moving humans or animals themselves serve as calibration targets for multi-camera systems while simultaneously estimating their correspondences across views? We humans can solve this problem by mentally rotating the observed 2D poses and aligning them with those in the target views. Inspired by this cognitive ability, we propose SteerPose, a neural network that performs this rotation of 2D poses into another view. By integrating differentiable matching, SteerPose simultaneously performs extrinsic camera calibration and correspondence search within a single unified framework. We also introduce a novel geometric consistency loss that explicitly ensures that the estimated rotation and correspondences result in a valid translation estimation. Experimental results on diverse in-the-wild datasets of humans and animals validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct the 3D poses of novel animals in multi-camera setups by leveraging off-the-shelf 2D pose estimators and our class-agnostic model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their proficiency in fine-grained video motion understanding remains critically limited. They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore subtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in static images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly for fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion perception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object and camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel zero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as visual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without training. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA, the first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with hierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\Theta}(40K) video clips and {\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves state-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial models. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel zero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset. All the code and annotations will be publicly available.

  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance in various vision-language tasks. However, they often struggle to comprehensively understand Earth Observation (EO) data, which is critical for monitoring the environment and the effects of human activity on it. In this work, we present EarthMind, a novel vision-language framework for multi-granular and multi-sensor EO data understanding. EarthMind features two core components: (1) Spatial Attention Prompting (SAP), which reallocates attention within the LLM to enhance pixel-level understanding; and (2) Cross-modal Fusion, which aligns heterogeneous modalities into a shared space and adaptively reweighs tokens based on their information density for effective fusion. To facilitate multi-sensor fusion evaluation, we propose EarthMind-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 2,000 human-annotated multi-sensor image-question pairs, covering a wide range of perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EarthMind. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on EarthMind-Bench, surpassing GPT-4o despite being only 4B in scale. Moreover, EarthMind outperforms existing methods on multiple public EO benchmarks, showcasing its potential to handle both multi-granular and multi-sensor challenges in a unified framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) often struggle to interpret high-resolution images accurately, where fine-grained details are crucial for complex visual understanding. We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and \textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by \textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution multimodal benchmarks. Code is available at \href{this https URL}{\color{magenta}this http URL}

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual explanation maps enhance the trustworthiness of decisions made by deep learning models and offer valuable guidance for developing new algorithms in image recognition tasks. Class activation maps (CAM) and their variants (e.g., Grad-CAM and Relevance-CAM) have been extensively employed to explore the interpretability of softmax-based convolutional neural networks, which require a fully connected layer as the classifier for decision-making. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to metric learning models, as such models lack a fully connected layer functioning as a classifier. To address this limitation, we propose a novel visual explanation method termed Similar Feature Activation Map (SFAM). This method introduces the channel-wise contribution importance score (CIS) to measure feature importance, derived from the similarity measurement between two image embeddings. The explanation map is constructed by linearly combining the proposed importance weights with the feature map from a CNN model. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that SFAM provides highly promising interpretable visual explanations for CNN models using Euclidean distance or cosine similarity as the similarity metric.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent multi-modal models have shown remarkable versatility in real-world applications. However, their rapid development encounters two critical data challenges. First, the training process requires large-scale datasets, leading to substantial storage and computational costs. Second, these data are typically web-crawled with inevitable noise, i.e., partially mismatched pairs, severely degrading model performance. To these ends, we propose Multi-modal dataset Distillation in the Wild, i.e., MDW, the first framework to distill noisy multi-modal datasets into compact clean ones for effective and efficient model training. Specifically, MDW introduces learnable fine-grained correspondences during distillation and adaptively optimizes distilled data to emphasize correspondence-discriminative regions, thereby enhancing distilled data's information density and efficacy. Moreover, to capture robust cross-modal correspondence prior knowledge from real data, MDW proposes dual-track collaborative learning to avoid the risky data noise, alleviating information loss with certifiable noise tolerance. Extensive experiments validate MDW's theoretical and empirical efficacy with remarkable scalability, surpassing prior methods by over 15% across various compression ratios, highlighting its appealing practicality for applications with diverse efficacy and resource needs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating high-fidelity full-body human interactions with dynamic objects and static scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and animation. Existing methods for human-object interaction often neglect scene context, leading to implausible penetrations, while human-scene interaction approaches struggle to coordinate fine-grained manipulations with long-range navigation. To address these limitations, we propose HOSIG, a novel framework for synthesizing full-body interactions through hierarchical scene perception. Our method decouples the task into three key components: 1) a scene-aware grasp pose generator that ensures collision-free whole-body postures with precise hand-object contact by integrating local geometry constraints, 2) a heuristic navigation algorithm that autonomously plans obstacle-avoiding paths in complex indoor environments via compressed 2D floor maps and dual-component spatial reasoning, and 3) a scene-guided motion diffusion model that generates trajectory-controlled, full-body motions with finger-level accuracy by incorporating spatial anchors and dual-space classifier-free guidance. Extensive experiments on the TRUMANS dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework supports unlimited motion length through autoregressive generation and requires minimal manual intervention. This work bridges the critical gap between scene-aware navigation and dexterous object manipulation, advancing the frontier of embodied interaction synthesis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to provide a pixel-wise scene understanding in Language-aided Audio-Visual Scenes (LAVS). This task requires the model to continuously segment objects referred to by text and audio from a video. Previous dual-modality methods always fail due to the lack of a third modality and the existing triple-modality method struggles with spatio-temporal consistency, leading to the target shift of different frames. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, termed SAM2-LOVE, which integrates textual, audio, and visual representations into a learnable token to prompt and align SAM2 for achieving Ref-AVS in the LAVS. Technically, our approach includes a multimodal fusion module aimed at improving multimodal understanding of SAM2, as well as token propagation and accumulation strategies designed to enhance spatio-temporal consistency without forgetting historical information. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate that SAM2-LOVE outperforms the SOTA by 8.5\% in $\mathcal{J\&F}$ on the Ref-AVS benchmark and showcase the simplicity and effectiveness of the components.

  Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driving world models are used to simulate futures by video generation based on the condition of the current state and actions. However, current models often suffer serious error accumulations when predicting the long-term future, which limits the practical application. Recent studies utilize the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as the backbone of driving world models to improve learning flexibility. However, these models are always trained on short video clips (high fps and short duration), and multiple roll-out generations struggle to produce consistent and reasonable long videos due to the training-inference gap. To this end, we propose several solutions to build a simple yet effective long-term driving world model. First, we hierarchically decouple world model learning into large motion learning and bidirectional continuous motion learning. Then, considering the continuity of driving scenes, we propose a simple distillation method where fine-grained video flows are self-supervised signals for coarse-grained flows. The distillation is designed to improve the coherence of infinite video generation. The coarse-grained and fine-grained modules are coordinated to generate long-term and temporally coherent videos. In the public benchmark NuScenes, compared with the state-of-the-art front-view model, our model improves FVD by $27\%$ and reduces inference time by $85\%$ for the video task of generating 110+ frames. More videos (including 90s duration) are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper considers the problem of utilizing a large-scale text-to-image diffusion model to tackle the challenging Inexact Segmentation (IS) task. Unlike traditional approaches that rely heavily on discriminative-model-based paradigms or dense visual representations derived from internal attention mechanisms, our method focuses on the intrinsic generative priors in Stable Diffusion~(SD). Specifically, we exploit the pattern discrepancies between original images and mask-conditional generated images to facilitate a coarse-to-fine segmentation refinement by establishing a semantic correspondence alignment and updating the foreground probability. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our plug-and-play design, underscoring the potential of leveraging generation discrepancies to model dense representations and encouraging further exploration of generative approaches for solving discriminative tasks.

  Bias has been a constant in face recognition models. Over the years, researchers have looked at it from both the model and the data point of view. However, their approach to mitigation of data bias was limited and lacked insight on the real nature of the problem. Here, in this document, we propose to revise our use of ethnicity labels as a continuous variable instead of a discrete value per identity. We validate our formulation both experimentally and theoretically, showcasing that not all identities from one ethnicity contribute equally to the balance of the dataset; thus, having the same number of identities per ethnicity does not represent a balanced dataset. We further show that models trained on datasets balanced in the continuous space consistently outperform models trained on data balanced in the discrete space. We trained more than 65 different models, and created more than 20 subsets of the original datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Transformer (ViT) models have made breakthroughs in image embedding extraction, which provide state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as zero-shot image classification. However, the models suffer from a high computational burden. In this paper, we propose a novel speed-up method for ViT models called Attention-aware Token Filtering (ATF). ATF consists of two main ideas: a novel token filtering module and a filtering strategy. The token filtering module is introduced between a tokenizer and a transformer encoder of the ViT model, without modifying or fine-tuning of the transformer encoder. The module filters out tokens inputted to the encoder so that it keeps tokens in regions of specific object types dynamically and keeps tokens in regions that statically receive high attention in the transformer encoder. This filtering strategy maintains task accuracy while filtering out tokens inputted to the transformer encoder. Evaluation results on retrieval tasks show that ATF provides $2.8\times$ speed-up to a ViT model, SigLIP, while maintaining the retrieval recall rate.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Preference alignment in diffusion models has primarily focused on benign human preferences (e.g., aesthetic). In this paper, we propose a novel perspective: framing unrestricted adversarial example generation as a problem of aligning with adversary preferences. Unlike benign alignment, adversarial alignment involves two inherently conflicting preferences: visual consistency and attack effectiveness, which often lead to unstable optimization and reward hacking (e.g., reducing visual quality to improve attack success). To address this, we propose APA (Adversary Preferences Alignment), a two-stage framework that decouples conflicting preferences and optimizes each with differentiable rewards. In the first stage, APA fine-tunes LoRA to improve visual consistency using rule-based similarity reward. In the second stage, APA updates either the image latent or prompt embedding based on feedback from a substitute classifier, guided by trajectory-level and step-wise rewards. To enhance black-box transferability, we further incorporate a diffusion augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that APA achieves significantly better attack transferability while maintaining high visual consistency, inspiring further research to approach adversarial attacks from an alignment perspective.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully scaled to billion-scale large text-to-image datasets. However, training such models entails a high training cost, limiting some applications and research usage. To reduce the cost, one promising direction is the incorporation of pre-trained models. The existing method of utilizing pre-trained models for a generator significantly reduced the training cost compared with the other large-scale GANs, but we found the model loses the diversity of generation for a given prompt by a large margin. To build an efficient and high-fidelity text-to-image GAN without compromise, we propose to use two specialized discriminators with Slicing Adversarial Networks (SANs) adapted for text-to-image tasks. Our proposed model, called SCAD, shows a notable enhancement in diversity for a given prompt with better sample fidelity. We also propose to use a metric called Per-Prompt Diversity (PPD) to evaluate the diversity of text-to-image models quantitatively. SCAD achieved a zero-shot FID competitive with the latest large-scale GANs at two orders of magnitude less training cost.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamic scene graph generation extends scene graph generation from images to videos by modeling entity relationships and their temporal evolution. However, existing methods either generate scene graphs from observed frames without explicitly modeling temporal dynamics, or predict only relationships while assuming static entity labels and locations. These limitations hinder effective extrapolation of both entity and relationship dynamics, restricting video scene understanding. We propose Forecasting Dynamic Scene Graphs (FDSG), a novel framework that predicts future entity labels, bounding boxes, and relationships, for unobserved frames, while also generating scene graphs for observed frames. Our scene graph forecast module leverages query decomposition and neural stochastic differential equations to model entity and relationship dynamics. A temporal aggregation module further refines predictions by integrating forecasted and observed information via cross-attention. To benchmark FDSG, we introduce Scene Graph Forecasting, a new task for full future scene graph prediction. Experiments on Action Genome show that FDSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods on dynamic scene graph generation, scene graph anticipation, and scene graph forecasting. Codes will be released upon publication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent endeavors in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) aim to unify visual comprehension and generation. However, these two capabilities remain largely independent, as if they are two separate functions encapsulated within the same model. Consequently, visual comprehension does not enhance visual generation, and the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs have not been fully integrated to revolutionize image generation. In this paper, we propose to enable the collaborative co-evolution of visual comprehension and generation, advancing image generation into an iterative introspective process. We introduce a two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning teaches the MLLM with the foundational ability to generate genuine CoT for visual generation, while reinforcement learning activates its full potential via an exploration-exploitation trade-off. Ultimately, we unlock the Aha moment in visual generation, advancing MLLMs from text-to-image tasks to unified image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only excels in text-to-image generation and image editing, but also functions as a superior image semantic evaluator with enhanced visual comprehension capabilities.

  Accurate surgical phase recognition is crucial for computer-assisted interventions and surgical video analysis. Annotating long surgical videos is labor-intensive, driving research toward leveraging unlabeled data for strong performance with minimal annotations. Although self-supervised learning has gained popularity by enabling large-scale pretraining followed by fine-tuning on small labeled subsets, semi-supervised approaches remain largely underexplored in the surgical domain. In this work, we propose a video transformer-based model with a robust pseudo-labeling framework. Our method incorporates temporal consistency regularization for unlabeled data and contrastive learning with class prototypes, which leverages both labeled data and pseudo-labels to refine the feature space. Through extensive experiments on the private RAMIE (Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy) dataset and the public Cholec80 dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By incorporating unlabeled data, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on RAMIE with a 4.9% accuracy increase and obtain comparable results to full supervision while using only 1/4 of the labeled data on Cholec80. Our findings establish a strong benchmark for semi-supervised surgical phase recognition, paving the way for future research in this domain.

  Accurately recognizing and assessing pain in sheep is key to discern animal health and mitigating harmful situations. However, such accuracy is limited by the ability to manage automatic monitoring of pain in those animals. Facial expression scoring is a widely used and useful method to evaluate pain in both humans and other living beings. Researchers also analyzed the facial expressions of sheep to assess their health state and concluded that facial landmark detection and pain level prediction are essential. For this purpose, we propose a novel weighted graph neural network (WGNN) model to link sheep's detected facial landmarks and define pain levels. Furthermore, we propose a new sheep facial landmarks dataset that adheres to the parameters of the Sheep Facial Expression Scale (SPFES). Currently, there is no comprehensive performance benchmark that specifically evaluates the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) on sheep facial landmark data to detect and measure pain levels. The YOLOv8n detector architecture achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 59.30% with the sheep facial landmarks dataset, among seven other detection models. The WGNN framework has an accuracy of 92.71% for tracking multiple facial parts expressions with the YOLOv8n lightweight on-board device deployment-capable model.

  Video anomaly retrieval aims to localize anomalous events in videos using natural language queries to facilitate public safety. However, existing datasets suffer from severe limitations: (1) data scarcity due to the long-tail nature of real-world anomalies, and (2) privacy constraints that impede large-scale collection. To address the aforementioned issues in one go, we introduce SVTA (Synthetic Video-Text Anomaly benchmark), the first large-scale dataset for cross-modal anomaly retrieval, leveraging generative models to overcome data availability challenges. Specifically, we collect and generate video descriptions via the off-the-shelf LLM (Large Language Model) covering 68 anomaly categories, e.g., throwing, stealing, and shooting. These descriptions encompass common long-tail events. We adopt these texts to guide the video generative model to produce diverse and high-quality videos. Finally, our SVTA involves 41,315 videos (1.36M frames) with paired captions, covering 30 normal activities, e.g., standing, walking, and sports, and 68 anomalous events, e.g., falling, fighting, theft, explosions, and natural disasters. We adopt three widely-used video-text retrieval baselines to comprehensively test our SVTA, revealing SVTA's challenging nature and its effectiveness in evaluating a robust cross-modal retrieval method. SVTA eliminates privacy risks associated with real-world anomaly collection while maintaining realistic scenarios. The dataset demo is available at: [this https URL].

  Recent advancements in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, enabling the creation of high-quality, temporally consistent videos. However, generating high frame-rate (FPS) videos remains a significant challenge due to issues such as flickering and degradation in long sequences, particularly in fast-motion scenarios. Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiencies and limitations in maintaining video quality over extended frames. In this paper, we present a novel, training-free approach for high FPS video generation using pre-trained diffusion models. Our method, DiffuseSlide, introduces a new pipeline that leverages key frames from low FPS videos and applies innovative techniques, including noise re-injection and sliding window latent denoising, to achieve smooth, consistent video outputs without the need for additional fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves video quality, offering enhanced temporal coherence and spatial fidelity. The proposed method is not only computationally efficient but also adaptable to various video generation tasks, making it ideal for applications such as virtual reality, video games, and high-quality content creation.

To bridge this gap, we propose a Context-adaptive sonar image classification framework that leverages advanced image processing techniques to extract and integrate discriminative shadow and highlight features. Our framework introduces a novel shadow-specific classifier and adaptive shadow segmentation, enabling effective classification based on the dominant region. This approach ensures optimal feature representation, improving robustness against noise and occlusions. In addition, we introduce a Region-aware denoising model that enhances sonar image quality by preserving critical structural details while suppressing noise. This model incorporates an explainability-driven optimization strategy, ensuring that denoising is guided by feature importance, thereby improving interpretability and classification reliability. Furthermore, we present S3Simulator+, an extended dataset incorporating naval mine scenarios with physics-informed noise specifically tailored for the underwater sonar domain, fostering the development of robust AI models. By combining novel classification strategies with an enhanced dataset, our work addresses key challenges in sonar image analysis, contributingto the advancement of autonomous underwater perception.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although multi-scale concepts have recently proven useful for recurrent network architectures in the field of optical flow and stereo, they have not been considered for image-based scene flow so far. Hence, based on a single-scale recurrent scene flow backbone, we develop a multi-scale approach that generalizes successful hierarchical ideas from optical flow to image-based scene flow. By considering suitable concepts for the feature and the context encoder, the overall coarse-to-fine framework and the training loss, we succeed to design a scene flow approach that outperforms the current state of the art on KITTI and Spring by 8.7%(3.89 vs. 4.26) and 65.8% (9.13 vs. 26.71), respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Color propagation aims to extend local color edits to similar regions across the input image. Conventional approaches often rely on low-level visual cues such as color, texture, or lightness to measure pixel similarity, making it difficult to achieve content-aware color propagation. While some recent approaches attempt to introduce semantic information into color editing, but often lead to unnatural, global color change in color adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we present a semantic palette-guided approach for color propagation. We first extract a semantic palette from an input image. Then, we solve an edited palette by minimizing a well-designed energy function based on user edits. Finally, local edits are accurately propagated to regions that share similar semantics via the solved palette. Our approach enables efficient yet accurate pixel-level color editing and ensures that local color changes are propagated in a content-aware manner. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Leveraging the powerful generation capability of large-scale pretrained text-to-image models, training-free methods have demonstrated impressive image editing results. Conventional diffusion-based methods, as well as recent rectified flow (RF)-based methods, typically reverse synthesis trajectories by gradually adding noise to clean images, during which the noisy latent at the current timestep is used to approximate that at the next timesteps, introducing accumulated drift and degrading reconstruction accuracy. Considering the fact that in RF the noisy latent is estimated through direct interpolation between Gaussian noises and clean images at each timestep, we propose Direct Noise Alignment (DNA), which directly refines the desired Gaussian noise in the noise domain, significantly reducing the error accumulation in previous methods. Specifically, DNA estimates the velocity field of the interpolated noised latent at each timestep and adjusts the Gaussian noise by computing the difference between the predicted and expected velocity field. We validate the effectiveness of DNA and reveal its relationship with existing RF-based inversion methods. Additionally, we introduce a Mobile Velocity Guidance (MVG) to control the target prompt-guided generation process, balancing image background preservation and target object editability. DNA and MVG collectively constitute our proposed method, namely DNAEdit. Finally, we introduce DNA-Bench, a long-prompt benchmark, to evaluate the performance of advanced image editing models. Experimental results demonstrate that our DNAEdit achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art text-guided editing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) task aims to identify various detailed attributes of an individual, such as clothing, accessories, and gender. To enhance PAR performance, a model must capture features ranging from coarse-grained global attributes (e.g., for identifying gender) to fine-grained local details (e.g., for recognizing accessories) that may appear in diverse regions. Recent research suggests that body part representation can enhance the model's robustness and accuracy, but these methods are often restricted to attribute classes within fixed horizontal regions, leading to degraded performance when attributes appear in varying or unexpected body locations. In this paper, we propose Visual and Textual Attribute Alignment with Attribute Prompting for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition, dubbed as ViTA-PAR, to enhance attribute recognition through specialized multimodal prompting and vision-language alignment. We introduce visual attribute prompts that capture global-to-local semantics, enabling diverse attribute representations. To enrich textual embeddings, we design a learnable prompt template, termed person and attribute context prompting, to learn person and attributes context. Finally, we align visual and textual attribute features for effective fusion. ViTA-PAR is validated on four PAR benchmarks, achieving competitive performance with efficient inference. We release our code and model atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Active-stereo-based 3D shape measurement is crucial for various purposes, such as industrial inspection, reverse engineering, and medical systems, due to its strong ability to accurately acquire the shape of textureless objects. Active stereo systems typically consist of a camera and a pattern projector, tightly fixed to each other, and precise calibration between a camera and a projector is required, which in turn decreases the usability of the system. If a camera and a projector can be freely moved during shape scanning process, it will drastically increase the convenience of the usability of the system. To realize it, we propose a technique to recover the shape of the target object by capturing multiple images while both the camera and the projector are in motion, and their relative poses are auto-calibrated by our neural signed-distance-field (NeuralSDF) using novel volumetric differential rendering technique. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated by performing 3D reconstruction using both synthetic and real images.

  Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) has emerged as a critical field in document intelligence, enabling automated extraction of key information from complex documents across domains such as medical, financial, and educational applications. However, form-like documents pose unique challenges due to their complex layouts, multi-stakeholder involvement, and high structural variability. Addressing these issues, the VRD-IU Competition was introduced, focusing on extracting and localizing key information from multi-format forms within the Form-NLU dataset, which includes digital, printed, and handwritten documents. This paper presents insights from the competition, which featured two tracks: Track A, emphasizing entity-based key information retrieval, and Track B, targeting end-to-end key information localization from raw document images. With over 20 participating teams, the competition showcased various state-of-the-art methodologies, including hierarchical decomposition, transformer-based retrieval, multimodal feature fusion, and advanced object detection techniques. The top-performing models set new benchmarks in VRDU, providing valuable insights into document intelligence.

  Autoregressive video models offer distinct advantages over bidirectional diffusion models in creating interactive video content and supporting streaming applications with arbitrary duration. In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-Fidelity 3D scene reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving by enabling novel data generation from existing datasets. This allows simulating safety-critical scenarios and augmenting training datasets without incurring further data collection costs. While recent advances in radiance fields have demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction and sensor data synthesis using cameras and LiDAR, their potential for radar remains largely unexplored. Radar is crucial for autonomous driving due to its robustness in adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow, where optical sensors often struggle. Although the state-of-the-art radar-based neural representation shows promise for 3D driving scene reconstruction, it performs poorly in scenarios with significant radar noise, including receiver saturation and multipath reflection. Moreover, it is limited to synthesizing preprocessed, noise-excluded radar images, failing to address realistic radar data synthesis. To address these limitations, this paper proposes RadarSplat, which integrates Gaussian Splatting with novel radar noise modeling to enable realistic radar data synthesis and enhanced 3D reconstruction. Compared to the state-of-the-art, RadarSplat achieves superior radar image synthesis (+3.4 PSNR / 2.6x SSIM) and improved geometric reconstruction (-40% RMSE / 1.5x Accuracy), demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity radar data and scene reconstruction.

  Multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for sports analytics, enabling performance evaluation and tactical insights. However, tracking in sports is challenging due to fast movements, occlusions, and camera shifts. Traditional tracking-by-detection methods require extensive tuning, while segmentation-based approaches struggle with track processing. We propose McByte, a tracking-by-detection framework that integrates temporally propagated segmentation mask as an association cue to improve robustness without per-video tuning. Unlike many existing methods, McByte does not require training, relying solely on pre-trained models and object detectors commonly used in the community. Evaluated on SportsMOT, DanceTrack, SoccerNet-tracking 2022 and MOT17, McByte demonstrates strong performance across sports and general pedestrian tracking. Our results highlight the benefits of mask propagation for a more adaptable and generalizable MOT approach. Code will be made available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial reasoning remains a critical yet underdeveloped capability in existing vision-language models (VLMs), especially for Spatial Visual Question Answering (Spatial VQA) tasks that require understanding relative positions, distances, and object configurations. Inspired by the R1 paradigm introduced in DeepSeek-R1, which enhances reasoning in language models through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we propose SVQA-R1, the first framework to extend R1-style training to spatial VQA. In particular, we introduce Spatial-GRPO, a novel group-wise RL strategy that constructs view-consistent rewards by perturbing spatial relations between objects, e.g., mirror flipping, thereby encouraging the model to develop a consistent and grounded understanding of space. Our model, SVQA-R1, not only achieves dramatically improved accuracy on spatial VQA benchmarks but also exhibits interpretable reasoning paths even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data. Extensive experiments and visualization demonstrate the effectiveness of SVQA-R1 across multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) generation model has made significant advancements, resulting in high-quality images aligned with an input prompt. However, despite T2I generation's ability to generate fine-grained images, it still faces challenges in accurately generating images when the input prompt contains complex concepts, especially human pose. In this paper, we propose PointT2I, a framework that effectively generates images that accurately correspond to the human pose described in the prompt by using a large language model (LLM). PointT2I consists of three components: Keypoint generation, Image generation, and Feedback system. The keypoint generation uses an LLM to directly generate keypoints corresponding to a human pose, solely based on the input prompt, without external references. Subsequently, the image generation produces images based on both the text prompt and the generated keypoints to accurately reflect the target pose. To refine the outputs of the preceding stages, we incorporate an LLM-based feedback system that assesses the semantic consistency between the generated contents and the given prompts. Our framework is the first approach to leveraging LLM for keypoints-guided image generation without any fine-tuning, producing accurate pose-aligned images based solely on textual prompts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning-based food image classification enables precise identification of food categories, further facilitating accurate nutritional analysis. However, real-world food images often show a skewed distribution, with some food types being more prevalent than others. This class imbalance can be problematic, causing models to favor the majority (head) classes with overall performance degradation for the less common (tail) classes. Recently, synthetic data augmentation using diffusion-based generative models has emerged as a promising solution to address this issue. By generating high-quality synthetic images, these models can help uniformize the data distribution, potentially improving classification performance. However, existing approaches face challenges: fine-tuning-based methods need a uniformly distributed dataset, while pre-trained model-based approaches often overlook inter-class separation in synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a two-stage synthetic data augmentation framework, leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for long-tailed food classification. We generate a reference set conditioned by a positive prompt on the generation target and then select a class that shares similar features with the generation target as a negative prompt. Subsequently, we generate a synthetic augmentation set using positive and negative prompt conditions by a combined sampling strategy that promotes intra-class diversity and inter-class separation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on two long-tailed food benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance compared to previous works in terms of top-1 accuracy.

  _Cong Guan, Osamu Yoshie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing deraining models process all rainy images within a single network. However, different rain patterns have significant variations, which makes it challenging for a single network to handle diverse types of raindrops and streaks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-driven rain perception network (CLIP-RPN) that leverages CLIP to automatically perceive rain patterns by computing visual-language matching scores and adaptively routing to sub-networks to handle different rain patterns, such as varying raindrop densities, streak orientations, and rainfall intensity. CLIP-RPN establishes semantic-aware rain pattern recognition through CLIP's cross-modal visual-language alignment capabilities, enabling automatic identification of precipitation characteristics across different rain scenarios. This rain pattern awareness drives an adaptive subnetwork routing mechanism where specialized processing branches are dynamically activated based on the detected rain type, significantly enhancing the model's capacity to handle diverse rainfall conditions. Furthermore, within sub-networks of CLIP-RPN, we introduce a mask-guided cross-attention mechanism (MGCA) that predicts precise rain masks at multi-scale to facilitate contextual interactions between rainy regions and clean background areas by cross-attention. We also introduces a dynamic loss scheduling mechanism (DLS) to adaptively adjust the gradients for the optimization process of CLIP-RPN. Compared with the commonly used $l_1$ or $l_2$ loss, DLS is more compatible with the inherent dynamics of the network training process, thus achieving enhanced outcomes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, particularly excelling in complex mixed datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a target driven adaptive (TDA) loss to enhance the performance of infrared small target detection (IRSTD). Prior works have used loss functions, such as binary cross-entropy loss and IoU loss, to train segmentation models for IRSTD. Minimizing these loss functions guides models to extract pixel-level features or global image context. However, they have two issues: improving detection performance for local regions around the targets and enhancing robustness to small scale and low local contrast. To address these issues, the proposed TDA loss introduces a patch-based mechanism, and an adaptive adjustment strategy to scale and local contrast. The proposed TDA loss leads the model to focus on local regions around the targets and pay particular attention to targets with smaller scales and lower local contrast. We evaluate the proposed method on three datasets for IRSTD. The results demonstrate that the proposed TDA loss achieves better detection performance than existing losses on these datasets.

  This paper rethinks image histogram matching (HM) and proposes a differentiable and parametric HM preprocessing for a downstream classifier. Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated remarkable achievements in classification tasks. However, they often exhibit degraded performance on low-contrast images captured under adverse weather conditions. To maintain classifier performance under low-contrast images, histogram equalization (HE) is commonly used. HE is a special case of HM using a uniform distribution as a target pixel value distribution. In this paper, we focus on the shape of the target pixel value distribution. Compared to a uniform distribution, a single, well-designed distribution could have potential to improve the performance of the downstream classifier across various adverse weather conditions. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a differentiable and parametric HM that optimizes the target distribution using the loss function of the downstream classifier. This method addresses pixel value imbalances by transforming input images with arbitrary distributions into a target distribution optimized for the classifier. Our HM is trained on only normal weather images using the classifier. Experimental results show that a classifier trained with our proposed HM outperforms conventional preprocessing methods under adverse weather conditions.

  We aim to detect the class and orientation of a vehicle by training a model with synthetic data. However, the distribution of the classes in the training data is imbalanced, and the model trained on the synthetic image is difficult to predict in real-world images. We propose a two-stage detection model with photo-realistic image generation to tackle this issue. Our model mainly takes four steps to detect the class and orientation of the vehicle. (1) It builds a table containing the image, class, and location information of objects in the image, (2) transforms the synthetic images into real-world images style, and merges them into the meta table. (3) Classify vehicle class and orientation using images from the meta-table. (4) Finally, the vehicle class and orientation are detected by combining the pre-extracted location information and the predicted classes. We achieved 4th place in IEEE BigData Challenge 2022 Vehicle class and Orientation Detection (VOD) with our approach.

  Ultra-high-resolution image synthesis holds significant potential, yet remains an underexplored challenge due to the absence of standardized benchmarks and computational constraints. In this paper, we establish Aesthetic-4K, a meticulously curated dataset containing dedicated training and evaluation subsets specifically designed for comprehensive research on ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. This dataset consists of high-quality 4K images accompanied by descriptive captions generated by GPT-4o. Furthermore, we propose Diffusion-4K, an innovative framework for the direct generation of ultra-high-resolution images. Our approach incorporates the Scale Consistent Variational Auto-Encoder (SC-VAE) and Wavelet-based Latent Fine-tuning (WLF), which are designed for efficient visual token compression and the capture of intricate details in ultra-high-resolution images, thereby facilitating direct training with photorealistic 4K data. This method is applicable to various latent diffusion models and demonstrates its efficacy in synthesizing highly detailed 4K images. Additionally, we propose novel metrics, namely the GLCM Score and Compression Ratio, to assess the texture richness and fine details in local patches, in conjunction with holistic measures such as FID, Aesthetics, and CLIPScore, enabling a thorough and multifaceted evaluation of ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. Consequently, Diffusion-4K achieves impressive performance in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, particularly when powered by state-of-the-art large-scale diffusion models (eg, Flux-12B).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have significantly advanced promptable image segmentation in computer vision. However, extending these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges, particularly in ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations, resulting in huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this paper, we introduce SAM-I2V, an effective image-to-video upgradation method for cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS, significantly reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this, we introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video perception, (ii) a memory filtering strategy that selects the most relevant past frames for more effective utilization of historical information, and (iii) a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% of SAM 2's performance while using only 0.2% of its training cost. Our work presents a resource-efficient pathway to PVS, lowering barriers for further research in PVS model design and enabling broader applications and advancements in the field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video understanding is fundamental to tasks such as action recognition, video reasoning, and robotic control. Early video understanding methods based on large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically adopt a single-pass reasoning paradigm without dynamic feedback, limiting the model's capacity to self-correct and adapt in complex scenarios. Recent efforts have attempted to address this limitation by incorporating reward models and reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning, or by employing tool-agent frameworks. However, these approaches face several challenges, including high annotation costs, reward signals that fail to capture real-time reasoning states, and low inference efficiency. To overcome these issues, we propose ReAgent-V, a novel agentic video understanding framework that integrates efficient frame selection with real-time reward generation during inference. These reward signals not only guide iterative answer refinement through a multi-perspective reflection mechanism-adjusting predictions from conservative, neutral, and aggressive viewpoints-but also enable automatic filtering of high-quality data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO). ReAgent-V is lightweight, modular, and extensible, supporting flexible tool integration tailored to diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets across three core applications-video understanding, video reasoning enhancement, and vision-language-action model alignment-demonstrate significant gains in generalization and reasoning, with improvements of up to 6.9%, 2.1%, and 9.8%, respectively, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) incorporate heterogeneous modalities into LLMs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of diverse scenarios and objects. Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic reasoning capacities.

  Recent progress in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled effective vision-language reasoning, yet the ability to understand video content remains constrained by suboptimal frame selection strategies. Existing approaches often rely on static heuristics or external retrieval modules to feed frame information into video-LLMs, which may fail to provide the query-relevant information. In this work, we introduce ReFoCUS (Reinforcement-guided Frame Optimization for Contextual UnderStanding), a novel frame-level policy optimization framework that shifts the optimization target from textual responses to visual input selection. ReFoCUS learns a frame selection policy via reinforcement learning, using reward signals derived from a reference LMM to reflect the model's intrinsic preferences for frames that best support temporally grounded responses. To efficiently explore the large combinatorial frame space, we employ an autoregressive, conditional selection architecture that ensures temporal coherence while reducing complexity. Our approach does not require explicit supervision at the frame-level and consistently improves reasoning performance across multiple video QA benchmarks, highlighting the benefits of aligning frame selection with model-internal utility.

  Steering vision foundation models at inference time without retraining or access to large labeled datasets is a desirable yet challenging objective, particularly in dynamic or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we introduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that guides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features learned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data. Specifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on CUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet. We further propose VS2++, a retrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features using pseudo-labeled neighbors at inference time. With oracle positive/negative sets, VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over CLIP zero-shot of up to 21.44% on CIFAR-100, 7.08% on CUB-200, and 20.47% on Tiny-ImageNet. Interestingly, VS2 and VS2++ raise per-class accuracy by up to 25% and 38%, respectively, showing that sparse steering benefits specific classes by disambiguating visually or taxonomically proximate categories rather than providing a uniform boost. Finally, to better align the sparse features learned through the SAE reconstruction task with those relevant for downstream performance, we propose Prototype-Aligned Sparse Steering (PASS). By incorporating a prototype-alignment loss during SAE training, using labels only during training while remaining fully test-time unsupervised, PASS consistently, though modestly, outperforms VS2, achieving a 6.12% gain over VS2 only on CIFAR-100 with ViT-B/32.

  Multispectral satellite images play a vital role in agriculture, fisheries, and environmental monitoring. However, their high dimensionality, large data volumes, and diverse spatial resolutions across multiple channels pose significant challenges for data compression and analysis. This paper presents ImpliSat, a unified framework specifically designed to address these challenges through efficient compression and reconstruction of multispectral satellite data. ImpliSat leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model satellite images as continuous functions over coordinate space, capturing fine spatial details across varying spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a Fourier modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the spectral and spatial characteristics of each band, ensuring optimal compression while preserving critical image details.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gathering enough images to train a deep computer vision model is a constant challenge. Unfortunately, collecting images from unknown sources can leave your model s behavior at risk of being manipulated by a dirty-label or clean-label attack unless the images are properly inspected. Manually inspecting each image-label pair is impractical and common poison-detection methods that involve re-training your model can be time consuming. This research uses GAN discriminators to protect a single class against mislabeled and different levels of modified images. The effect of said perturbation on a basic convolutional neural network classifier is also included for reference. The results suggest that after training on a single class, GAN discriminator s confidence scores can provide a threshold to identify mislabeled images and identify 100% of the tested poison starting at a perturbation epsilon magnitude of 0.20, after decision threshold calibration using in-class samples. Developers can use this report as a basis to train their own discriminators to protect high valued classes in their CV models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This review provides an in-depth exploration of the field of animal action recognition, focusing on coarse-grained (CG) and fine-grained (FG) techniques. The primary aim is to examine the current state of research in animal behaviour recognition and to elucidate the unique challenges associated with recognising subtle animal actions in outdoor environments. These challenges differ significantly from those encountered in human action recognition due to factors such as non-rigid body structures, frequent occlusions, and the lack of large-scale, annotated datasets. The review begins by discussing the evolution of human action recognition, a more established field, highlighting how it progressed from broad, coarse actions in controlled settings to the demand for fine-grained recognition in dynamic environments. This shift is particularly relevant for animal action recognition, where behavioural variability and environmental complexity present unique challenges that human-centric models cannot fully address. The review then underscores the critical differences between human and animal action recognition, with an emphasis on high intra-species variability, unstructured datasets, and the natural complexity of animal habitats. Techniques like spatio-temporal deep learning frameworks (e.g., SlowFast) are evaluated for their effectiveness in animal behaviour analysis, along with the limitations of existing datasets. By assessing the strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies and introducing a recently-published dataset, the review outlines future directions for advancing fine-grained action recognition, aiming to improve accuracy and generalisability in behaviour analysis across species.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Facial expression recognition (FER) is a fundamental task in affective computing with applications in human-computer interaction, mental health analysis, and behavioral understanding. In this paper, we propose SMILE-VLM, a self-supervised vision-language model for 3D/4D FER that unifies multiview visual representation learning with natural language supervision. SMILE-VLM learns robust, semantically aligned, and view-invariant embeddings by proposing three core components: multiview decorrelation via a Barlow Twins-style loss, vision-language contrastive alignment, and cross-modal redundancy minimization. Our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. We further extend SMILE-VLM to the task of 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) to recognize the subtle affective cues. The extensive results demonstrate that SMILE-VLM not only surpasses existing unsupervised methods but also matches or exceeds supervised baselines, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution for expressive facial behavior understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  David Marr's seminal theory of human perception stipulates that visual processing is a multi-stage process, prioritizing the derivation of boundary and surface properties before forming semantic object representations. In contrast, contrastive representation learning frameworks typically bypass this explicit multi-stage approach, defining their objective as the direct learning of a semantic representation space for objects. While effective in general contexts, this approach sacrifices the inductive biases of vision, leading to slower convergence speed and learning shortcut resulting in texture bias. In this work, we demonstrate that leveraging Marr's multi-stage theory-by first constructing boundary and surface-level representations using perceptual constructs from early visual processing stages and subsequently training for object semantics-leads to 2x faster convergence on ResNet18, improved final representations on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object recognition, and enhanced robustness and out-of-distribution capability. Together, we propose a pretraining stage before the general contrastive representation pretraining to further enhance the final representation quality and reduce the overall convergence time via inductive bias from human vision systems.

  Text-to-video diffusion models are notoriously limited in their ability to model temporal aspects such as motion, physics, and dynamic interactions. Existing approaches address this limitation by retraining the model or introducing external conditioning signals to enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we explore whether a meaningful temporal representation can be extracted directly from the predictions of a pre-trained model without any additional training or auxiliary inputs. We introduce \textbf{FlowMo}, a novel training-free guidance method that enhances motion coherence using only the model's own predictions in each diffusion step. FlowMo first derives an appearance-debiased temporal representation by measuring the distance between latents corresponding to consecutive frames. This highlights the implicit temporal structure predicted by the model. It then estimates motion coherence by measuring the patch-wise variance across the temporal dimension and guides the model to reduce this variance dynamically during sampling. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-video models demonstrate that FlowMo significantly improves motion coherence without sacrificing visual quality or prompt alignment, offering an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing the temporal fidelity of pre-trained video diffusion models.

  Surgical triplet detection has emerged as a pivotal task in surgical video analysis, with significant implications for performance assessment and the training of novice surgeons. However, existing datasets such as CholecT50 exhibit critical limitations: they lack precise spatial bounding box annotations, provide inconsistent and clinically ungrounded temporal labels, and rely on a single data source, which limits modelthis http URLaddress these shortcomings, we introduce ProstaTD, a large-scale, multi-institutional dataset for surgical triplet detection, developed from the technically demanding domain of robot-assisted prostatectomy. ProstaTD offers clinically defined temporal boundaries and high-precision bounding box annotations for each structured triplet action. The dataset comprises 60,529 video frames and 165,567 annotated triplet instances, collected from 21 surgeries performed across multiple institutions, reflecting a broad range of surgical practices and intraoperative conditions. The annotation process was conducted under rigorous medical supervision and involved more than 50 contributors, including practicing surgeons and medically trained annotators, through multiple iterative phases of labeling and verification. ProstaTD is the largest and most diverse surgical triplet dataset to date, providing a robust foundation for fair benchmarking, the development of reliable surgical AI systems, and scalable tools for procedural training.

  Many motion-centric video analysis tasks, such as atomic actions, detecting atypical motor behavior in individuals with autism, or analyzing articulatory motion in real-time MRI of human speech, require efficient and interpretable temporal modeling. Capturing temporal dynamics is a central challenge in video analysis, often requiring significant computational resources and fine-grained annotations that are not widely available. This paper presents MOOSE (Motion Flow Over Spatial Space), a novel temporally-centric video encoder explicitly integrating optical flow with spatial embeddings to model temporal information efficiently, inspired by human perception of motion. Unlike prior models, MOOSE takes advantage of rich, widely available pre-trained visual and optical flow encoders instead of training video models from scratch. This significantly reduces computational complexity while enhancing temporal interpretability. Our primary contributions includes (1) proposing a computationally efficient temporally-centric architecture for video understanding (2) demonstrating enhanced interpretability in modeling temporal dynamics; and (3) achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks, including clinical, medical, and standard action recognition datasets, confirming the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

  The escalating demand for medical image interpretation underscores the critical need for advanced artificial intelligence solutions to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of radiological diagnoses. This paper introduces CXR-PathFinder, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-centric foundation model specifically engineered for automated chest X-ray (CXR) report generation. We propose a unique training paradigm, Clinician-Guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (CGAFT), which meticulously integrates expert clinical feedback into an adversarial learning framework to mitigate factual inconsistencies and improve diagnostic precision. Complementing this, our Knowledge Graph Augmentation Module (KGAM) acts as an inference-time safeguard, dynamically verifying generated medical statements against authoritative knowledge bases to minimize hallucinations and ensure standardized terminology. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of millions of paired CXR images and expert reports, our experiments demonstrate that CXR-PathFinder significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art medical vision-language models across various quantitative metrics, including clinical accuracy (Macro F1 (14): 46.5, Micro F1 (14): 59.5). Furthermore, blinded human evaluation by board-certified radiologists confirms CXR-PathFinder's superior clinical utility, completeness, and accuracy, establishing its potential as a reliable and efficient aid for radiological practice. The developed method effectively balances high diagnostic fidelity with computational efficiency, providing a robust solution for automated medical report generation.

  World models serve as essential building blocks toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), enabling intelligent agents to predict future states and plan actions by simulating complex physical interactions. However, existing interactive models primarily predict visual observations, thereby neglecting crucial hidden states like geometric structures and spatial coherence. This leads to rapid error accumulation and temporal inconsistency. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepVerse, a novel 4D interactive world model explicitly incorporating geometric predictions from previous timesteps into current predictions conditioned on actions. Experiments demonstrate that by incorporating explicit geometric constraints, DeepVerse captures richer spatio-temporal relationships and underlying physical dynamics. This capability significantly reduces drift and enhances temporal consistency, enabling the model to reliably generate extended future sequences and achieve substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, visual realism, and scene rationality. Furthermore, our method provides an effective solution for geometry-aware memory retrieval, effectively preserving long-term spatial consistency. We validate the effectiveness of DeepVerse across diverse scenarios, establishing its capacity for high-fidelity, long-horizon predictions grounded in geometry-aware dynamics.

  We pose keystep recognition as a node classification task, and propose a flexible graph-learning framework for fine-grained keystep recognition that is able to effectively leverage long-term dependencies in egocentric videos. Our approach, termed GLEVR, consists of constructing a graph where each video clip of the egocentric video corresponds to a node. The constructed graphs are sparse and computationally efficient, outperforming existing larger models substantially. We further leverage alignment between egocentric and exocentric videos during training for improved inference on egocentric videos, as well as adding automatic captioning as an additional modality. We consider each clip of each exocentric video (if available) or video captions as additional nodes during training. We examine several strategies to define connections across these nodes. We perform extensive experiments on the Ego-Exo4D dataset and show that our proposed flexible graph-based framework notably outperforms existing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process a large number of visual tokens, leading to significant computational costs and inefficiency. Previous works generally assume that all visual tokens are necessary in the shallow layers of LLMs, and therefore token compression typically occurs in intermediate layers. In contrast, our study reveals an interesting insight: with proper selection, token compression is feasible at the input stage of LLM with negligible performance loss. Specifically, we reveal that explainability methods can effectively evaluate the importance of each visual token with respect to the given instruction, which can well guide the token compression. Furthermore, we propose to learn a mapping from the attention map of the first LLM layer to the explanation results, thereby avoiding the need for a full inference pass and facilitating practical deployment. Interestingly, this mapping can be learned using a simple and lightweight convolutional network, whose training is efficient and independent of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on 10 image and video benchmarks across three leading MLLMs (Qwen2-VL, LLaVA-OneVision, and VILA1.5) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, e.g., pruning 50% visual tokens while retaining more than 96% of the original performance across all benchmarks for all these three MLLMs. It also exhibits strong generalization, even when the number of tokens in inference far exceeds that used in training.

  Instruction tuning has been central to the success of recent vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains expensive-requiring large-scale datasets, high-quality annotations, and large compute budgets. We propose PRioritized cOncept learninG via Relative Error-driven Sample Selection (PROGRESS), a data- and compute-efficient framework that enables VLMs to dynamically select what to learn next based on their evolving needs during training. At each stage, the model tracks its learning progress across skills and selects the most informative samples-those it has not already mastered and that are not too difficult to learn at the current stage of training. This strategy effectively controls skill acquisition and the order in which skills are learned. Specifically, we sample from skills showing the highest learning progress, prioritizing those with the most rapid improvement. Unlike prior methods, PROGRESS requires no upfront answer annotations, queries answers only on a need basis, avoids reliance on additional supervision from auxiliary VLMs, and does not require compute-heavy gradient computations for data selection. Experiments across multiple instruction-tuning datasets of varying scales demonstrate that PROGRESS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with much less data and supervision. Additionally, we show strong cross-architecture generalization and transferability to larger models, validating PROGRESS as a scalable solution for efficient learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite notable advancements in multimodal reasoning, leading Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still underperform on vision-centric multimodal reasoning tasks in general scenarios. This shortfall stems from their predominant reliance on logic- and knowledge-based slow thinking strategies, while effective for domains like math and science, fail to integrate visual information effectively during reasoning. Consequently, these models often fail to adequately ground visual cues, resulting in suboptimal performance in tasks that require multiple plausible visual interpretations and inferences. To address this, we present GThinker (General Thinker), a novel reasoning MLLM excelling in multimodal reasoning across general scenarios, mathematics, and science. GThinker introduces Cue-Rethinking, a flexible reasoning pattern that grounds inferences in visual cues and iteratively reinterprets these cues to resolve inconsistencies. Building on this pattern, we further propose a two-stage training pipeline, including pattern-guided cold start and incentive reinforcement learning, designed to enable multimodal reasoning capabilities across domains. Furthermore, to support the training, we construct GThinker-11K, comprising 7K high-quality, iteratively-annotated reasoning paths and 4K curated reinforcement learning samples, filling the data gap toward general multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GThinker achieves 81.5% on the challenging comprehensive multimodal reasoning benchmark M$^3$CoT, surpassing the latest O4-mini model. It also shows an average improvement of 2.1% on general scenario multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining on-par performance in mathematical reasoning compared to counterpart advanced reasoning models.

  Purpose: Accurate segmentation of clinical target volumes (CTV) and organs-at-risk is crucial for optimizing gynecologic brachytherapy (GYN-BT) treatment planning. However, anatomical variability, low soft-tissue contrast in CT imaging, and limited annotated datasets pose significant challenges. This study presents GynBTNet, a novel multi-stage learning framework designed to enhance segmentation performance through self-supervised pretraining and hierarchical fine-tuning strategies. Methods: GynBTNet employs a three-stage training strategy: (1) self-supervised pretraining on large-scale CT datasets using sparse submanifold convolution to capture robust anatomical representations, (2) supervised fine-tuning on a comprehensive multi-organ segmentation dataset to refine feature extraction, and (3) task-specific fine-tuning on a dedicated GYN-BT dataset to optimize segmentation performance for clinical applications. The model was evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and Average Surface Distance (ASD). Results: Our GynBTNet achieved superior segmentation performance, significantly outperforming nnU-Net and Swin-UNETR. Notably, it yielded a DSC of 0.837 +/- 0.068 for CTV, 0.940 +/- 0.052 for the bladder, 0.842 +/- 0.070 for the rectum, and 0.871 +/- 0.047 for the uterus, with reduced HD95 and ASD compared to baseline models. Self-supervised pretraining led to consistent performance improvements, particularly for structures with complex boundaries. However, segmentation of the sigmoid colon remained challenging, likely due to anatomical ambiguities and inter-patient variability. Statistical significance analysis confirmed that GynBTNet's improvements were significant compared to baseline models.

  In this paper, we propose an Aligned Contrastive Learning (ACL) algorithm to address the long-tailed recognition problem. Our findings indicate that while multi-view training boosts the performance, contrastive learning does not consistently enhance model generalization as the number of views increases. Through theoretical gradient analysis of supervised contrastive learning (SCL), we identify gradient conflicts, and imbalanced attraction and repulsion gradients between positive and negative pairs as the underlying issues. Our ACL algorithm is designed to eliminate these problems and demonstrates strong performance across multiple benchmarks. We validate the effectiveness of ACL through experiments on long-tailed CIFAR, ImageNet, Places, and iNaturalist datasets. Results show that ACL achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

  Identification of a person is central in forensic science, security, and healthcare. Methods such as iris scanning and genomic profiling are more accurate but expensive, time-consuming, and more difficult to implement. This study focuses on the relationship between the fingerprint patterns and the ABO blood group as a biometric identification tool. A total of 200 subjects were included in the study, and fingerprint types (loops, whorls, and arches) and blood groups were compared. Associations were evaluated with statistical tests, including chi-square and Pearson correlation. The study found that the loops were the most common fingerprint pattern and the O+ blood group was the most prevalent. Even though there was some associative pattern, there was no statistically significant difference in the fingerprint patterns of different blood groups. Overall, the results indicate that blood group data do not significantly improve personal identification when used in conjunction with fingerprinting. Although the study shows weak correlation, it may emphasize the efforts of multi-modal based biometric systems in enhancing the current biometric systems. Future studies may focus on larger and more diverse samples, and possibly machine learning and additional biometrics to improve identification methods. This study addresses an element of the ever-changing nature of the fields of forensic science and biometric identification, highlighting the importance of resilient analytical methods for personal identification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive "fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly available.

  Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental Low-Level Vision (LLV) task that synthesizes intermediate frames between existing ones while maintaining spatial and temporal coherence. VFI techniques have evolved from classical motion compensation-based approach to deep learning-based approach, including kernel-, flow-, hybrid-, phase-, GAN-, Transformer-, Mamba-, and more recently diffusion model-based approach. We introduce AceVFI, the most comprehensive survey on VFI to date, covering over 250+ papers across these approaches. We systematically organize and describe VFI methodologies, detailing the core principles, design assumptions, and technical characteristics of each approach. We categorize the learning paradigm of VFI methods namely, Center-Time Frame Interpolation (CTFI) and Arbitrary-Time Frame Interpolation (ATFI). We analyze key challenges of VFI such as large motion, occlusion, lighting variation, and non-linear motion. In addition, we review standard datasets, loss functions, evaluation metrics. We examine applications of VFI including event-based, cartoon, medical image VFI and joint VFI with other LLV tasks. We conclude by outlining promising future research directions to support continued progress in the field. This survey aims to serve as a unified reference for both newcomers and experts seeking a deep understanding of modern VFI landscapes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification has been greatly promoted by deep neural networks. However,current deep learning-based PolSAR classification methods encounter difficulties due to its dependence on extensive labeled data and the computational inefficiency of architectures like Transformers. This paper presents ECP-Mamba, an efficient framework integrating multi-scale self-supervised contrastive learning with a state space model (SSM) backbone. Specifically, ECP-Mamba addresses annotation scarcity through a multi-scale predictive pretext task based on local-to-global feature correspondences, which uses a simplified self-distillation paradigm without negative sample pairs. To enhance computational efficiency,the Mamba architecture (a selective SSM) is first tailored for pixel-wise PolSAR classification task by designing a spiral scan strategy. This strategy prioritizes causally relevant features near the central pixel, leveraging the localized nature of pixel-wise classification tasks. Additionally, the lightweight Cross Mamba module is proposed to facilitates complementary multi-scale feature interaction with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate ECP-Mamba's effectiveness in balancing high accuracy with resource efficiency. On the Flevoland 1989 dataset, ECP-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall accuracy of 99.70%, average accuracy of 99.64% and Kappa coefficient of 99.62e-2.

  _Shijun Shi, Jing Xu, Lijing Lu, Zhihang Li, Kai Hu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods are susceptible to introducing complex degradations and noticeable artifacts into high-resolution videos due to their inherent randomness. In this paper, we propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization in vision-language tasks, yet their ability to understand and act within embodied environments remains underexplored. We present NavBench, a benchmark to evaluate the embodied navigation capabilities of MLLMs under zero-shot settings. NavBench consists of two components: (1) navigation comprehension, assessed through three cognitively grounded tasks including global instruction alignment, temporal progress estimation, and local observation-action reasoning, covering 3,200 question-answer pairs; and (2) step-by-step execution in 432 episodes across 72 indoor scenes, stratified by spatial, cognitive, and execution complexity. To support real-world deployment, we introduce a pipeline that converts MLLMs' outputs into robotic actions. We evaluate both proprietary and open-source models, finding that GPT-4o performs well across tasks, while lighter open-source models succeed in simpler cases. Results also show that models with higher comprehension scores tend to achieve better execution performance. Providing map-based context improves decision accuracy, especially in medium-difficulty scenarios. However, most models struggle with temporal understanding, particularly in estimating progress during navigation, which may pose a key challenge.

  Multimodal MR-US registration is critical for prostate cancer diagnosis. However, this task remains challenging due to significant modality discrepancies. Existing methods often fail to align critical boundaries while being overly sensitive to irrelevant details. To address this, we propose an anatomically coherent modality translation (ACMT) network based on a hierarchical feature disentanglement design. We leverage shallow-layer features for texture consistency and deep-layer features for boundary preservation. Unlike conventional modality translation methods that convert one modality into another, our ACMT introduces the customized design of an intermediate pseudo modality. Both MR and US images are translated toward this intermediate domain, effectively addressing the bottlenecks faced by traditional translation methods in the downstream registration task. Experiments demonstrate that our method mitigates modality-specific discrepancies while preserving crucial anatomical boundaries for accurate registration. Quantitative evaluations show superior modality similarity compared to state-of-the-art modality translation methods. Furthermore, downstream registration experiments confirm that our translated images achieve the best alignment performance, highlighting the robustness of our framework for multi-modal prostate image registration.

  Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) exhibits strong generalisation for promptable segmentation in video clips; however, its integration with the audio modality remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly follow two directions: (1) injecting adapters into the image encoder to receive audio signals, which incurs efficiency costs during prompt engineering, and (2) leveraging additional foundation models to generate visual prompts for the sounding objects, which are often imprecisely localised, leading to misguidance in SAM2. Moreover, these methods overlook the rich semantic interplay between hierarchical visual features and other modalities, resulting in suboptimal cross-modal fusion. In this work, we propose AuralSAM2, comprising the novel AuralFuser module, which externally attaches to SAM2 to integrate features from different modalities and generate feature-level prompts, guiding SAM2's decoder in segmenting sounding targets. Such integration is facilitated by a feature pyramid, further refining semantic understanding and enhancing object awareness in multimodal scenarios. Additionally, the audio-guided contrastive learning is introduced to explicitly align audio and visual representations and to also mitigate biases caused by dominant visual patterns. Results on public benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the previous methods in the field. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MoCA-Video (Motion-Aware Concept Alignment in Video), a training-free framework bridging the gap between image-domain semantic mixing and video. Given a generated video and a user-provided reference image, MoCA-Video injects the semantic features of the reference image into a specific object within the video, while preserving the original motion and visual context. Our approach leverages a diagonal denoising schedule and class-agnostic segmentation to detect and track objects in the latent space and precisely control the spatial location of the blended objects. To ensure temporal coherence, we incorporate momentum-based semantic corrections and gamma residual noise stabilization for smooth frame transitions. We evaluate MoCA's performance using the standard SSIM, image-level LPIPS, temporal LPIPS, and introduce a novel metric CASS (Conceptual Alignment Shift Score) to evaluate the consistency and effectiveness of the visual shifts between the source prompt and the modified video frames. Using self-constructed dataset, MoCA-Video outperforms current baselines, achieving superior spatial consistency, coherent motion, and a significantly higher CASS score, despite having no training or fine-tuning. MoCA-Video demonstrates that structured manipulation in the diffusion noise trajectory allows for controllable, high-quality video synthesis.

  Benchmark object detection (OD) datasets play a pivotal role in advancing computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, and surveillance, as well as in training and evaluating deep learning-based state-of-the-art detection models. Among them, MS-COCO has become a standard benchmark due to its diverse object categories and complex scenes. However, despite its wide adoption, MS-COCO suffers from various annotation issues, including missing labels, incorrect class assignments, inaccurate bounding boxes, duplicate labels, and group labeling inconsistencies. These errors not only hinder model training but also degrade the reliability and generalization of OD models. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive refinement framework and present MJ-COCO, a newly re-annotated version of MS-COCO. Our approach begins with loss and gradient-based error detection to identify potentially mislabeled or hard-to-learn samples. Next, we apply a four-stage pseudo-labeling refinement process: (1) bounding box generation using invertible transformations, (2) IoU-based duplicate removal and confidence merging, (3) class consistency verification via expert objects recognizer, and (4) spatial adjustment based on object region activation map analysis. This integrated pipeline enables scalable and accurate correction of annotation errors without manual re-labeling. Extensive experiments were conducted across four validation datasets: MS-COCO, Sama COCO, Objects365, and PASCAL VOC. Models trained on MJ-COCO consistently outperformed those trained on MS-COCO, achieving improvements in Average Precision (AP) and APS metrics. MJ-COCO also demonstrated significant gains in annotation coverage: for example, the number of small object annotations increased by more than 200,000 compared to MS-COCO.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, but controllable generation remains challenging, particularly under limited data and compute. Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications, which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong performance with as few as 10-30 training samples. We validate our method across a range of tasks, including image-to-video and video-to-video generation, using large-scale base models such as CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B. Extensive experiments show that TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both condition fidelity and visual quality, while remaining highly efficient in both training and inference.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-form video understanding poses a significant challenge for video large language models (VideoLLMs) due to prohibitively high computational and memory demands. In this paper, we propose FlexSelect, a flexible and efficient token selection strategy for processing long videos. FlexSelect identifies and retains the most semantically relevant content by leveraging cross-modal attention patterns from a reference transformer layer. It comprises two key components: (1) a training-free token ranking pipeline that leverages faithful cross-modal attention weights to estimate each video token's importance, and (2) a rank-supervised lightweight selector that is trained to replicate these rankings and filter redundant tokens. This generic approach can be seamlessly integrated into various VideoLLM architectures, such as LLaVA-Video, InternVL and Qwen-VL, serving as a plug-and-play module to extend their temporal context length. Empirically, FlexSelect delivers strong gains across multiple long-video benchmarks including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVB, and LVBench. Moreover, it achieves significant speed-ups (for example, up to 9 times on a LLaVA-Video-7B model), highlighting FlexSelect's promise for efficient long-form video understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of ResNet provides a powerful tool for training extremely deep networks. The core idea behind it is to change the learning goals of the network. It no longer learns new features from scratch but learns the difference between the target and existing features. However, the difference between the two kinds of features does not have an independent and clear meaning, and the amount of learning is based on the absolute rather than the relative difference, which is sensitive to the size of existing features. We propose a new network that perfectly solves these two problems while still having the advantages of ResNet. Specifically, it chooses to learn the quotient of the target features with the existing features, so we call it the quotient network. In order to enable this network to learn successfully and achieve higher performance, we propose some design rules for this network so that it can be trained efficiently and achieve better performance than ResNet. Experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets prove that this network can stably achieve considerable improvements over ResNet by simply making tiny corresponding changes to the original ResNet network without adding new parameters.

  The rapid evolution of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) is driving significant advancements in visual understanding and generation. Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities, concerning the fine-grained physical principles especially in geometric optics, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GOBench, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability across two tasks: 1) Generating Optically Authentic Imagery and 2) Understanding Underlying Optical Phenomena. We curates high-quality prompts of geometric optical scenarios and use MLLMs to construct GOBench-Gen-1kthis http URLthen organize subjective experiments to assess the generated imagery based on Optical Authenticity, Aesthetic Quality, and Instruction Fidelity, revealing MLLMs' generation flaws that violate optical principles. For the understanding task, we apply crafted evaluation instructions to test optical understanding ability of eleven prominent MLLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that current models face significant challenges in both optical generation and understanding. The top-performing generative model, GPT-4o-Image, cannot perfectly complete all generation tasks, and the best-performing MLLM model, Gemini-2.5Pro, attains a mere 37.35\% accuracy in optical understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in visual domains has resulted in highly realistic synthetic images and videos, driven by sophisticated generative frameworks such as diffusion-based architectures. While these breakthroughs open substantial opportunities, they simultaneously raise critical concerns about content authenticity and integrity. Many current AIGC detection methods operate as black-box binary classifiers, which offer limited interpretability, and no approach supports detecting both images and videos in a unified framework. This dual limitation compromises model transparency, reduces trustworthiness, and hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce IVY-FAKE , a novel, unified, and large-scale dataset specifically designed for explainable multimodal AIGC detection. Unlike prior benchmarks, which suffer from fragmented modality coverage and sparse annotations, IVY-FAKE contains over 150,000 richly annotated training samples (images and videos) and 18,700 evaluation examples, each accompanied by detailed natural-language reasoning beyond simple binary labels. Building on this, we propose Ivy Explainable Detector (IVY-XDETECTOR), a unified AIGC detection and explainable architecture that jointly performs explainable detection for both image and video content. Our unified vision-language model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple image and video detection benchmarks, highlighting the significant advancements enabled by our dataset and modeling framework.

  In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for continual learning in anomaly detection, aimed at better reflecting real-world deployment scenarios. Our benchmark, Continual-MEGA, includes a large and diverse dataset that significantly expands existing evaluation settings by combining carefully curated existing datasets with our newly proposed dataset, ContinualAD. In addition to standard continual learning with expanded quantity, we propose a novel scenario that measures zero-shot generalization to unseen classes, those not observed during continual adaptation. This setting poses a new problem setting that continual adaptation also enhances zero-shot performance. We also present a unified baseline algorithm that improves robustness in few-shot detection and maintains strong generalization. Through extensive evaluations, we report three key findings: (1) existing methods show substantial room for improvement, particularly in pixel-level defect localization; (2) our proposed method consistently outperforms prior approaches; and (3) the newly introduced ContinualAD dataset enhances the performance of strong anomaly detection models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-defined 3D object templates are widely used in 3D reconstruction of hand-object interactions. However, they often require substantial manual efforts to capture or source, and inherently restrict the adaptability of models to unconstrained interaction scenarios, e.g., heavily-occluded objects. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a new Text-Instructed Generation and Refinement (TIGeR) framework, harnessing the power of intuitive text-driven priors to steer the object shape refinement and pose estimation. We use a two-stage framework: a text-instructed prior generation and vision-guided refinement. As the name implies, we first leverage off-the-shelf models to generate shape priors according to the text description without tedious 3D crafting. Considering the geometric gap between the synthesized prototype and the real object interacted with the hand, we further calibrate the synthesized prototype via 2D-3D collaborative attention. TIGeR achieves competitive performance, i.e., 1.979 and 5.468 object Chamfer distance on the widely-used Dex-YCB and Obman datasets, respectively, surpassing existing template-free methods. Notably, the proposed framework shows robustness to occlusion, while maintaining compatibility with heterogeneous prior sources, e.g., retrieved hand-crafted prototypes, in practical deployment scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human perception of events is intrinsically tied to distinguishing between completed (perfect and telic) and ongoing (durative) actions, a process mediated by both linguistic structure and visual cues. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Perfect Times} dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English, Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.

  With the inherent advantages of skeleton representation, 3D skeleton-based action recognition has become a prominent topic in the field of computer vision. However, previous reviews have predominantly adopted a model-oriented perspective, often neglecting the fundamental steps involved in skeleton-based action recognition. This oversight tends to ignore key components of skeleton-based action recognition beyond model design and has hindered deeper, more intrinsic understanding of the task. To bridge this gap, our review aims to address these limitations by presenting a comprehensive, task-oriented framework for understanding skeleton-based action recognition. We begin by decomposing the task into a series of sub-tasks, placing particular emphasis on preprocessing steps such as modality derivation and data augmentation. The subsequent discussion delves into critical sub-tasks, including feature extraction and spatio-temporal modeling techniques. Beyond foundational action recognition networks, recently advanced frameworks such as hybrid architectures, Mamba models, large language models (LLMs), and generative models have also been highlighted. Finally, a comprehensive overview of public 3D skeleton datasets is presented, accompanied by an analysis of state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on these benchmarks. By integrating task-oriented discussions, comprehensive examinations of sub-tasks, and an emphasis on the latest advancements, our review provides a fundamental and accessible structured roadmap for understanding and advancing the field of 3D skeleton-based action recognition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent progress, most existing virtual try-on methods still struggle to simultaneously address two core challenges: accurately aligning the garment image with the target human body, and preserving fine-grained garment textures and patterns. In this paper, we propose DS-VTON, a dual-scale virtual try-on framework that explicitly disentangles these objectives for more effective modeling. DS-VTON consists of two stages: the first stage generates a low-resolution try-on result to capture the semantic correspondence between garment and body, where reduced detail facilitates robust structural alignment. The second stage introduces a residual-guided diffusion process that reconstructs high-resolution outputs by refining the residual between the two scales, focusing on texture fidelity. In addition, our method adopts a fully mask-free generation paradigm, eliminating reliance on human parsing maps or segmentation masks. By leveraging the semantic priors embedded in pretrained diffusion models, this design more effectively preserves the person's appearance and geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DS-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance in both structural alignment and texture preservation across multiple standard virtual try-on benchmarks.

  The construction industry faces significant challenges in optimizing equipment utilization, as underused machinery leads to increased operational costs and project delays. Accurate and timely monitoring of equipment activity is therefore key to identifying idle periods and improving overall efficiency. This paper presents the Edge-IMI framework for detecting idle construction machinery, specifically designed for integration with surveillance camera systems. The proposed solution consists of three components: object detection, tracking, and idle state identification, which are tailored for execution on resource-constrained, CPU-based edge computing devices. The performance of Edge-IMI is evaluated using a combined dataset derived from the ACID and MOCS benchmarks. Experimental results confirm that the object detector achieves an F1 score of 71.75%, indicating robust real-world detection capabilities. The logistic regression-based idle identification module reliably distinguishes between active and idle machinery with minimal false positives. Integrating all three modules, Edge-IMI enables efficient on-site inference, reducing reliance on high-bandwidth cloud services and costly hardware accelerators. We also evaluate the performance of object detection models on Raspberry Pi 5 and an Intel NUC platforms, as example edge computing platforms. We assess the feasibility of real-time processing and the impact of model optimization techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify human emotions by combining data from various modalities such as language, audio, and vision. Despite the recent advances of MER approaches, the limitations in obtaining extensive datasets impede the improvement of performance. To mitigate this issue, we leverage a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based architecture and its semantic knowledge from massive datasets that aims to enhance the discriminative multimodal representation. We propose a label encoder-guided MER framework based on CLIP (MER-CLIP) to learn emotion-related representations across modalities. Our approach introduces a label encoder that treats labels as text embeddings to incorporate their semantic information, leading to the learning of more representative emotional features. To further exploit label semantics, we devise a cross-modal decoder that aligns each modality to a shared embedding space by sequentially fusing modality features based on emotion-related input from the label encoder. Finally, the label encoder-guided prediction enables generalization across diverse labels by embedding their semantic information as well as word labels. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on the benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments, wherein event modeling is crucial for partitioning the video into smaller temporal events that partially correspond to the text. Previous methods typically segment videos into a fixed number of equal-length clips, resulting in ambiguous event boundaries. Additionally, they rely on mean pooling to compute event representations, inevitably introducing undesired misalignment. To address these, we propose an Uneven Event Modeling (UEM) framework for PRVR. We first introduce the Progressive-Grouped Video Segmentation (PGVS) module, to iteratively formulate events in light of both temporal dependencies and semantic similarity between consecutive frames, enabling clear event boundaries. Furthermore, we also propose the Context-Aware Event Refinement (CAER) module to refine the event representation conditioned the text's cross-attention. This enables event representations to focus on the most relevant frames for a given text, facilitating more precise text-video alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two PRVR benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current AIGC detectors often achieve near-perfect accuracy on images produced by the same generator used for training but struggle to generalize to outputs from unseen generators. We trace this failure in part to latent prior bias: detectors learn shortcuts tied to patterns stemming from the initial noise vector rather than learning robust generative artifacts. To address this, we propose On-Manifold Adversarial Training (OMAT): by optimizing the initial latent noise of diffusion models under fixed conditioning, we generate on-manifold adversarial examples that remain on the generator's output manifold-unlike pixel-space attacks, which introduce off-manifold perturbations that the generator itself cannot reproduce and that can obscure the true discriminative artifacts. To test against state-of-the-art generative models, we introduce GenImage++, a test-only benchmark of outputs from advanced generators (Flux.1, SD3) with extended prompts and diverse styles. We apply our adversarial-training paradigm to ResNet50 and CLIP baselines and evaluate across existing AIGC forensic benchmarks and recent challenge datasets. Extensive experiments show that adversarially trained detectors significantly improve cross-generator performance without any network redesign. Our findings on latent-prior bias offer valuable insights for future dataset construction and detector evaluation, guiding the development of more robust and generalizable AIGC forensic methodologies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released atthis https URL.

  The synchrotron light source, a cutting-edge large-scale user facility, requires autonomous synchrotron beamline operations, a crucial technique that should enable experiments to be conducted automatically, reliably, and safely with minimum human intervention. However, current state-of-the-art synchrotron beamlines still heavily rely on human safety oversight. To bridge the gap between automated and autonomous operation, a computer vision-based system is proposed, integrating deep learning and multiview cameras for real-time collision detection. The system utilizes equipment segmentation, tracking, and geometric analysis to assess potential collisions with transfer learning that enhances robustness. In addition, an interactive annotation module has been developed to improve the adaptability to new object classes. Experiments on a real beamline dataset demonstrate high accuracy, real-time performance, and strong potential for autonomous synchrotron beamline operations.

In this paper, we present SkyReels-Audio, a unified framework for synthesizing high-fidelity and temporally coherent talking portrait videos. Built upon pretrained video diffusion transformers, our framework supports infinite-length generation and editing, while enabling diverse and controllable conditioning through multimodal inputs. We employ a hybrid curriculum learning strategy to progressively align audio with facial motion, enabling fine-grained multimodal control over long video sequences. To enhance local facial coherence, we introduce a facial mask loss and an audio-guided classifier-free guidance mechanism. A sliding-window denoising approach further fuses latent representations across temporal segments, ensuring visual fidelity and temporal consistency across extended durations and diverse identities. More importantly, we construct a dedicated data pipeline for curating high-quality triplets consisting of synchronized audio, video, and textual descriptions. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations show that SkyReels-Audio achieves superior performance in lip-sync accuracy, identity consistency, and realistic facial dynamics, particularly under complex and challenging conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we address the challenge of understanding human activities from an egocentric perspective. Traditional activity recognition techniques face unique challenges in egocentric videos due to the highly dynamic nature of the head during many activities. We propose a framework that seeks to address these challenges in a way that is independent of network architecture by restricting the ego-video input to a stabilized, hand-focused video. We demonstrate that this straightforward video transformation alone outperforms existing egocentric video baselines on the Ego-Exo4D Fine-Grained Keystep Recognition benchmark without requiring any alteration of the underlying model infrastructure.

  Diffusion models have been achieving remarkable performance in face restoration. However, the heavy computations of diffusion models make it difficult to deploy them on devices like smartphones. In this work, we propose QuantFace, a novel low-bit quantization for one-step diffusion face restoration models, where the full-precision (\ie, 32-bit) weights and activations are quantized to 4$\sim$6-bit. We first analyze the data distribution within activations and find that they are highly variant. To preserve the original data information, we employ rotation-scaling channel balancing. Furthermore, we propose Quantization-Distillation Low-Rank Adaptation (QD-LoRA) that jointly optimizes for quantization and distillation performance. Finally, we propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy. We formulate such a strategy as an integer programming problem, which combines quantization error and perceptual metrics to find a satisfactory resource allocation. Extensive experiments on the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of QuantFace under 6-bit and 4-bit. QuantFace achieves significant advantages over recent leading low-bit quantization methods for face restoration. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Multi-label CIL (MLCIL) extends CIL to a real-world scenario where each sample may belong to multiple classes, introducing several challenges: label absence, which leads to incomplete historical information due to missing labels, and class imbalance, which results in the model bias toward majority classes. To address these challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance. Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms existing methods in MLCIL tasks. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tabular-image multimodal learning, which integrates structured tabular data with imaging data, holds great promise for a variety of tasks, especially in medical applications. Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs, underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have achieved success across various tasks, yet most existing methods overlook the modality misalignment issue that can lead to untrustworthy responses in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1) Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following, demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000 training entries.

  Medical professionals, especially those in training, often depend on visual reference materials to support an accurate diagnosis and develop pattern recognition skills. However, existing resources may lack the diversity and accessibility needed for broad and effective clinical learning. This paper presents a system designed to generate realistic medical images from textual descriptions and validate their accuracy through a classification model. A pretrained stable diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the PathMNIST dataset, consisting of nine colorectal histopathology tissue types. The generative model was trained multiple times using different training parameter configurations, guided by domain-specific prompts to capture meaningful features. To ensure quality control, a ResNet-18 classification model was trained on the same dataset, achieving 99.76% accuracy in detecting the correct label of a colorectal histopathological medical image. Generated images were then filtered using the trained classifier and an iterative process, where inaccurate outputs were discarded and regenerated until they were correctly classified. The highest performing version of the generative model from experimentation achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with precision and recall scores of 0.6817 and 0.7111, respectively. Some types of tissue, such as adipose tissue and lymphocytes, reached perfect classification scores, while others proved more challenging due to structural complexity. The self-validating approach created demonstrates a reliable method for synthesizing domain-specific medical images because of high accuracy in both the generation and classification portions of the system, with potential applications in both diagnostic support and clinical education. Future work includes improving prompt-specific accuracy and extending the system to other areas of medical imaging.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current motion-based multiple object tracking (MOT) approaches rely heavily on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for object association. Without using 3D features, they are ineffective in scenarios with occlusions or visually similar objects. To address this, our paper presents a novel depth-aware framework for MOT. We estimate depth using a zero-shot approach and incorporate it as an independent feature in the association process. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Alignment Score that refines IoU by integrating both coarse bounding box overlap and fine-grained (pixel-level) alignment to improve association accuracy without requiring additional learnable parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first MOT framework to incorporate 3D features (monocular depth) as an independent decision matrix in the association step. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks without any training nor fine-tuning. The code is available atthis https URL

  Video processing for real-time analytics in resource-constrained environments presents a significant challenge in balancing energy consumption and video semantics. This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient video processing by proposing a system that dynamically optimizes processing configurations to minimize energy usage on the edge, while preserving essential video features for deep learning inference. We first gather an extensive offline profile of various configurations consisting of device CPU frequencies, frame filtering features, difference thresholds, and video bitrates, to establish apriori knowledge of their impact on energy consumption and inference accuracy. Leveraging this insight, we introduce an online system that employs multi-objective Bayesian optimization to intelligently explore and adapt configurations in real time. Our approach continuously refines processing settings to meet a target inference accuracy with minimal edge device energy expenditure. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in reducing video processing energy use while maintaining high analytical performance, offering a practical solution for smart devices and edge computing applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Designing 3D scenes is traditionally a challenging task that demands both artistic expertise and proficiency with complex software. Recent advances in text-to-3D generation have greatly simplified this process by letting users create scenes based on simple text descriptions. However, as these methods generally require extra training or in-context learning, their performance is often hindered by the limited availability of high-quality 3D data. In contrast, modern text-to-image models learned from web-scale images can generate scenes with diverse, reliable spatial layouts and consistent, visually appealing styles. Our key insight is that instead of learning directly from 3D scenes, we can leverage generated 2D images as an intermediary to guide 3D synthesis. In light of this, we introduce ArtiScene, a training-free automated pipeline for scene design that integrates the flexibility of free-form text-to-image generation with the diversity and reliability of 2D intermediary layouts.First, we generate 2D images from a scene description, then extract the shape and appearance of objects to create 3D models. These models are assembled into the final scene using geometry, position, and pose information derived from the same intermediary image. Being generalizable to a wide range of scenes and styles, ArtiScene outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin in layout and aesthetic quality by quantitative metrics. It also averages a 74.89% winning rate in extensive user studies and 95.07% in GPT-4o evaluation. Project page:this https URL

  Agriculture is vital for global food security, but crops are vulnerable to diseases that impact yield and quality. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) accurately classify plant diseases using leaf images, their high computational demands hinder their deployment in resource-constrained settings such as smartphones, edge devices, and real-time monitoring systems. This study proposes a two-step model compression approach integrating Weight Pruning and Knowledge Distillation, along with the hybridization of DenseNet with Involutional Layers. Pruning reduces model size and computational load, while distillation improves the smaller student models performance by transferring knowledge from a larger teacher network. The hybridization enhances the models ability to capture spatial features efficiently. These compressed models are suitable for real-time applications, promoting precision agriculture through rapid disease identification and crop management. The results demonstrate ResNet50s superior performance post-compression, achieving 99.55% and 98.99% accuracy on the PlantVillage and PaddyLeaf datasets, respectively. The DenseNet-based model, optimized for efficiency, recorded 99.21% and 93.96% accuracy with a minimal parameter count. Furthermore, the hybrid model achieved 98.87% and 97.10% accuracy, supporting the practical deployment of energy-efficient devices for timely disease intervention and sustainable farming practices.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Common Inpainted Objects In-N-Out of Context (COinCO), a novel dataset addressing the scarcity of out-of-context examples in existing vision datasets. By systematically replacing objects in COCO images through diffusion-based inpainting, we create 97,722 unique images featuring both contextually coherent and inconsistent scenes, enabling effective context learning. Each inpainted object is meticulously verified and categorized as in- or out-of-context through a multimodal large language model assessment. Our analysis reveals significant patterns in semantic priors that influence inpainting success across object categories. We demonstrate three key tasks enabled by COinCO: (1) training context classifiers that effectively determine whether existing objects belong in their context; (2) a novel Objects-from-Context prediction task that determines which new objects naturally belong in given scenes at both instance and clique levels, and (3) context-enhanced fake detection on state-of-the-art methods without fine-tuning. COinCO provides a controlled testbed with contextual variations, establishing a foundation for advancing context-aware visual understanding in computer vision and image forensics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human vision organizes local cues into coherent global forms using Gestalt principles like closure, proximity, and figure-ground assignment -- functions reliant on global spatial structure. We investigate whether modern vision models show similar behaviors, and under what training conditions these emerge. We find that Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained with Masked Autoencoding (MAE) exhibit activation patterns consistent with Gestalt laws, including illusory contour completion, convexity preference, and dynamic figure-ground segregation. To probe the computational basis, we hypothesize that modeling global dependencies is necessary for Gestalt-like organization. We introduce the Distorted Spatial Relationship Testbench (DiSRT), which evaluates sensitivity to global spatial perturbations while preserving local textures. Using DiSRT, we show that self-supervised models (e.g., MAE, CLIP) outperform supervised baselines and sometimes even exceed human performance. ConvNeXt models trained with MAE also exhibit Gestalt-compatible representations, suggesting such sensitivity can arise without attention architectures. However, classification finetuning degrades this ability. Inspired by biological vision, we show that a Top-K activation sparsity mechanism can restore global sensitivity. Our findings identify training conditions that promote or suppress Gestalt-like perception and establish DiSRT as a diagnostic for global structure sensitivity across models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The desire for cameras with smaller form factors has recently lead to a push for exploring computational imaging systems with reduced optical complexity such as a smaller number of lens elements. Unfortunately such simplified optical systems usually suffer from severe aberrations, especially in off-axis regions, which can be difficult to correct purely in software.In this paper we introduce Fovea Stacking, a new type of imaging system that utilizes emerging dynamic optical components called deformable phase plates (DPPs) for localized aberration correction anywhere on the image sensor. By optimizing DPP deformations through a differentiable optical model, off-axis aberrations are corrected locally, producing a foveated image with enhanced sharpness at the fixation point - analogous to the eye's fovea. Stacking multiple such foveated images, each with a different fixation point, yields a composite image free from aberrations. To efficiently cover the entire field of view, we propose joint optimization of DPP deformations under imaging budget constraints. Due to the DPP device's non-linear behavior, we introduce a neural network-based control model for improved alignment between simulation-hardware performance.We further demonstrated that for extended depth-of-field imaging, fovea stacking outperforms traditional focus stacking in image quality. By integrating object detection or eye-tracking, the system can dynamically adjust the lens to track the object of interest-enabling real-time foveated video suitable for downstream applications such as surveillance or foveated virtual reality displays.

  Vector-Quantized Generative Models (VQGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for image generation. However, the key component of VQGMs -- the codebook of discrete tokens -- is still not well understood, e.g., which tokens are critical to generate an image of a certain concept? This paper introduces Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX), a novel approach for interpreting VQGMs by identifying concept-specific token combinations. Our framework employs two methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token importance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation method that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens. Experimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear explanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines across multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX is useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature detection.

  Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a key investigation in clinical cardiovascular medicine and has been used extensively in population research. However, extracting clinically important measurements such as ejection fraction for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases remains time-consuming and subjective. We developed CineMA, a foundation AI model automating these tasks with limited labels. CineMA is a self-supervised autoencoder model trained on 74,916 cine CMR studies to reconstruct images from masked inputs. After fine-tuning, it was evaluated across eight datasets on 23 tasks from four categories: ventricle and myocardium segmentation, left and right ventricle ejection fraction calculation, disease detection and classification, and landmark localisation. CineMA is the first foundation model for cine CMR to match or outperform convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CineMA demonstrated greater label efficiency than CNNs, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer annotations. This reduces the burden of clinician labelling and supports replacing task-specific training with fine-tuning foundation models in future cardiac imaging applications. Models and code for pre-training and fine-tuning are available atthis https URL, democratising access to high-performance models that otherwise require substantial computational resources, promoting reproducibility and accelerating clinical translation.

  Image classifiers, such as those used for autonomous vehicle navigation, are largely known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks that target the input image set. There is extensive discussion on adversarial attacks including perturbations that alter the input images to cause malicious misclassifications without perceivable modification.

  Objective: While recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have enabled the synthesis of realistic medical images, progress has been largely confined to 2D modalities such as chest X-rays. Extending text-to-image generation to volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) remains a significant challenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the absence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical imaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation that combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language pretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model trained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared embedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT volumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained volumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring external super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the CT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity, clinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for text-to-CT generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CT scans synthesized by our framework can effectively augment real data, improving downstream diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Our results show that modality-specific vision-language alignment is a key component for high-quality 3D medical image generation. By integrating contrastive pretraining and volumetric diffusion, our method offers a scalable and controllable solution for synthesizing clinically meaningful CT volumes from text, paving the way for new applications in data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The imbalanced distribution of long-tailed data presents a significant challenge for deep learning models, causing them to prioritize head classes while neglecting tail classes. Two key factors contributing to low recognition accuracy are the deformed representation space and a biased classifier, stemming from insufficient semantic information in tail classes. To address these issues, we propose permutation-invariant and head-to-tail feature fusion (PI-H2T), a highly adaptable method. PI-H2T enhances the representation space through permutation-invariant representation fusion (PIF), yielding more clustered features and automatic class margins. Additionally, it adjusts the biased classifier by transferring semantic information from head to tail classes via head-to-tail fusion (H2TF), improving tail class diversity. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that PI-H2T optimizes both the representation space and decision boundaries. Its plug-and-play design ensures seamless integration into existing methods, providing a straightforward path to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of PI-H2T.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalizing diffusion models to specific users or concepts remains challenging, particularly when only a few reference images are available. Existing methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion often overfit to limited data, causing misalignment between generated images and text prompts when attempting to balance identity fidelity with prompt adherence. While Direct Consistency Optimization (DCO) with its consistency-guided sampling partially alleviates this issue, it still struggles with complex or stylized prompts. In this paper, we propose a parallel rescaling technique for personalized diffusion models. Our approach explicitly decomposes the consistency guidance signal into parallel and orthogonal components relative to classifier free guidance (CFG). By rescaling the parallel component, we minimize disruptive interference with CFG while preserving the subject's identity. Unlike prior personalization methods, our technique does not require additional training data or expensive annotations. Extensive experiments show improved prompt alignment and visual fidelity compared to baseline methods, even on challenging stylized prompts. These findings highlight the potential of parallel rescaled guidance to yield more stable and accurate personalization for diverse user inputs.

  With the advancement of modern medicine and the development of technologies such as MRI, CT, and cellular analysis, it has become increasingly critical for clinicians to accurately interpret various diagnostic images. However, modern medical education often faces challenges due to limited access to high-quality teaching materials, stemming from privacy concerns and a shortage of educational resources (Balogh et al., 2015). In this context, image data generated by machine learning models, particularly generative models, presents a promising solution. These models can create diverse and comparable imaging datasets without compromising patient privacy, thereby supporting modern medical education.

  Generating continuous ground-level video from satellite imagery is a challenging task with significant potential for applications in simulation, autonomous navigation, and digital twin cities. Existing approaches primarily focus on synthesizing individual ground-view images, often relying on auxiliary inputs like height maps or handcrafted projections, and fall short in producing temporally consistent sequences. In this paper, we propose {SatDreamer360}, a novel framework that generates geometrically and temporally consistent ground-view video from a single satellite image and a predefined trajectory. To bridge the large viewpoint gap, we introduce a compact tri-plane representation that encodes scene geometry directly from the satellite image. A ray-based pixel attention mechanism retrieves view-dependent features from the tri-plane, enabling accurate cross-view correspondence without requiring additional geometric priors. To ensure multi-frame consistency, we propose an epipolar-constrained temporal attention module that aligns features across frames using the known relative poses along the trajectory. To support evaluation, we introduce {VIGOR++}, a large-scale dataset for cross-view video generation, with dense trajectory annotations and high-quality ground-view sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SatDreamer360 achieves superior performance in fidelity, coherence, and geometric alignment across diverse urban scenes.

  We introduce XYZ-IBD, a bin-picking dataset for 6D pose estimation that captures real-world industrial complexity, including challenging object geometries, reflective materials, severe occlusions, and dense clutter. The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less, metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more realistic and challenging problems for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent advances in diffusion models, top-tier text-to-image (T2I) models still struggle to achieve precise spatial layout control, i.e. accurately generating entities with specified attributes and locations. Segmentation-mask-to-image (S2I) generation has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating pixel-level spatial guidance and regional text prompts. However, existing S2I methods fail to simultaneously ensure semantic consistency and shape consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Seg2Any, a novel S2I framework built upon advanced multimodal diffusion transformers (e.g. FLUX). First, to achieve both semantic and shape consistency, we decouple segmentation mask conditions into regional semantic and high-frequency shape components. The regional semantic condition is introduced by a Semantic Alignment Attention Mask, ensuring that generated entities adhere to their assigned text prompts. The high-frequency shape condition, representing entity boundaries, is encoded as an Entity Contour Map and then introduced as an additional modality via multi-modal attention to guide image spatial structure. Second, to prevent attribute leakage across entities in multi-entity scenarios, we introduce an Attribute Isolation Attention Mask mechanism, which constrains each entity's image tokens to attend exclusively to themselves during image self-attention. To support open-set S2I generation, we construct SACap-1M, a large-scale dataset containing 1 million images with 5.9 million segmented entities and detailed regional captions, along with a SACap-Eval benchmark for comprehensive S2I evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Seg2Any achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-set and closed-set S2I benchmarks, particularly in fine-grained spatial and attribute control of entities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The diagnosis of prostate cancer increasingly depends on multimodal imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, accurate registration between these modalities remains a fundamental challenge due to the differences in dimensionality and anatomical representations. In this work, we present a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage process: TRUS 3D reconstruction followed by cross-modal registration. Unlike existing TRUS 3D reconstruction methods that rely heavily on external probe tracking information, we propose a totally probe-location-independent approach that leverages the natural correlation between sagittal and transverse TRUS views. With the help of our clustering-based feature matching method, we enable the spatial localization of 2D frames without any additional probe tracking information. For the registration stage, we introduce an unsupervised diffusion-based framework guided by modality translation. Unlike existing methods that translate one modality into another, we map both MR and US into a pseudo intermediate modality. This design enables us to customize it to retain only registration-critical features, greatly easing registration. To further enhance anatomical alignment, we incorporate an anatomy-aware registration strategy that prioritizes internal structural coherence while adaptively reducing the influence of boundary inconsistencies. Extensive validation demonstrates that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior registration accuracy with physically realistic deformations in a completely unsupervised fashion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The characterization of mechanical properties for high-dynamic, high-velocity target motion is essential in industries. It provides crucial data for validating weapon systems and precision manufacturing processes etc. However, existing measurement methods face challenges such as limited dynamic range, discontinuous observations, and high costs. This paper presents a new approach leveraging an event-based multi-view photogrammetric system, which aims to address the aforementioned challenges. First, the monotonicity in the spatiotemporal distribution of events is leveraged to extract the target's leading-edge features, eliminating the tailing effect that complicates motion measurements. Then, reprojection error is used to associate events with the target's trajectory, providing more data than traditional intersection methods. Finally, a target velocity decay model is employed to fit the data, enabling accurate motion measurements via ours multi-view data joint computation. In a light gas gun fragment test, the proposed method showed a measurement deviation of 4.47% compared to the electromagnetic speedometer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing. Orthographic projection reasoning underpins the entire CAD workflow, encompassing design, manufacturing, and simulation. However, prevailing deep-learning approaches employ standard 3D reconstruction pipelines as an alternative, which often introduce imprecise dimensions and limit the parametric editability required for CAD workflows. Recently, some researchers adopt vision-language models (VLMs), particularly supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to tackle CAD-related challenges. SFT shows promise but often devolves into pattern memorization, yielding poor out-of-distribution performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce CReFT-CAD, a two-stage fine-tuning paradigm that first employs a curriculum-driven reinforcement learning stage with difficulty-aware rewards to build reasoning ability steadily, and then applies supervised post-tuning to hone instruction following and semantic extraction. Complementing this, we release TriView2CAD, the first large-scale, open-source benchmark for orthographic projection reasoning, comprising 200,000 synthetic and 3,000 real-world orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations and six interoperable data modalities. We benchmark leading VLMs on orthographic projection reasoning and demonstrate that CReFT-CAD substantially improves reasoning accuracy and out-of-distribution generalizability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights for advancing CAD reasoning research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As research on neural volumetric video reconstruction and compression flourishes, there is a need for diverse and realistic datasets, which can be used to develop and validate reconstruction and compression models. However, existing volumetric video datasets lack diverse content in terms of both semantic and low-level features that are commonly present in real-world production pipelines. In this context, we propose a new dataset, ViVo, for VolumetrIc VideO reconstruction and compression. The dataset is faithful to real-world volumetric video production and is the first dataset to extend the definition of diversity to include both human-centric characteristics (skin, hair, etc.) and dynamic visual phenomena (transparent, reflective, liquid, etc.). Each video sequence in this database contains raw data including fourteen multi-view RGB and depth video pairs, synchronized at 30FPS with per-frame calibration and audio data, and their associated 2-D foreground masks and 3-D point clouds. To demonstrate the use of this database, we have benchmarked three state-of-the-art (SotA) 3-D reconstruction methods and two volumetric video compression algorithms. The obtained results evidence the challenging nature of the proposed dataset and the limitations of existing datasets for both volumetric video reconstruction and compression tasks, highlighting the need to develop more effective algorithms for these applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Photomechanics is a crucial branch of solid mechanics. The localization of point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems: trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization. Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion, based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate. Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) has been successfully applied to text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) 1.5. However, vanilla DMD suffers from convergence difficulties on large-scale flow-based text-to-image models, such as SD 3.5 and FLUX. In this paper, we first analyze the issues when applying vanilla DMD on large-scale models. Then, to overcome the scalability challenge, we propose implicit distribution alignment (IDA) to regularize the distance between the generator and fake distribution. Furthermore, we propose intra-segment guidance (ISG) to relocate the timestep importance distribution from the teacher model. With IDA alone, DMD converges for SD 3.5; employing both IDA and ISG, DMD converges for SD 3.5 and FLUX.1 dev. Along with other improvements such as scaled up discriminator models, our final model, dubbed \textbf{SenseFlow}, achieves superior performance in distillation for both diffusion based text-to-image models such as SDXL, and flow-matching models such as SD 3.5 Large and FLUX.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaption (TTA) has witnessed important progress in recent years, the prevailing methods typically first encode the image and the text and design strategies to model the association between them. Meanwhile, the image encoder is usually frozen due to the absence of explicit supervision in TTA scenarios. We identify a critical limitation in this paradigm: While test-time images often exhibit distribution shifts from training data, existing methods persistently freeze the image encoder due to the absence of explicit supervision during adaptation. This practice overlooks the image encoder's crucial role in bridging distribution shift between training and test. To address this challenge, we propose SSAM (Self-Supervised Association Modeling), a new TTA framework that enables dynamic encoder refinement through dual-phase association learning. Our method operates via two synergistic components: 1) Soft Prototype Estimation (SPE), which estimates probabilistic category associations to guide feature space reorganization, and 2) Prototype-anchored Image Reconstruction (PIR), enforcing encoder stability through cluster-conditional image feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across diverse baseline methods and benchmarks demonstrate that SSAM can surpass state-of-the-art TTA baselines by a clear margin while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework's architecture-agnostic design and minimal hyperparameter dependence further enhance its practical applicability.

  We propose UNSURF, a novel uncertainty measure for cortical surface reconstruction of clinical brain MRI scans of any orientation, resolution, and contrast. It relies on the discrepancy between predicted voxel-wise signed distance functions (SDFs) and the actual SDFs of the fitted surfaces. Our experiments on real clinical scans show that traditional uncertainty measures, such as voxel-wise Monte Carlo variance, are not suitable for modeling the uncertainty of surface placement. Our results demonstrate that UNSURF estimates correlate well with the ground truth errors and: \textit{(i)}~enable effective automated quality control of surface reconstructions at the subject-, parcel-, mesh node-level; and \textit{(ii)}~improve performance on a downstream Alzheimer's disease classification task.

  _Wei Tao, Xiaoyang Qu, Kai Lu, Jiguang Wan, Shenglin He, Jianzong Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Since the point cloud data is inherently irregular and unstructured, point cloud semantic segmentation has always been a challenging task. The graph-based method attempts to model the irregular point cloud by representing it as a graph; however, this approach incurs substantial computational cost due to the necessity of constructing a graph for every point within a large-scale point cloud. In this paper, we observe that boundary points possess more intricate spatial structural information and develop a novel graph attention network known as the Boundary-Aware Graph attention Network (BAGNet). On one hand, BAGNet contains a boundary-aware graph attention layer (BAGLayer), which employs edge vertex fusion and attention coefficients to capture features of boundary points, reducing the computation time. On the other hand, BAGNet employs a lightweight attention pooling layer to extract the global feature of the point cloud to maintain model accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that BAGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in point cloud semantic segmentation with higher accuracy and less inference time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates the performance of few-shot learning (FSL) approaches in recognizing Bangla handwritten characters and numerals using limited labeled data. It demonstrates the applicability of these methods to scripts with intricate and complex structures, where dataset scarcity is a common challenge. Given the complexity of Bangla script, we hypothesize that models performing well on these characters can generalize effectively to languages of similar or lower structural complexity. To this end, we introduce SynergiProtoNet, a hybrid network designed to improve the recognition accuracy of handwritten characters and digits. The model integrates advanced clustering techniques with a robust embedding framework to capture fine-grained details and contextual nuances. It leverages multi-level (both high- and low-level) feature extraction within a prototypical learning framework. We rigorously benchmark SynergiProtoNet against several state-of-the-art few-shot learning models: BD-CSPN, Prototypical Network, Relation Network, Matching Network, and SimpleShot, across diverse evaluation settings including Monolingual Intra-Dataset Evaluation, Monolingual Inter-Dataset Evaluation, Cross-Lingual Transfer, and Split Digit Testing. Experimental results show that SynergiProtoNet consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new benchmark in few-shot learning for handwritten character and digit recognition.

  In this paper, we address the crucial task of brain tumor segmentation in medical imaging and propose innovative approaches to enhance its performance. The current state-of-the-art nnU-Net has shown promising results but suffers from extensive training requirements and underutilization of pre-trained weights. To overcome these limitations, we integrate Axial-Coronal-Sagittal convolutions and pre-trained weights from ImageNet into the nnU-Net framework, resulting in reduced training epochs, reduced trainable parameters, and improved efficiency. Two strategies for transferring 2D pre-trained weights to the 3D domain are presented, ensuring the preservation of learned relationships and feature representations critical for effective information propagation. Furthermore, we explore a joint classification and segmentation model that leverages pre-trained encoders from a brain glioma grade classification proxy task, leading to enhanced segmentation performance, especially for challenging tumor labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods in the fast training settings achieve comparable or even outperform the ensemble of cross-validation models, a common practice in the brain tumor segmentation literature.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing prompt-based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in continual learning, leveraging pre-trained large-scale models for classification tasks; however, the tight coupling between foreground-background information and the coupled attention between prompts and image-text tokens present significant challenges in incremental medical object detection tasks, due to the conceptual gap between medical and natural domains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the \method~framework, which comprises two main components: 1) Instance-level Prompt Generation (\ipg), which decouples fine-grained instance-level knowledge from images and generates prompts that focus on dense predictions, and 2) Decoupled Prompt Attention (\dpa), which decouples the original prompt attention, enabling a more direct and efficient transfer of prompt information while reducing memory usage and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We collect 13 clinical, cross-modal, multi-organ, and multi-category datasets, referred to as \dataset, and experiments demonstrate that \method~outperforms existing SOTA methods, with FAP improvements of 5.44\%, 4.83\%, 12.88\%, and 4.59\% in full data, 1-shot, 10-shot, and 50-shot settings, respectively.

To bridge this, we present TF2025, an expanded dataset with synchronized first- and third-person views. In addition, we introduce a sequence-based method to identify first-person wearers in third-person footage, combining motion cues and person re-identification.

  Open-vocabulary object detection models allow users to freely specify a class vocabulary in natural language at test time, guiding the detection of desired objects. However, vocabularies can be overly broad or even mis-specified, hampering the overall performance of the detector. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Vocabulary Adapter (VocAda) to refine the user-defined vocabulary, automatically tailoring it to categories that are relevant for a given image. VocAda does not require any training, it operates at inference time in three steps: i) it uses an image captionner to describe visible objects, ii) it parses nouns from those captions, and iii) it selects relevant classes from the user-defined vocabulary, discarding irrelevant ones. Experiments on COCO and Objects365 with three state-of-the-art detectors show that VocAda consistently improves performance, proving its versatility. The code is open source.

  Despite recent advancements in latent diffusion models that generate high-dimensional image data and perform various downstream tasks, there has been little exploration into perceptual consistency within these models on the task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). In this paper, we hypothesize that latent diffusion models implicitly exhibit perceptually consistent local regions within the data manifold. We leverage this insight to guide on-manifold sampling using perceptual features and input measurements. Specifically, we propose Perceptual Manifold Guidance (PMG), an algorithm that utilizes pretrained latent diffusion models and perceptual quality features to obtain perceptually consistent multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps from the denoising U-Net. We empirically demonstrate that these hyperfeatures exhibit high correlation with human perception in IQA tasks. Our method can be applied to any existing pretrained latent diffusion model and is straightforward to integrate. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work on guiding diffusion model with perceptual features for NR-IQA. Extensive experiments on IQA datasets show that our method, LGDM, achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the superior generalization capabilities of diffusion models for NR-IQA tasks.

  Although deep learning-based visual tracking methods have made significant progress, they exhibit vulnerabilities when facing carefully designed adversarial attacks, which can lead to a sharp decline in tracking performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes for the first time a novel adversarial defense method based on denoise diffusion probabilistic models, termed DiffDf, aimed at effectively improving the robustness of existing visual tracking methods against adversarial attacks. DiffDf establishes a multi-scale defense mechanism by combining pixel-level reconstruction loss, semantic consistency loss, and structural similarity loss, effectively suppressing adversarial perturbations through a gradual denoising process. Extensive experimental results on several mainstream datasets show that the DiffDf method demonstrates excellent generalization performance for trackers with different architectures, significantly improving various evaluation metrics while achieving real-time inference speeds of over 30 FPS, showcasing outstanding defense performance and efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conventional training for optical flow and stereo depth models typically employs a uniform loss function across all pixels. However, this one-size-fits-all approach often overlooks the significant variations in learning difficulty among individual pixels and contextual regions. This paper investigates the uncertainty-based confidence maps which capture these spatially varying learning difficulties and introduces tailored solutions to address them. We first present the Difficulty Balancing (DB) loss, which utilizes an error-based confidence measure to encourage the network to focus more on challenging pixels and regions. Moreover, we identify that some difficult pixels and regions are affected by occlusions, resulting from the inherently ill-posed matching problem in the absence of real correspondences. To address this, we propose the Occlusion Avoiding (OA) loss, designed to guide the network into cycle consistency-based confident regions, where feature matching is more reliable. By combining the DB and OA losses, we effectively manage various types of challenging pixels and regions during training. Experiments on both optical flow and stereo depth tasks consistently demonstrate significant performance improvements when applying our proposed combination of the DB and OA losses.

  Recent work has shown that eliciting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate reasoning traces in natural language before answering the user's request can significantly improve their performance across tasks. This approach has been extended to multimodal LLMs, where the models can produce chain-of-thoughts (CoT) about the content of input images and videos. In this work, we propose to obtain video LLMs whose reasoning steps are grounded in, and explicitly refer to, the relevant video frames. For this, we first create CoF-Data, a large dataset of diverse questions, answers, and corresponding frame-grounded reasoning traces about both natural and synthetic videos, spanning various topics and tasks. Then, we fine-tune existing video LLMs on this chain-of-frames (CoF) data. Our approach is simple and self-contained, and, unlike existing approaches for video CoT, does not require auxiliary networks to select or caption relevant frames. We show that our models based on CoF are able to generate chain-of-thoughts that accurately refer to the key frames to answer the given question. This, in turn, leads to improved performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks, for example, surpassing leading video LLMs on Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, and notably reducing the hallucination rate.

  Video diffusion techniques have advanced significantly in recent years; however, they struggle to generate realistic imagery of car crashes due to the scarcity of accident events in most driving datasets. Improving traffic safety requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal. Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior diffusion-based methods.

  FastCAR is a novel task consolidation approach in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for a classification and a regression task, despite the non-triviality of task heterogeneity with only a subtle correlation. The approach addresses the classification of a detected object (occupying the entire image frame) and regression for modeling a continuous property variable (for instances of an object class), a crucial use case in science and engineering. FastCAR involves a label transformation approach that is amenable for use with only a single-task regression network architecture. FastCAR outperforms traditional MTL model families, parametrized in the landscape of architecture and loss weighting schemes, when learning both tasks are collectively considered (classification accuracy of 99.54%, regression mean absolute percentage error of 2.4%). The experiments performed used "Advanced Steel Property Dataset" contributed by usthis https URL. The dataset comprises 4536 images of 224x224 pixels, annotated with discrete object classes and its hardness property that can take continuous values. Our proposed FastCAR approach for task consolidation achieves training time efficiency (2.52x quicker) and reduced inference latency (55% faster) than benchmark MTL networks.

  This paper examines the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning for detecting endangered deer species in their natural habitats. As traditional identification processes require trained manual labor that can be costly in resources and time, there is a need for more efficient solutions. Leveraging high-resolution aerial imagery, advanced computer vision techniques are applied to automate the identification process of deer across two distinct projects in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first project, Pantano Project, involves the marsh deer in the Paran√° Delta, while the second, WiMoBo, focuses on the Pampas deer in Campos del Tuy√∫ National Park. A tailored algorithm was developed using the YOLO framework, trained on extensive datasets compiled from UAV-captured images. The findings demonstrate that the algorithm effectively identifies marsh deer with a high degree of accuracy and provides initial insights into its applicability to Pampas deer, albeit with noted limitations. This study not only supports ongoing conservation efforts but also highlights the potential of integrating AI with UAV technology to enhance wildlife monitoring and management practices.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in Sign Language Translation (SLT) has focussed primarily on improving the representational capacity of large language models to incorporate Sign Language features. This work explores an alternative direction: enhancing the geometric properties of skeletal representations themselves. We propose Geo-Sign, a method that leverages the properties of hyperbolic geometry to model the hierarchical structure inherent in sign language kinematics. By projecting skeletal features derived from Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCNs) into the Poincar√© ball model, we aim to create more discriminative embeddings, particularly for fine-grained motions like finger articulations. We introduce a hyperbolic projection layer, a weighted Fr√©chet mean aggregation scheme, and a geometric contrastive loss operating directly in hyperbolic space. These components are integrated into an end-to-end translation framework as a regularisation function, to enhance the representations within the language model. This work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic geometry to improve skeletal representations for Sign Language Translation, improving on SOTA RGB methods while preserving privacy and improving computational efficiency.

  The remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has attracted increasing attention to extend them to physical entities like legged robot. This typically requires MLLMs to not only grasp multimodal understanding abilities, but also integrate visual-spatial reasoning and physical interaction capabilities. Nevertheless,existing methods struggle to unify these capabilities due to their fundamentalthis http URLthis paper, we present the Visual Embodied Brain (VeBrain), a unified framework for perception, reasoning, and control in real world. VeBrain reformulates robotic control into common text-based MLLM tasks in the 2D visual space, thus unifying the objectives and mapping spaces of different tasks. Then, a novel robotic adapter is proposed to convert textual control signals from MLLMs to motion policies of real robots. From the data perspective, we further introduce VeBrain-600k, a high-quality instruction dataset encompassing various capabilities of VeBrain. In VeBrain-600k, we take hundreds of hours to collect, curate and annotate the data, and adopt multimodal chain-of-thought(CoT) to mix the different capabilities into a single conversation. Extensive experiments on 13 multimodal benchmarks and 5 spatial intelligence benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of VeBrain to existing MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL. When deployed to legged robots and robotic arms, VeBrain shows strong adaptability, flexibility, and compositional capabilities compared to existing methods. For example, compared to Qwen2.5-VL, VeBrain not only achieves substantial gains on MMVet by +5.6%, but also excels in legged robot tasks with +50% average gains.

  Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Yet, existing work on procedure-aware video representations fails to explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by LLMs as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, and more. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks.

  LiDAR semantic segmentation plays a vital role in autonomous driving. Existing voxel-based methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation apply uniform partition to the 3D LiDAR point cloud to form a structured representation based on cartesian/cylindrical coordinates. Although these methods show impressive performance, the drawback of existing voxel-based methods remains in two aspects: (1) it requires a large enough input voxel resolution, which brings a large amount of computation cost and memory consumption. (2) it does not well handle the unbalanced point distribution of LiDAR point cloud. In this paper, we propose a non-uniform cylindrical partition network named NUC-Net to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, we propose the Arithmetic Progression of Interval (API) method to non-uniformly partition the radial axis and generate the voxel representation which is representative and efficient. Moreover, we propose a non-uniform multi-scale aggregation method to improve contextual information. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets with much faster speed and much less training time. And our method can be a general component for LiDAR semantic segmentation, which significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of the uniform counterpart by $4 \times$ training faster and $2 \times$ GPU memory reduction and $3 \times$ inference speedup. We further provide theoretical analysis towards understanding why NUC is effective and how point distribution affects performance. Code is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal hallucination in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restricts the correctness of MLLMs. However, multimodal hallucinations are multi-sourced and arise from diverse causes. Existing benchmarks fail to adequately distinguish between perception-induced hallucinations and reasoning-induced hallucinations. This failure constitutes a significant issue and hinders the diagnosis of multimodal reasoning failures within MLLMs. To address this, we propose the {\dataset} benchmark, which isolates reasoning hallucinations by constructing questions where input images are correctly perceived by MLLMs yet reasoning errors persist. {\dataset} introduces multi-granular evaluation metrics: accuracy, factuality, and LLMs hallucination score for hallucination quantification. Our analysis reveals that (1) the model scale, data scale, and training stages significantly affect the degree of logical, fabrication, and factual hallucinations; (2) current MLLMs show no effective improvement on spatial hallucinations caused by misinterpreted spatial relationships, indicating their limited visual reasoning capabilities; and (3) question types correlate with distinct hallucination patterns, highlighting targeted challenges and potential mitigation strategies. To address these challenges, we propose {\method}, a method that combines curriculum reinforcement fine-tuning to encourage models to generate logic-consistent reasoning chains by stepwise reducing learning difficulty, and collaborative hint inference to reduce reasoning complexity. {\method} establishes a baseline on {\dataset}, and reduces the logical hallucinations in original base models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has become a promising solution for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach for Vision Transformer (ViT) models by partially fine-tuning learnable tokens while keeping most model parameters frozen. Recent research has explored modifying the connection structures of the prompts. However, the fundamental correlation and distribution between the prompts and image tokens remain unexplored. In this paper, we leverage metric learning techniques to investigate how the distribution of prompts affects fine-tuning performance. Specifically, we propose a novel framework, Distribution Aware Visual Prompt Tuning (DA-VPT), to guide the distributions of the prompts by learning the distance metric from their class-related semantic data. Our method demonstrates that the prompts can serve as an effective bridge to share semantic information between image patches and the class token. We extensively evaluated our approach on popular benchmarks in both recognition and segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach enables more effective and efficient fine-tuning of ViT models by leveraging semantic information to guide the learning of the prompts, leading to improved performance on various downstream vision tasks.

  In this report, we present OpenUni, a simple, lightweight, and fully open-source baseline for unifying multimodal understanding and generation. Inspired by prevailing practices in unified model learning, we adopt an efficient training strategy that minimizes the training complexity and overhead by bridging the off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models through a set of learnable queries and a light-weight transformer-based connector. With a minimalist choice of architecture, we demonstrate that OpenUni can: 1) generate high-quality and instruction-aligned images, and 2) achieve exceptional performance on standard benchmarks such as GenEval, DPG- Bench, and WISE, with only 1.1B and 3.1B activated parameters. To support open research and community advancement, we release all model weights, training code, and our curated training datasets (including 23M image-text pairs) atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) remains a persistent challenge in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) due to the inherent freedom of symbol layout and variability in handwriting styles. Prior methods have faced performance bottlenecks, proposing isolated architectural modifications that are difficult to integrate coherently into a unified framework. Meanwhile, recent advances in pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-task generalization, offering a promising foundation for developing unified solutions. In this paper, we introduce Uni-MuMER, which fully fine-tunes a VLM for the HMER task without modifying its architecture, effectively injecting domain-specific knowledge into a generalist framework. Our method integrates three data-driven tasks: Tree-Aware Chain-of-Thought (Tree-CoT) for structured spatial reasoning, Error-Driven Learning (EDL) for reducing confusion among visually similar characters, and Symbol Counting (SC) for improving recognition consistency in long expressions. Experiments on the CROHME and HME100K datasets show that Uni-MuMER achieves new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the best lightweight specialized model SSAN by 16.31% and the top-performing VLM Gemini2.5-flash by 24.42% in the zero-shot setting.

  We introduce a taxonomy of materials for hierarchical recognition from local appearance. Our taxonomy is motivated by vision applications and is arranged according to the physical traits of materials. We contribute a diverse, in-the-wild dataset with images and depth maps of the taxonomy classes. Utilizing the taxonomy and dataset, we present a method for hierarchical material recognition based on graph attention networks. Our model leverages the taxonomic proximity between classes and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate the model's potential to generalize to adverse, real-world imaging conditions, and that novel views rendered using the depth maps can enhance this capability. Finally, we show the model's capacity to rapidly learn new materials in a few-shot learning setting.

  _Xuwei Xu, Yang Li, Yudong Chen, Jiajun Liu, Sen Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We reveal that feedforward network (FFN) layers, rather than attention layers, are the primary contributors to Vision Transformer (ViT) inference latency, with their impact signifying as model size increases. This finding highlights a critical opportunity for optimizing the efficiency of large-scale ViTs by focusing on FFN layers. In this work, we propose a novel channel idle mechanism that facilitates post-training structural reparameterization for efficient FFN layers during testing. Specifically, a set of feature channels remains idle and bypasses the nonlinear activation function in each FFN layer, thereby forming a linear pathway that enables structural reparameterization during inference. This mechanism results in a family of ReParameterizable Vision Transformers (RePaViTs), which achieve remarkable latency reductions with acceptable sacrifices (sometimes gains) in accuracy across various ViTs. The benefits of our method scale consistently with model sizes, demonstrating greater speed improvements and progressively narrowing accuracy gaps or even higher accuracies on larger models. In particular, RePa-ViT-Large and RePa-ViT-Huge enjoy 66.8% and 68.7% speed-ups with +1.7% and +1.1% higher top-1 accuracies under the same training strategy, respectively. RePaViT is the first to employ structural reparameterization on FFN layers to expedite ViTs to our best knowledge, and we believe that it represents an auspicious direction for efficient ViTs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Distill CLIP (DCLIP), a fine-tuned variant of the CLIP model that enhances multimodal image-text retrieval while preserving the original model's strong zero-shot classification capabilities. CLIP models are typically constrained by fixed image resolutions and limited context, which can hinder their effectiveness in retrieval tasks that require fine-grained cross-modal understanding. DCLIP addresses these challenges through a meta teacher-student distillation framework, where a cross-modal transformer teacher is fine-tuned to produce enriched embeddings via bidirectional cross-attention between YOLO-extracted image regions and corresponding textual spans. These semantically and spatially aligned global representations guide the training of a lightweight student model using a hybrid loss that combines contrastive learning and cosine similarity objectives. Despite being trained on only ~67,500 samples curated from MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Conceptual Captions-just a fraction of CLIP's original dataset-DCLIP significantly improves image-text retrieval metrics (Recall@K, MAP), while retaining approximately 94% of CLIP's zero-shot classification performance. These results demonstrate that DCLIP effectively mitigates the trade-off between task specialization and generalization, offering a resource-efficient, domain-adaptive, and detail-sensitive solution for advanced vision-language tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Negative guidance -- explicitly suppressing unwanted attributes -- remains a fundamental challenge in diffusion models, particularly in few-step sampling regimes. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) works well in standard settings, it fails under aggressive sampling step compression due to divergent predictions between positive and negative branches. We present Normalized Attention Guidance (NAG), an efficient, training-free mechanism that applies extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement. NAG restores effective negative guidance where CFG collapses while maintaining fidelity. Unlike existing approaches, NAG generalizes across architectures (UNet, DiT), sampling regimes (few-step, multi-step), and modalities (image, video), functioning as a \textit{universal} plug-in with minimal computational overhead. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate consistent improvements in text alignment (CLIP Score), fidelity (FID, PFID), and human-perceived quality (ImageReward). Our ablation studies validate each design component, while user studies confirm significant preference for NAG-guided outputs. As a model-agnostic inference-time approach requiring no retraining, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion frameworks -- pseudocode in the Appendix!

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural fields (NFs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in scene reconstruction, powering various tasks such as novel view synthesis. However, existing NF methods relying on RGB or LiDAR inputs often exhibit severe fragility to adverse weather, particularly when applied in outdoor scenarios like autonomous driving. In contrast, millimeter-wave radar is inherently robust to environmental changes, while unfortunately, its integration with NFs remains largely underexplored. Besides, as outdoor driving scenarios frequently involve moving objects, making spatiotemporal modeling essential for temporally consistent novel view synthesis. To this end, we introduce RF4D, a radar-based neural field framework specifically designed for novel view synthesis in outdoor dynamic scenes. RF4D explicitly incorporates temporal information into its representation, significantly enhancing its capability to model moving objects. We further introduce a feature-level flow module that predicts latent temporal offsets between adjacent frames, enforcing temporal coherence in dynamic scene modeling. Moreover, we propose a radar-specific power rendering formulation closely aligned with radar sensing physics, improving synthesis accuracy and interoperability. Extensive experiments on public radar datasets demonstrate the superior performance of RF4D in terms of radar measurement synthesis quality and occupancy estimation accuracy, achieving especially pronounced improvements in dynamic outdoor scenarios.

  The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for human-like visual-spatial intelligence. Nevertheless, achieving deep spatial understanding comparable to human capabilities poses significant challenges in model encoding and data acquisition. Existing methods frequently depend on external depth sensors for geometry capture or utilize off-the-shelf algorithms for pre-constructing 3D maps, thereby limiting their scalability, especially with prevalent monocular video inputs and for time-sensitive applications. In this work, we introduce VLM-3R, a unified framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that incorporates 3D Reconstructive instruction tuning. VLM-3R processes monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D tokens that represent spatial understanding. Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View Fusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial context with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial assistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal reasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark, featuring over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving spatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, VLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables the understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy and scalability.

  Multi-modal object re-identification (ReID) aims to extract identity features across heterogeneous spectral modalities to enable accurate recognition and retrieval in complex real-world scenarios. However, most existing methods rely on implicit feature fusion structures, making it difficult to model fine-grained recognition strategies under varying challenging conditions. Benefiting from the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the visual appearance of an object can be effectively translated into descriptive text. In this paper, we propose a reliable multi-modal caption generation method based on attribute confidence, which significantly reduces the unknown recognition rate of MLLMs in multi-modal semantic generation and improves the quality of generated text. Additionally, we propose a novel ReID framework NEXT, the Multi-grained Mixture of Experts via Text-Modulation for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification. Specifically, we decouple the recognition problem into semantic and structural expert branches to separately capture modality-specific appearance and intrinsic structure. For semantic recognition, we propose the Text-Modulated Semantic-sampling Experts (TMSE), which leverages randomly sampled high-quality semantic texts to modulate expert-specific sampling of multi-modal features and mining intra-modality fine-grained semantic cues. Then, to recognize coarse-grained structure features, we propose the Context-Shared Structure-aware Experts (CSSE) that focuses on capturing the holistic object structure across modalities and maintains inter-modality structural consistency through a soft routing mechanism. Finally, we propose the Multi-Modal Feature Aggregation (MMFA), which adopts a unified feature fusion strategy to simply and effectively integrate semantic and structural expert outputs into the final identity representations.

  State-of-the-art text-to-motion generation models rely on the kinematic-aware, local-relative motion representation popularized by HumanML3D, which encodes motion relative to the pelvis and to the previous frame with built-in redundancy. While this design simplifies training for earlier generation models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and hinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion representation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned alternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global space. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this formulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text alignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and no auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally supports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and temporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and costly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we demonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices in motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and motion-related applications.

  Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography offers detailed insights into the structural connectivity of the brain, but presents challenges in effective representation and interpretation in deep learning models. In this work, we propose a novel 2D representation of DTI tractography that encodes tract-level fractional anisotropy (FA) values into a 9x9 grayscale image. This representation is processed through a Beta-Total Correlation Variational Autoencoder with a Spatial Broadcast Decoder to learn a disentangled and interpretable latent embedding. We evaluate the quality of this embedding using supervised and unsupervised representation learning strategies, including auxiliary classification, triplet loss, and SimCLR-based contrastive learning. Compared to the 1D Group deep neural network (DNN) baselines, our approach improves the F1 score in a downstream sex classification task by 15.74% and shows a better disentanglement than the 3D representation.

  Understanding infographic charts with design-driven visual elements (e.g., pictograms, icons) requires both visual recognition and reasoning, posing challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes 5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying data but differing in visual presentations. We further design visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding.

  Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information. However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 330 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Gaussian Splatting methods have emerged as a desirable substitute for prior Radiance Field methods for novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multi-view images or videos. In this work, we propose a novel extension to 4D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. Drawing on ideas from residual learning, we hierarchically decompose the dynamic scene into a "video-segment-frame" structure, with segments dynamically adjusted by optical flow. Then, instead of directly predicting the time-dependent signals, we model the signal as the sum of video-constant values, segment-constant values, and frame-specific residuals, as inspired by the success of residual learning. This approach allows more flexible models that adapt to highly variable scenes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets, with the greatest improvements on complex scenes with large movements, occlusions, and fine details, where current methods degrade most.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the use of RL beyond reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring (to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All), demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks (Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding, Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1 across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available atthis https URL.

  We aim to develop a robust yet flexible visual foundation model for Earth observation. It should possess strong capabilities in recognizing and localizing diverse visual targets while providing compatibility with various input-output interfaces required across different task scenarios. Current systems cannot meet these requirements, as they typically utilize task-specific architecture trained on narrow data domains with limited semantic coverage. Our study addresses these limitations from two aspects: data and modeling. We first introduce an automatic data engine that enjoys significantly better scalability compared to previous human annotation or rule-based approaches. It has enabled us to create the largest dataset of its kind to date, comprising 270K image-text-mask triplets covering an unprecedented range of diverse semantic categories and attribute specifications. Based on this data foundation, we further propose a task unification paradigm that centers around referring expression segmentation. It effectively handles a wide range of vision-centric perception tasks, including classification, detection, segmentation, grounding, etc, using a single model without any task-specific heads. Combining these innovations on data and modeling, we present RemoteSAM, a foundation model that establishes new SoTA on several earth observation perception benchmarks, outperforming other foundation models such as Falcon, GeoChat, and LHRS-Bot with significantly higher efficiency.

- **[Beyond Face Swapping: A Diffusion-Based Digital Human Benchmark for Multimodal Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16512)**  `arXiv:2505.16512`  
  _Jiaxin Liu, Jia Wang, Saihui Hou, Min Ren, Huijia Wu, Zhaofeng He_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, the explosive advancement of deepfake technology has posed a critical and escalating threat to public security: diffusion-based digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency via multimodal control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the new large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion models. Leveraging five of the latest digital human generation methods and a voice cloning method, we systematically construct a dataset comprising 60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data diversity and realism. User studies demonstrate that the misrecognition rate by participants for DigiFakeAV reaches as high as 68%. Moreover, the substantial performance degradation of existing detection models on our dataset further highlights its challenges. To address this problem, we propose DigiShield, an effective detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the DigiFakeAV and shows strong generalization on other datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-video understanding has emerged as a crucial capability in real-world applications such as video surveillance, meeting summarization, educational lecture analysis, and sports broadcasting. However, it remains computationally prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference. Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools across various domains, yet tailoring pre-trained models to exhibit specific desirable properties remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable, efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore, their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex, non-differentiable reward functions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains, including radiology report generation. Previous approaches have attempted to utilize multimodal LLMs for this task, enhancing their performance through the integration of domain-specific knowledge retrieval. However, these approaches often overlook the knowledge already embedded within the LLMs, leading to redundant information integration. To address this limitation, we propose Radar, a framework for enhancing radiology report generation with supplementary knowledge injection. Radar improves report generation by systematically leveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved information. Specifically, it first extracts the model's acquired knowledge that aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves relevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally, by aggregating both sources, Radar generates more accurate and informative radiology reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert-Plus, and IU X-ray demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in both language quality and clinical accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Event cameras are rapidly emerging as powerful vision sensors for 3D reconstruction, uniquely capable of asynchronously capturing per-pixel brightness changes. Compared to traditional frame-based cameras, event cameras produce sparse yet temporally dense data streams, enabling robust and accurate 3D reconstruction even under challenging conditions such as high-speed motion, low illumination, and extreme dynamic range scenarios. These capabilities offer substantial promise for transformative applications across various fields, including autonomous driving, robotics, aerial navigation, and immersive virtual reality. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review exclusively dedicated to event-based 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches are systematically categorised based on input modality into stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and further classified according to reconstruction methodologies, including geometry-based techniques, deep learning approaches, and neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Within each category, methods are chronologically organised to highlight the evolution of key concepts and advancements. Furthermore, we provide a detailed summary of publicly available datasets specifically suited to event-based reconstruction tasks. Finally, we discuss significant open challenges in dataset availability, standardised evaluation, effective representation, and dynamic scene reconstruction, outlining insightful directions for future research. This survey aims to serve as an essential reference and provides a clear and motivating roadmap toward advancing the state of the art in event-driven 3D reconstruction.

  We introduce IrrMap, the first large-scale dataset (1.1 million patches) for irrigation method mapping across regions. IrrMap consists of multi-resolution satellite imagery from LandSat and Sentinel, along with key auxiliary data such as crop type, land use, and vegetation indices. The dataset spans 1,687,899 farms and 14,117,330 acres across multiple western U.S. states from 2013 to 2023, providing a rich and diverse foundation for irrigation analysis and ensuring geospatial alignment and quality control. The dataset is ML-ready, with standardized 224x224 GeoTIFF patches, the multiple input modalities, carefully chosen train-test-split data, and accompanying dataloaders for seamless deep learning model training andbenchmarking in irrigation mapping. The dataset is also accompanied by a complete pipeline for dataset generation, enabling researchers to extend IrrMap to new regions for irrigation data collection or adapt it with minimal effort for other similar applications in agricultural and geospatial analysis. We also analyze the irrigation method distribution across crop groups, spatial irrigation patterns (using Shannon diversity indices), and irrigated area variations for both LandSat and Sentinel, providing insights into regional and resolution-based differences. To promote further exploration, we openly release IrrMap, along with the derived datasets, benchmark models, and pipeline code, through a GitHub repository:this https URLand Data repository:this https URL, providing comprehensive documentation and implementation details.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image segmentation is a powerful computer vision technique for scene understanding. However, real-world deployment is stymied by the need for high-quality, meticulously labeled datasets. Synthetic data provides high-quality labels while reducing the need for manual data collection and annotation. However, deep neural networks trained on synthetic data often face the Syn2Real problem, leading to poor performance in real-world deployments.To mitigate the aforementioned gap in image segmentation, we propose RAFT, a novel framework for adapting image segmentation models using minimal labeled real-world data through data and feature augmentations, as well as active learning. To validate RAFT, we perform experiments on the synthetic-to-real "SYNTHIA->Cityscapes" and "GTAV->Cityscapes" benchmarks. We managed to surpass the previous state of the art, HALO. SYNTHIA->Cityscapes experiences an improvement in mIoU* upon domain adaptation of 2.1%/79.9%, and GTAV->Cityscapes experiences a 0.4%/78.2% improvement in mIoU. Furthermore, we test our approach on the real-to-real benchmark of "Cityscapes->ACDC", and again surpass HALO, with a gain in mIoU upon adaptation of 1.3%/73.2%. Finally, we examine the effect of the allocated annotation budget and various components of RAFT upon the final transfer mIoU.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Apparent personality analysis from short videos poses significant chal-lenges due to the complex interplay of visual, auditory, and textual cues. In this paper, we propose GAME, a Graph-Augmented Multimodal Encoder designed to robustly model and fuse multi-source features for automatic personality prediction. For the visual stream, we construct a facial graph and introduce a dual-branch Geo Two-Stream Network, which combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNNs) with attention mechanisms to capture both structural and appearance-based facial cues. Complementing this, global context and iden-tity features are extracted using pretrained ResNet18 and VGGFace back-bones. To capture temporal dynamics, frame-level features are processed by a BiGRU enhanced with temporal attention modules. Meanwhile, audio representations are derived from the VGGish network, and linguistic se-mantics are captured via the XLM-Roberta transformer. To achieve effective multimodal integration, we propose a Channel Attention-based Fusion module, followed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression head for predicting personality traits. Extensive experiments show that GAME con-sistently outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks, vali-dating its effectiveness and generalizability.

  _Joseph Kettelkamp, Ludovica Romanin, Sarv Priya, Mathews Jacob_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce an unsupervised motion-compensated image reconstruction algorithm for free-breathing and ungated 3D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We express the image volume corresponding to each specific motion phase as the deformation of a single static image template. The main contribution of the work is the low-rank model for the compact joint representation of the family of diffeomorphisms, parameterized by the motion phases. The diffeomorphism at a specific motion phase is obtained by integrating a parametric velocity field along a path connecting the reference template phase to the motion phase. The velocity field at different phases is represented using a low-rank model. The static template and the low-rank motion model parameters are learned directly from the k-space data in an unsupervised fashion. The more constrained motion model is observed to offer improved recovery compared to current motion-resolved and motion-compensated algorithms for free-breathing 3D cine MRI.

  _Chenxi Li, Weijie Wang, Qiang Li, Bruno Lepri, Nicu Sebe, Weizhi Nie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-driven object insertion in 3D scenes is an emerging task that enables intuitive scene editing through natural language. However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans naturally understand 3D spatial relationships, enabling complex reasoning like predicting collisions of vehicles from different directions. Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction.

  _Siyi Chen, Yimeng Zhang, Sijia Liu, Qing Qu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent studies have shown that they can memorize and create harmful content when given specific text prompts. Although fine-tuning approaches have been developed to mitigate this issue by unlearning harmful concepts, these methods can be easily circumvented through jailbreaking attacks. This implies that the harmful concept has not been fully erased from the model. However, existing jailbreaking attack methods, while effective, lack interpretability regarding why unlearned models still retain the concept, thereby hindering the development of defense strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by proposing an attack method that learns an orthogonal set of interpretable attack token embeddings. The attack token embeddings can be decomposed into human-interpretable textual elements, revealing that unlearned models still retain the target concept through implicit textual components. Furthermore, these attack token embeddings are powerful and transferable across text prompts, initial noises, and unlearned models, emphasizing that unlearned models are more vulnerable than expected. Finally, building on the insights from our interpretable attack, we develop a defense method to protect unlearned models against both our proposed and existing jailbreaking attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack and defense strategies.

  Robust tooling and publicly available pre-trained models have helped drive recent advances in mechanistic interpretability for language models. However, similar progress in vision mechanistic interpretability has been hindered by the lack of accessible frameworks and pre-trained weights. We present Prisma (Access the codebase here:this https URL), an open-source framework designed to accelerate vision mechanistic interpretability research, providing a unified toolkit for accessing 75+ vision and video transformers; support for sparse autoencoder (SAE), transcoder, and crosscoder training; a suite of 80+ pre-trained SAE weights; activation caching, circuit analysis tools, and visualization tools; and educational resources. Our analysis reveals surprising findings, including that effective vision SAEs can exhibit substantially lower sparsity patterns than language SAEs, and that in some instances, SAE reconstructions can decrease model loss. Prisma enables new research directions for understanding vision model internals while lowering barriers to entry in this emerging field.

  _Zhiyuan Fan, Yumeng Wang, Sandeep Polisetty, Yi R. Fung_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) excel in various vision-language tasks. Yet, their robustness to visual variations in position, scale, orientation, and context that objects in natural scenes inevitably exhibit due to changes in viewpoint and environment remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce V$^2$R-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating Visual Variation Robustness of LVLMs, which encompasses automated evaluation dataset generation and principled metrics for thorough robustness assessment. Through extensive evaluation on 21 LVLMs, we reveal a surprising vulnerability to visual variations, in which even advanced models that excel at complex vision-language tasks significantly underperform on simple tasks such as object recognition. Interestingly, these models exhibit a distinct visual position bias that contradicts theories of effective receptive fields, and demonstrate a human-like visual acuity threshold. To identify the source of these vulnerabilities, we present a systematic framework for component-level analysis, featuring a novel visualization approach for aligned visual features. Results show that these vulnerabilities stem from error accumulation in the pipeline architecture and inadequate multimodal alignment. Complementary experiments with synthetic data further demonstrate that these limitations are fundamentally architectural deficiencies, scoring the need for architectural innovations in future LVLM designs.

  _Jingshun Huang, Haitao Lin, Tianyu Wang, Yanwei Fu, Xiangyang Xue, Yi Zhu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper tackles category-level pose estimation of articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks and introduces a new benchmark dataset. While recent methods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on geometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from the point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation for 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images, leading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for estimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method combines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS representations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified network to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets, and NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted class based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part. Finally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to recover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we introduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date, featuring photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real sensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Real-world deployments of our model in robotic tasks underscore its robustness and exceptional sim-to-real transfer capabilities, confirming its substantial practical utility. Our dataset, code and pre-trained models are available on the project page.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human Pose Estimation (HPE) involves detecting and localizing keypoints on the human body from visual data. In 3D HPE, occlusions, where parts of the body are not visible in the image, pose a significant challenge for accurate pose reconstruction. This paper presents a benchmark on the robustness of 3D HPE models under realistic occlusion conditions, involving combinations of occluded keypoints commonly observed in real-world scenarios. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D HPE models, spanning convolutional, transformer-based, graph-based, and diffusion-based architectures, using the BlendMimic3D dataset, a synthetic dataset with ground-truth 2D/3D annotations and occlusion labels. All models were originally trained on Human3.6M and tested here without retraining to assess their generalization. We introduce a protocol that simulates occlusion by adding noise into 2D keypoints based on real detector behavior, and conduct both global and per-joint sensitivity analyses. Our findings reveal that all models exhibit notable performance degradation under occlusion, with diffusion-based models underperforming despite their stochastic nature. Additionally, a per-joint occlusion analysis identifies consistent vulnerability in distal joints (e.g., wrists, feet) across models. Overall, this work highlights critical limitations of current 3D HPE models in handling occlusions, and provides insights for improving real-world robustness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The use of Augmented Reality (AR) devices for surgical guidance has gained increasing traction in the medical field. Traditional registration methods often rely on external fiducial markers to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance. However, these markers introduce cumbersome calibration procedures and can be challenging to deploy in clinical settings. While commercial solutions have attempted real-time markerless tracking using the native RGB cameras of AR devices, their accuracy remains questionable for medical guidance, primarily due to occlusions and significant outliers between the live sensor data and the preoperative target anatomy point cloud derived from MRI or CT scans. In this work, we present a markerless framework that relies only on the depth sensor of AR devices and consists of two modules: a registration module for high-precision, outlier-robust target anatomy localization, and a tracking module for real-time pose estimation. The registration module integrates depth sensor error correction, a human-in-the-loop region filtering technique, and a robust global alignment with curvature-aware feature sampling, followed by local ICP refinement, for markerless alignment of preoperative models with patient anatomy. The tracking module employs a fast and robust registration algorithm that uses the initial pose from the registration module to estimate the target pose in real-time. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of both modules through simulation and real-world measurements. The results indicate that our markerless system achieves superior performance for registration and comparable performance for tracking to industrial solutions. The two-module design makes our system a one-stop solution for surgical procedures where the target anatomy moves or stays static during surgery.

  A versatile video depth estimation model should (1) be accurate and consistent across frames, (2) produce high-resolution depth maps, and (3) support real-time streaming. We propose FlashDepth, a method that satisfies all three requirements, performing depth estimation on a 2044x1148 streaming video at 24 FPS. We show that, with careful modifications to pretrained single-image depth models, these capabilities are enabled with relatively little data and training. We evaluate our approach across multiple unseen datasets against state-of-the-art depth models, and find that ours outperforms them in terms of boundary sharpness and speed by a significant margin, while maintaining competitive accuracy. We hope our model will enable various applications that require high-resolution depth, such as video editing, and online decision-making, such as robotics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose OmniCaptioner, a versatile visual captioning framework for generating fine-grained textual descriptions across a wide variety of visual domains. Unlike prior methods limited to specific image types (e.g., natural images or geometric visuals), our framework provides a unified solution for captioning natural images, visual text (e.g., posters, UIs, textbooks), and structured visuals (e.g., documents, tables, charts). By converting low-level pixel information into semantically rich textual representations, our framework bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities. Our results highlight three key advantages: (i) Enhanced Visual Reasoning with LLMs, where long-context captions of visual modalities empower LLMs, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 series, to reason effectively in multimodal scenarios; (ii) Improved Image Generation, where detailed captions improve tasks like text-to-image generation and image transformation; and (iii) Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which enables faster convergence with less data. We believe the versatility and adaptability of OmniCaptioner can offer a new perspective for bridging the gap between language and visual modalities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Marine Saliency Segmentation (MSS) plays a pivotal role in various vision-based marine exploration tasks. However, existing marine segmentation techniques face the dilemma of object mislocalization and imprecise boundaries due to the complex underwater environment. Meanwhile, despite the impressive performance of diffusion models in visual segmentation, there remains potential to further leverage contextual semantics to enhance feature learning of region-level salient objects, thereby improving segmentation outcomes. Building on this insight, we propose DiffMSS, a novel marine saliency segmenter based on the diffusion model, which utilizes semantic knowledge distillation to guide the segmentation of marine salient objects. Specifically, we design a region-word similarity matching mechanism to identify salient terms at the word level from the text descriptions. These high-level semantic features guide the conditional feature learning network in generating salient and accurate diffusion conditions with semantic knowledge distillation. To further refine the segmentation of fine-grained structures in unique marine organisms, we develop the dedicated consensus deterministic sampling to suppress overconfident missegmentations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DiffMSS over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

  _Ji Woo Hong, Tri Ton, Trung X. Pham, Gwanhyeong Koo, Sunjae Yoon, Chang D. Yoo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces ITA-MDT, the Image-Timestep-Adaptive Masked Diffusion Transformer Framework for Image-Based Virtual Try-On (IVTON), designed to overcome the limitations of previous approaches by leveraging the Masked Diffusion Transformer (MDT) for improved handling of both global garment context and fine-grained details. The IVTON task involves seamlessly superimposing a garment from one image onto a person in another, creating a realistic depiction of the person wearing the specified garment. Unlike conventional diffusion-based virtual try-on models that depend on large pre-trained U-Net architectures, ITA-MDT leverages a lightweight, scalable transformer-based denoising diffusion model with a mask latent modeling scheme, achieving competitive results while reducing computational overhead. A key component of ITA-MDT is the Image-Timestep Adaptive Feature Aggregator (ITAFA), a dynamic feature aggregator that combines all of the features from the image encoder into a unified feature of the same size, guided by diffusion timestep and garment image complexity. This enables adaptive weighting of features, allowing the model to emphasize either global information or fine-grained details based on the requirements of the denoising stage. Additionally, the Salient Region Extractor (SRE) module is presented to identify complex region of the garment to provide high-resolution local information to the denoising model as an additional condition alongside the global information of the full garment image. This targeted conditioning strategy enhances detail preservation of fine details in highly salient garment regions, optimizing computational resources by avoiding unnecessarily processing entire garment image. Comparative evaluations confirms that ITA-MDT improves efficiency while maintaining strong performance, reaching state-of-the-art results in several metrics.

  The synergy between generative and discriminative models receives growing attention. While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) excels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained visual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take CLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found that visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation enhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge from generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore critical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We found that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude that utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective strategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage training strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements. (3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers with desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our in-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely GenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark, e.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP. The enhanced CLIP can be further plugged into multimodal large language models for better vision-centric performance. All the models and codes are made publicly available.

  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing, yet 2D Parametric Primitive Analysis (PPA) remains underexplored due to two key challenges: structural constraint reasoning and advanced semantic understanding. To tackle these challenges, we first propose an Efficient Hybrid Parametrization (EHP) for better representing 2D engineering drawings. EHP contains four types of atomic component i.e., point, line, circle, and arc). Additionally, we propose PHT-CAD, a novel 2D PPA framework that harnesses the modality alignment and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for precise engineering drawing analysis. In PHT-CAD, we introduce four dedicated regression heads to predict corresponding atomic components. To train PHT-CAD, a three-stage training paradigm Progressive Hierarchical Tuning (PHT) is proposed to progressively enhance PHT-CAD's capability to perceive individual primitives, infer structural constraints, and align annotation layers with their corresponding geometric representations. Considering that existing datasets lack complete annotation layers and real-world engineering drawings, we introduce ParaCAD, the first large-scale benchmark that explicitly integrates both the geometric and annotation layers. ParaCAD comprises over 10 million annotated drawings for training and 3,000 real-world industrial drawings with complex topological structures and physical constraints for test. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PHT-CAD and highlight the practical significance of ParaCAD in advancing 2D PPA research.

  Human action-reaction synthesis, a fundamental challenge in modeling causal human interactions, plays a critical role in applications ranging from virtual reality to social robotics. While diffusion-based models have demonstrated promising performance, they exhibit two key limitations for interaction synthesis: reliance on complex noise-to-reaction generators with intricate conditional mechanisms, and frequent physical violations in generated motions. To address these issues, we propose Action-Reaction Flow Matching (ARFlow), a novel framework that establishes direct action-to-reaction mappings, eliminating the need for complex conditional mechanisms. Our approach introduces a physical guidance mechanism specifically designed for Flow Matching (FM) that effectively prevents body penetration artifacts during sampling. Moreover, we discover the bias of traditional flow matching sampling algorithm and employ a reprojection method to revise the sampling direction of FM. To further enhance the reaction diversity, we incorporate randomness into the sampling process. Extensive experiments on NTU120, Chi3D and InterHuman datasets demonstrate that ARFlow not only outperforms existing methods in terms of Fr√©chet Inception Distance and motion diversity but also significantly reduces body collisions, as measured by our new Intersection Volume and Intersection Frequency metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote sensing object detection (RSOD) often suffers from degradations such as low spatial resolution, sensor noise, motion blur, and adverse illumination. These factors diminish feature distinctiveness, leading to ambiguous object representations and inadequate foreground-background separation. Existing RSOD methods exhibit limitations in robust detection of low-quality objects. To address these pressing challenges, we introduce LEGNet, a lightweight backbone network featuring a novel Edge-Gaussian Aggregation (EGA) module specifically engineered to enhance feature representation derived from low-quality remote sensing images. EGA module integrates: (a) orientation-aware Scharr filters to sharpen crucial edge details often lost in low-contrast or blurred objects, and (b) Gaussian-prior-based feature refinement to suppress noise and regularize ambiguous feature responses, enhancing foreground saliency under challenging conditions. EGA module alleviates prevalent problems in reduced contrast, structural discontinuities, and ambiguous feature responses prevalent in degraded images, effectively improving model robustness while maintaining computational efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across five benchmarks (DOTA-v1.0, v1.5, DIOR-R, FAIR1M-v1.0, and VisDrone2019) demonstrate that LEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in detecting low-quality objects.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing score-based adversarial attacks mainly focus on crafting $top$-1 adversarial examples against classifiers with single-label classification. Their attack success rate and query efficiency are often less than satisfactory, particularly under small perturbation requirements; moreover, the vulnerability of classifiers with multi-label learning is yet to be studied. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive surrogate free score-based attack, named \b geometric \b score-based \b black-box \b attack (GSBA$^K$), to craft adversarial examples in an aggressive $top$-$K$ setting for both untargeted and targeted attacks, where the goal is to change the $top$-$K$ predictions of the target classifier. We introduce novel gradient-based methods to find a good initial boundary point to attack. Our iterative method employs novel gradient estimation techniques, particularly effective in $top$-$K$ setting, on the decision boundary to effectively exploit the geometry of the decision boundary. Additionally, GSBA$^K$ can be used to attack against classifiers with $top$-$K$ multi-label learning. Extensive experimental results on ImageNet and PASCAL VOC datasets validate the effectiveness of GSBA$^K$ in crafting $top$-$K$ adversarial examples.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) is challenging due to the strong similarity between camouflaged objects and their surroundings, which complicates identification. Existing methods mainly rely on spatial local features, failing to capture global information, while Transformers increase computational costs. To address this, the Frequency-Assisted Mamba-Like Linear Attention Network (FMNet) is proposed, which leverages frequency-domain learning to efficiently capture global features and mitigate ambiguity between objects and the background. FMNet introduces the Multi-Scale Frequency-Assisted Mamba-Like Linear Attention (MFM) module, integrating frequency and spatial features through a multi-scale structure to handle scale variations while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, the Pyramidal Frequency Attention Extraction (PFAE) module and the Frequency Reverse Decoder (FRD) enhance semantics and reconstruct features. Experimental results demonstrate that FMNet outperforms existing methods on multiple COD datasets, showcasing its advantages in both performance and efficiency. Code available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) aims to reduce the scales of pretrained models for multiple downstream tasks. However, as the models keep scaling up, the memory footprint of existing PETL methods is not significantly reduced compared to the reduction of learnable parameters. This limitation hinders the practical deployment of PETL methods on memory-constrained devices. To this end, we proposed a new PETL framework, called Structure to Activation (S2A), to reduce the memory footprint of activation during fine-tuning. Specifically, our framework consists of: 1) Activation modules design(i.e., bias, prompt and side modules) in the parametric model structure, which results in a significant reduction of adjustable parameters and activation memory; 2) 4-bit quantization of activations based on their derivatives for non-parametric structures (e.g., nonlinear functions), which maintains accuracy while significantly reducing memory usage. Our S2A method consequently offers a lightweight solution in terms of both parameters and memory footprint. We evaluated S2A with different backbones and performed extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate the effectiveness. The results show that our methods not only outperform existing PETL techniques, achieving a fourfold reduction in GPU memory footprint on average, but also shows competitive performance in accuracy with fewer tunable parameters. These demonstrate that our method is highly suitable for practical transfer learning on hardware-constrained devices.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive models have achieved promising results in natural language processing. However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research. We will make our code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a crucial task in computer vision, aiming to recognize individuals across non-overlapping camera views. While recent advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in logical reasoning and multi-task generalization, their applications in Re-ID tasks remain limited. They either struggle to perform accurate matching based on identity-relevant features or assist image-dominated branches as auxiliary semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ChatReID, that shifts the focus towards a text-side-dominated retrieval paradigm, enabling flexible and interactive re-identification. To integrate the reasoning abilities of language models into Re-ID pipelines, We first present a large-scale instruction dataset, which contains more than 8 million prompts to promote the model fine-tuning. Next. we introduce a hierarchical progressive tuning strategy, which endows Re-ID ability through three stages of tuning, i.e., from person attribute understanding to fine-grained image retrieval and to multi-modal task reasoning. Extensive experiments across ten popular benchmarks demonstrate that ChatReID outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in all Re-ID tasks. More experiments demonstrate that ChatReID not only has the ability to recognize fine-grained details but also to integrate them into a coherent reasoning process.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution to automate the workflow of machine learning, but most existing methods share a common limitation: they attempt to optimize entire pipelines in a single step before evaluation, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific changes. This lack of granularity leads to unstable optimization and slower convergence, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce Iterative Refinement, a novel strategy for LLM-driven ML pipeline design inspired by how human ML experts iteratively refine models, focusing on one component at a time rather than making sweeping changes all at once. By systematically updating individual components based on real training feedback, Iterative Refinement improves overall model performance. We also provide some theoretical edvience of the superior properties of this Iterative Refinement. Further, we implement this strategy in IMPROVE, an end-to-end LLM agent framework for automating and optimizing object classification pipelines. Through extensive evaluations across datasets of varying sizes and domains, we demonstrate that Iterative Refinement enables IMPROVE to consistently achieve better performance over existing zero-shot LLM-based approaches.

  How can we verify whether copyrighted content was used to train a large vision-language model (VLM) without direct access to its training data? Motivated by the hypothesis that a VLM is able to recognize images from its training corpus, we propose DIS-CO, a novel approach to infer the inclusion of copyrighted content during the model's development. By repeatedly querying a VLM with specific frames from targeted copyrighted material, DIS-CO extracts the content's identity through free-form text completions. To assess its effectiveness, we introduce MovieTection, a benchmark comprising 14,000 frames paired with detailed captions, drawn from films released both before and after a model's training cutoff. Our results show that DIS-CO significantly improves detection performance, nearly doubling the average AUC of the best prior method on models with logits available. Our findings also highlight a broader concern: all tested models appear to have been exposed to some extent to copyrighted content. Our code and data are available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To satisfy the rigorous requirements of precise edge detection in critical high-accuracy measurements, this article proposes a series of efficient approaches for localizing subpixel edge. In contrast to the fitting based methods, which consider pixel intensity as a sample value derived from a specific model. We take an innovative perspective by assuming that the intensity at the pixel level can be interpreted as a local integral mapping in the intensity model for subpixel localization. Consequently, we propose a straightforward subpixel edge localization method called Converted Intensity Summation (CIS). To address the limited robustness associated with focusing solely on the localization of individual edge points, a Stable Edge Region (SER) based algorithm is presented to alleviate local interference near edges. Given the observation that the consistency of edge statistics exists in the local region, the algorithm seeks correlated stable regions in the vicinity of edges to facilitate the acquisition of robust parameters and achieve higher precision positioning. In addition, an edge complement method based on extension-adjustment is also introduced to rectify the irregular edges through the efficient migration of SERs. A large number of experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real image datasets which cover common edge patterns as well as various real scenarios such as industrial PCB images, remote sensing and medical images. It is verified that CIS can achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art method, while requiring less execution time. Moreover, by integrating SER into CIS, the proposed algorithm demonstrates excellent performance in further improving the anti-interference capability and positioning accuracy.

The method was then integrated into an automated pipeline where it processed over 5,500 registry exams without human assistance, in exams with all 5 vessels it achieved 98% classification and 90% segmentation accuracy.Flow curves from successful segmentations were used to train MultiFlowDTC, which applied deep temporal clustering to identify distinct flow phenotypes. Survival analysis revealed distinct phenotypes were significantly associated with increased risk of death/transplantation and liver disease, demonstrating the potential of the framework.

  Pre-trained Vision Transformers now serve as powerful tools for computer vision. Yet, efficiently adapting them for multiple tasks remains a challenge that arises from the need to modify the rich hidden representations encoded by the learned weight matrices, without inducing interference between tasks. Current parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, which apply low-rank updates, force tasks to compete within constrained subspaces, ultimately degrading performance. We introduce DiTASK a novel Diffeomorphic Multi-Task Fine-Tuning approach that maintains pre-trained representations by preserving weight matrix singular vectors, while enabling task-specific adaptations through neural diffeomorphic transformations of the singular values. By following this approach, DiTASK enables both shared and task-specific feature modulations with minimal added parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that DITASK achieves full-rank updates during optimization, preserving the geometric structure of pre-trained features, and establishing a new paradigm for efficient multi-task learning (MTL). Our experiments on PASCAL MTL and NYUD show that DiTASK achieves state-of-the-art performance across four dense prediction tasks, using 75% fewer parameters than existing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multiple works have emerged to push the boundaries on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) towards pixel-level understanding. The current trend in pixel-level MLLMs is to train with pixel-level grounding supervision on large-scale labelled data with specialized decoders for the segmentation task. However, we show that such MLLMs when evaluated on recent challenging vision-centric benchmarks, exhibit a weak ability in visual question answering (VQA). Surprisingly, some of these methods even downgrade the grounding ability of MLLMs that were never trained with such pixel-level supervision. In this work, we propose two novel challenging benchmarks with paired evaluation for both VQA and grounding. We show that MLLMs without pixel-level grounding supervision can outperform the state of the art in such tasks. Our paired benchmarks and evaluation enable additional analysis on the reasons for failure with respect to VQA and/or grounding. Furthermore, we propose simple baselines to extract the grounding information that can be plugged into any MLLM, which we call PixFoundation. More importantly, we study the research question of "When does grounding emerge in MLLMs that are not trained with pixel-level grounding supervision?" We show that grounding can coincide with object parts, its location, appearance, context or state, where we show 27-45% of the examples in both benchmarks exhibit this phenomenon. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available and some are in the supplemental.

  Explaining deep neural networks is challenging, due to their large size and non-linearity. In this paper, we introduce a concept-based explanation method, in order to explain the prediction for an individual class, as well as contrasting any two classes, i.e. explain why the model predicts one class over the other. We test it on several openly available classification models trained on ImageNet1K. We perform both qualitative and quantitative tests. For example, for a ResNet50 model from pytorch model zoo, we can use the explanation for why the model predicts a class 'A' to automatically select four dataset crops where the model does not predict class 'A'. The model then predicts class 'A' again for the newly combined image in 91.1% of the cases (works for 911 out of the 1000 classes).

  Segmentation is an important analysis task for biomedical images, enabling the study of individual organelles, cells or organs. Deep learning has massively improved segmentation methods, but challenges remain in generalization to new conditions, requiring costly data annotation. Vision foundation models, such as Segment Anything Model (SAM), address this issue through improved generalization. However, these models still require finetuning on annotated data, although with less annotations, to achieve optimal results for new conditions. As a downside, they require more computational resources. This makes parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) relevant. We contribute the first comprehensive study of PEFT for SAM applied to biomedical images. We find that the placement of PEFT layers is more important for efficiency than the type of layer for vision transformers and we provide a recipe for resource-efficient finetuning.

  The remarkable progress in text-to-video diffusion models enables photorealistic generations, although the contents of the generated video often include unnatural movement or deformation, reverse playback, and motionless scenes. Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of the content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at inference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video quality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline that we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into lookahead steps for reward estimation over search budget or denoising steps.

  Multimodal models often experience a significant performance drop when one or more modalities are missing during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality without requiring explicit modality generation or auxiliary networks. To efficiently learn these approximations with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning. The code and pretrained models will be released on GitHub.

  Algorithmic level developments like Convolutional Neural Networks, transformers, attention mechanism, Retrieval Augmented Generation and so on have changed Artificial Intelligence. Recent such development was observed by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks that suggested to challenge the fundamental concept of a Neural Network, thus change Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Networks. They received a good reception in terms of scientific modeling, yet had some drawbacks in terms of efficiency. In this paper, we train Convolutional Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (CKANs) with the ImageNet-1k dataset with 1.3 million images, MNIST dataset with 60k images and a tabular biological science related MoA dataset and test the promise of CKANs in terms of FLOPS, Inference Time, number of trainable parameters and training time against the accuracy, precision, recall and f-1 score they produce against the standard industry practice on CNN models. We show that the CKANs perform fair yet slower than CNNs in small size dataset like MoA and MNIST but are not nearly comparable as the dataset gets larger and more complex like the ImageNet.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising results, yet existing approaches struggle to effectively handle both temporal and spatial localization simultaneously. This challenge stems from two key issues: first, incorporating spatial-temporal localization introduces a vast number of coordinate combinations, complicating the alignment of linguistic and visual coordinate representations; second, encoding fine-grained temporal and spatial information during video feature compression is inherently difficult. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-ST, a MLLM for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. In LLaVA-ST, we propose Language-Aligned Positional Embedding, which embeds the textual coordinate special token into the visual space, simplifying the alignment of fine-grained spatial-temporal correspondences. Additionally, we design the Spatial-Temporal Packer, which decouples the feature compression of temporal and spatial resolutions into two distinct point-to-region attention processing streams. Furthermore, we propose ST-Align dataset with 4.3M training samples for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. With ST-align, we present a progressive training pipeline that aligns the visual and textual feature through sequential coarse-to-finethis http URL, we introduce an ST-Align benchmark to evaluate spatial-temporal interleaved fine-grained understanding tasks, which include Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) , Event Localization and Captioning (ELC) and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG). LLaVA-ST achieves outstanding performance on 11 benchmarks requiring fine-grained temporal, spatial, or spatial-temporal interleaving multimodal understanding.

Recently, more research has focused on the development of marker-less methods based on deep learning. However, acquiring realistic surgical data, with ground truth instrument poses, required for deep learning training, is challenging. To address the issues in surgical instrument pose estimation, we introduce the Surgical Robot Instrument Pose Estimation (SurgRIPE) challenge, hosted at the 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2023. The objectives of this challenge are: (1) to provide the surgical vision community with realistic surgical video data paired with ground truth instrument poses, and (2) to establish a benchmark for evaluating markerless pose estimation methods. The challenge led to the development of several novel algorithms that showcased improved accuracy and robustness over existing methods. The performance evaluation study on the SurgRIPE dataset highlights the potential of these advanced algorithms to be integrated into robotic surgery systems, paving the way for more precise and autonomous surgical procedures. The SurgRIPE challenge has successfully established a new benchmark for the field, encouraging further research and development in surgical robot instrument pose estimation.

  Vision Language Models (VLMs) are impressive at visual question answering and image captioning. But they underperform on multi-step visual reasoning -- even compared to LLMs on the same tasks presented in text form -- giving rise to perceptions of modality imbalance or brittleness. Towards a systematic study of such issues, we introduce a synthetic framework for assessing the ability of VLMs to perform algorithmic visual reasoning, comprising three tasks: Table Readout, Grid Navigation, and Visual Analogy. Each has two levels of difficulty, SIMPLE and HARD, and even the SIMPLE versions are difficult for frontier VLMs. We propose strategies for training on the SIMPLE version of tasks that improve performance on the corresponding HARD task, i.e., simple-to-hard (S2H) generalization. This controlled setup, where each task also has an equivalent text-only version, allows a quantification of the modality imbalance and how it is impacted by training strategy. We show that 1) explicit image-to-text conversion is important in promoting S2H generalization on images, by transferring reasoning from text; 2) conversion can be internalized at test time. We also report results of mechanistic study of this phenomenon. We identify measures of gradient alignment that can identify training strategies that promote better S2H generalization. Ablations highlight the importance of chain-of-thought.

  In this work, we explore the trade-offs of explicit structural priors, particularly group equivariance. We address this through theoretical analysis and a comprehensive empirical study. To enable controlled and fair comparisons, we introduce \texttt{Rapidash}, a unified group convolutional architecture that allows for different variants of equivariant and non-equivariant models. Our results suggest that more constrained equivariant models outperform less constrained alternatives when aligned with the geometry of the task, and increasing representation capacity does not fully eliminate performance gaps. We see improved performance of models with equivariance and symmetry-breaking through tasks like segmentation, regression, and generation across diverse datasets. Explicit \textit{symmetry breaking} via geometric reference frames consistently improves performance, while \textit{breaking equivariance} through geometric input features can be helpful when aligned with task geometry. Our results provide task-specific performance trends that offer a more nuanced way for model selection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To improve the generalization of the autonomous driving (AD) perception model, vehicles need to update the model over time based on the continuously collected data. As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.

  Medical imaging provides essential visual insights for diagnosis, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly utilized for its analysis due to their strong generalization capabilities; however, the underlying factors driving this generalization remain unclear. Current research suggests that multi-task training outperforms single-task as different tasks can benefit each other, but they often overlook the internal relationships within these tasks. To analyze this phenomenon, we attempted to employ compositional generalization (CG), which refers to the models' ability to understand novel combinations by recombining learned elements, as a guiding framework. Since medical images can be precisely defined by Modality, Anatomical area, and Task, naturally providing an environment for exploring CG, we assembled 106 medical datasets to create Med-MAT for comprehensive experiments. The experiments confirmed that MLLMs can use CG to understand unseen medical images and identified CG as one of the main drivers of the generalization observed in multi-task training. Additionally, further studies demonstrated that CG effectively supports datasets with limited data and confirmed that MLLMs can achieve CG across classification and detection tasks, underscoring its broader generalization potential.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal learning has achieved remarkable success by integrating information from various modalities, achieving superior performance in tasks like recognition and retrieval compared to uni-modal approaches. However, real-world scenarios often present novel modalities that are unseen during training due to resource and privacy constraints, a challenge current methods struggle to address. This paper introduces Modality Generalization (MG), which focuses on enabling models to generalize to unseen modalities. We define two cases: Weak MG, where both seen and unseen modalities can be mapped into a joint embedding space via existing perceptors, and Strong MG, where no such mappings exist. To facilitate progress, we propose a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-modal algorithms and adapt existing methods that focus on generalization. Extensive experiments highlight the complexity of MG, exposing the limitations of existing methods and identifying key directions for future research. Our work provides a foundation for advancing robust and adaptable multi-modal models, enabling them to handle unseen modalities in realistic scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intelligent robots need to interact with diverse objects across various environments. The appearance and state of objects frequently undergo complex transformations depending on the object properties, e.g., phase transitions. However, in the vision community, segmenting dynamic objects with phase transitions is overlooked. In light of this, we introduce the concept of phase in segmentation, which categorizes real-world objects based on their visual characteristics and potential morphological and appearance changes. Then, we present a new benchmark, Multi-Phase, Multi-Transition, and Multi-Scenery Video Object Segmentation (M$^3$-VOS), to verify the ability of models to understand object phases, which consists of 479 high-resolution videos spanning over 10 distinct everyday scenarios. It provides dense instance mask annotations that capture both object phases and their transitions. We evaluate state-of-the-art methods on M$^3$-VOS, yielding several key insights. Notably, current appearance-based approaches show significant room for improvement when handling objects with phase transitions. The inherent changes in disorder suggest that the predictive performance of the forward entropy-increasing process can be improved through a reverse entropy-reducing process. These findings lead us to propose ReVOS, a new plug-andplay model that improves its performance by reversal refinement. Our data and code will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Dyn-HaMR, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to reconstruct 4D global hand motion from monocular videos recorded by dynamic cameras in the wild. Reconstructing accurate 3D hand meshes from monocular videos is a crucial task for understanding human behaviour, with significant applications in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). However, existing methods for monocular hand reconstruction typically rely on a weak perspective camera model, which simulates hand motion within a limited camera frustum. As a result, these approaches struggle to recover the full 3D global trajectory and often produce noisy or incorrect depth estimations, particularly when the video is captured by dynamic or moving cameras, which is common in egocentric scenarios. Our Dyn-HaMR consists of a multi-stage, multi-objective optimization pipeline, that factors in (i) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to robustly estimate relative camera motion, (ii) an interacting-hand prior for generative infilling and to refine the interaction dynamics, ensuring plausible recovery under (self-)occlusions, and (iii) hierarchical initialization through a combination of state-of-the-art hand tracking methods. Through extensive evaluations on both in-the-wild and indoor datasets, we show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of 4D global mesh recovery. This establishes a new benchmark for hand motion reconstruction from monocular video with moving cameras. Our project page is atthis https URL.

  We present a real-time monocular dense SLAM system designed bottom-up from MASt3R, a two-view 3D reconstruction and matching prior. Equipped with this strong prior, our system is robust on in-the-wild video sequences despite making no assumption on a fixed or parametric camera model beyond a unique camera centre. We introduce efficient methods for pointmap matching, camera tracking and local fusion, graph construction and loop closure, and second-order global optimisation. With known calibration, a simple modification to the system achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks. Altogether, we propose a plug-and-play monocular SLAM system capable of producing globally-consistent poses and dense geometry while operating at 15 FPS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in text-guided image editing enable users to perform image edits through simple text inputs, leveraging the extensive priors of multi-step diffusion-based text-to-image models. However, these methods often fall short of the speed demands required for real-world and on-device applications due to the costly multi-step inversion and sampling process involved. In response to this, we introduce SwiftEdit, a simple yet highly efficient editing tool that achieve instant text-guided image editing (in 0.23s). The advancement of SwiftEdit lies in its two novel contributions: a one-step inversion framework that enables one-step image reconstruction via inversion and a mask-guided editing technique with our proposed attention rescaling mechanism to perform localized image editing. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SwiftEdit. In particular, SwiftEdit enables instant text-guided image editing, which is extremely faster than previous multi-step methods (at least 50 times faster) while maintain a competitive performance in editing results.

  Medical vision-language models often struggle with generating accurate quantitative measurements in radiology reports, leading to hallucinations that undermine clinical reliability. We introduce FactCheXcker, a modular framework that de-hallucinates radiology report measurements by leveraging an improved query-code-update paradigm. Specifically, FactCheXcker employs specialized modules and the code generation capabilities of large language models to solve measurement queries generated based on the original report. After extracting measurable findings, the results are incorporated into an updated report. We evaluate FactCheXcker on endotracheal tube placement, which accounts for an average of 78% of report measurements, using the MIMIC-CXR dataset and 11 medical report-generation models. Our results show that FactCheXcker significantly reduces hallucinations, improves measurement precision, and maintains the quality of the original reports. Specifically, FactCheXcker improves the performance of 10/11 models and achieves an average improvement of 135.0% in reducing measurement hallucinations measured by mean absolute error.

  Pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly applied to real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) task. Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present DGGS, a novel framework that addresses the previously unexplored challenge: $\textbf{Distractor-free Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting}$ (3DGS). It mitigates 3D inconsistency and training instability caused by distractor data in the cross-scenes generalizable train setting while enabling feedforward inference for 3DGS and distractor masks from references in the unseen scenes. To achieve these objectives, DGGS proposes a scene-agnostic reference-based mask prediction and refinement module during the training phase, effectively eliminating the impact of distractor on training stability. Moreover, we combat distractor-induced artifacts and holes at inference time through a novel two-stage inference framework for references scoring and re-selection, complemented by a distractor pruning mechanism that further removes residual distractor 3DGS-primitive influences. Extensive feedforward experiments on the real and our synthetic data show DGGS's reconstruction capability when dealing with novel distractor scenes. Moreover, our generalizable mask prediction even achieves an accuracy superior to existing scene-specific training methods. Homepage isthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language generative reward models (VL-GenRMs) play a crucial role in aligning and evaluating multimodal AI systems, yet their own evaluation remains under-explored. Current assessment methods primarily rely on AI-annotated preference labels from traditional VL tasks, which can introduce biases and often fail to effectively challenge state-of-the-art models. To address these limitations, we introduce VL-RewardBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning general multimodal queries, visual hallucination detection, and complex reasoning tasks. Through our AI-assisted annotation pipeline that combines sample selection with human verification, we curate 1,250 high-quality examples specifically designed to probe VL-GenRMs limitations. Comprehensive evaluation across 16 leading large vision-language models demonstrates VL-RewardBench's effectiveness as a challenging testbed, where even GPT-4o achieves only 65.4% accuracy, and state-of-the-art open-source models such as Qwen2-VL-72B, struggle to surpass random-guessing. Importantly, performance on VL-RewardBench strongly correlates (Pearson's r $>$ 0.9) with MMMU-Pro accuracy using Best-of-N sampling with VL-GenRMs. Analysis experiments uncover three critical insights for improving VL-GenRMs: (i) models predominantly fail at basic visual perception tasks rather than reasoning tasks; (ii) inference-time scaling benefits vary dramatically by model capacity; and (iii) training VL-GenRMs to learn to judge substantially boosts judgment capability (+14.7% accuracy for a 7B VL-GenRM). We believe VL-RewardBench along with the experimental insights will become a valuable resource for advancing VL-GenRMs.

  Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generate diverse, high-quality images. However, they are surprisingly inept when it comes to rendering human hands, which are often anatomically incorrect or reside in the "uncanny valley". In this paper, we propose a method HandCraft for restoring such malformed hands. This is achieved by automatically constructing masks and depth images for hands as conditioning signals using a parametric model, allowing a diffusion-based image editor to fix the hand's anatomy and adjust its pose while seamlessly integrating the changes into the original image, preserving pose, color, and style. Our plug-and-play hand restoration solution is compatible with existing pretrained diffusion models, and the restoration process facilitates adoption by eschewing any fine-tuning or training requirements for the diffusion models. We also contribute MalHand datasets that contain generated images with a wide variety of malformed hands in several styles for hand detector training and hand restoration benchmarking, and demonstrate through qualitative and quantitative evaluation that HandCraft not only restores anatomical correctness but also maintains the integrity of the overall image.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose TextDestroyer, the first training- and annotation-free method for scene text destruction using a pre-trained diffusion model. Existing scene text removal models require complex annotation and retraining, and may leave faint yet recognizable text information, compromising privacy protection and content concealment. TextDestroyer addresses these issues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text masks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a Gaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising process, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent to restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion step are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect background restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it eliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2) it achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and (3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both real-world scenes and generated images.

  As commonly used implicit geometry representations, the signed distance function (SDF) is limited to modeling watertight shapes, while the unsigned distance function (UDF) is capable of representing various surfaces. However, its inherent theoretical shortcoming, i.e., the non-differentiability at the zero level set, would result in sub-optimal reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose the scaled-squared distance function (S$^{2}$DF), a novel implicit surface representation for modeling arbitrary surface types. S$^{2}$DF does not distinguish between inside and outside regions while effectively addressing the non-differentiability issue of UDF at the zero level set. We demonstrate that S$^{2}$DF satisfies a second-order partial differential equation of Monge-Ampere-type, allowing us to develop a learning pipeline that leverages a novel Monge-Ampere regularization to directly learn S$^{2}$DF from raw unoriented point clouds without supervision from ground-truth S$^{2}$DF values. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised approaches that require ground-truth surface information as supervision for training.

  Machine Unlearning (MU) is critical for removing private or hazardous information from deep learning models. While MU has advanced significantly in unimodal (text or vision) settings, multimodal unlearning (MMU) remains underexplored due to the lack of open benchmarks for evaluating cross-modal data removal. To address this gap, we introduce CLEAR, the first open-source benchmark designed specifically for MMU. CLEAR contains 200 fictitious individuals and 3,700 images linked with corresponding question-answer pairs, enabling a thorough evaluation across modalities.

  Visual Question Answer (VQA) poses the problem of answering a natural language question about a visual context. Bangla, despite being a widely spoken language, is considered low-resource in the realm of VQA due to the lack of proper benchmarks, challenging models known to be performant in other languages. Furthermore, existing Bangla VQA datasets offer little regional relevance and are largely adapted from their foreign counterparts. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale Bangla VQA dataset, ChitroJera, totaling over 15k samples from diverse and locally relevant data sources. We assess the performance of text encoders, image encoders, multimodal models, and our novel dual-encoder models. The experiments reveal that the pre-trained dual-encoders outperform other models of their scale. We also evaluate the performance of current large vision language models (LVLMs) using prompt-based techniques, achieving the overall best performance. Given the underdeveloped state of existing datasets, we envision ChitroJera expanding the scope of Vision-Language tasks in Bangla.

  Interactive 3D simulated objects are crucial in AR/VR, animations, and robotics, driving immersive experiences and advanced automation. However, creating these articulated objects requires extensive human effort and expertise, limiting their broader applications. To overcome this challenge, we present Articulate-Anything, a system that automates the articulation of diverse, complex objects from many input modalities, including text, images, and videos. Articulate-Anything leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate code that can be compiled into an interactable digital twin for use in standard 3D simulators. Our system exploits existing 3D asset datasets via a mesh retrieval mechanism, along with an actor-critic system that iteratively proposes, evaluates, and refines solutions for articulating the objects, self-correcting errors to achieve a robust outcome. Qualitative evaluations demonstrate Articulate-Anything's capability to articulate complex and even ambiguous object affordances by leveraging rich grounded inputs. In extensive quantitative experiments on the standard PartNet-Mobility dataset, Articulate-Anything substantially outperforms prior work, increasing the success rate from 8.7-11.6% to 75% and setting a new bar for state-of-the-art performance. We further showcase the utility of our system by generating 3D assets from in-the-wild video inputs, which are then used to train robotic policies for fine-grained manipulation tasks in simulation that go beyond basic pick and place. These policies are then transferred to a real robotic system.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point clouds, as a primary representation of 3D data, can be categorized into scene domain point clouds and object domain point clouds. Point cloud self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a mainstream paradigm for learning 3D representations. However, existing point cloud SSL primarily focuses on learning domain-specific 3D representations within a single domain, neglecting the complementary nature of cross-domain knowledge, which limits the learning of 3D representations. In this paper, we propose to learn a comprehensive Point cloud Mixture-of-Domain-Experts model (Point-MoDE) via a block-to-scene pre-training strategy. Specifically, we first propose a mixture-of-domain-expert model consisting of scene domain experts and multiple shared object domain experts. Furthermore, we propose a block-to-scene pretraining strategy, which leverages the features of point blocks in the object domain to regress their initial positions in the scene domain through object-level block mask reconstruction and scene-level block position regression. By integrating the complementary knowledge between object and scene, this strategy simultaneously facilitates the learning of both object-domain and scene-domain representations, leading to a more comprehensive 3D representation. Extensive experiments in downstream tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Organizing unstructured image collections into semantic clusters is a long-standing challenge. Traditional deep clustering techniques address this by producing a single data partition, whereas multiple clustering methods uncover diverse alternative partitions-but only when users predefine the clustering criteria. Yet expecting users to specify such criteria a priori for large, unfamiliar datasets is unrealistic. In this work, we introduce the task of Open-ended Semantic Multiple Clustering (OpenSMC), which aims to automatically discover clustering criteria from large, unstructured image collections, revealing interpretable substructures without human input. Our framework, X-Cluster: eXploratory Clustering, treats text as a reasoning proxy: it concurrently scans the entire image collection, proposes candidate criteria in natural language, and groups images into meaningful clusters per criterion. To evaluate progress, we release COCO-4c and Food-4c benchmarks, each annotated with four grouping criteria. Experiments show that X-Cluster effectively reveals meaningful partitions and enables downstream applications such as bias discovery and social media image popularity analysis.

  _Leo Bringer, Joey Wilson, Kira Barton, Maani Ghaffari_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a Multi-modal Diffusion model for Motion Prediction (MDMP) that integrates and synchronizes skeletal data and textual descriptions of actions to generate refined long-term motion predictions with quantifiable uncertainty. Existing methods for motion forecasting or motion generation rely solely on either prior motions or text prompts, facing limitations with precision or control, particularly over extended durations. The multi-modal nature of our approach enhances the contextual understanding of human motion, while our graph-based transformer framework effectively capture both spatial and temporal motion dynamics. As a result, our model consistently outperforms existing generative techniques in accurately predicting long-term motions. Additionally, by leveraging diffusion models' ability to capture different modes of prediction, we estimate uncertainty, significantly improving spatial awareness in human-robot interactions by incorporating zones of presence with varying confidence levels for each body joint.

  Conditional image synthesis based on user-specified requirements is a key component in creating complex visual content. In recent years, diffusion-based generative modeling has become a highly effective way for conditional image synthesis, leading to exponential growth in the literature. However, the complexity of diffusion-based modeling, the wide range of image synthesis tasks, and the diversity of conditioning mechanisms present significant challenges for researchers to keep up with rapid developments and to understand the core concepts on this topic. In this survey, we categorize existing works based on how conditions are integrated into the two fundamental components of diffusion-based modeling, $\textit{i.e.}$, the denoising network and the sampling process. We specifically highlight the underlying principles, advantages, and potential challenges of various conditioning approaches during the training, re-purposing, and specialization stages to construct a desired denoising network. We also summarize six mainstream conditioning mechanisms in the sampling process. All discussions are centered around popular applications. Finally, we pinpoint several critical yet still unsolved problems and suggest some possible solutions for future research. Our reviewed works are itemized atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SeaSplat, a method to enable real-time rendering of underwater scenes leveraging recent advances in 3D radiance fields. Underwater scenes are challenging visual environments, as rendering through a medium such as water introduces both range and color dependent effects on image capture. We constrain 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a recent advance in radiance fields enabling rapid training and real-time rendering of full 3D scenes, with a physically grounded underwater image formation model. Applying SeaSplat to the real-world scenes from SeaThru-NeRF dataset, a scene collected by an underwater vehicle in the US Virgin Islands, and simulation-degraded real-world scenes, not only do we see increased quantitative performance on rendering novel viewpoints from the scene with the medium present, but are also able to recover the underlying true color of the scene and restore renders to be without the presence of the intervening medium. We show that the underwater image formation helps learn scene structure, with better depth maps, as well as show that our improvements maintain the significant computational improvements afforded by leveraging a 3D Gaussian representation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning has revolutionized medical and biological imaging, particularly in segmentation tasks. However, segmenting biological cells remains challenging due to the high variability and complexity of cell shapes. Addressing this challenge requires high-quality datasets that accurately represent the diverse morphologies found in biological cells. Existing cell segmentation datasets are often limited by their focus on regular and uniform shapes. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset of Ntera-2 (NT2) cells, a pluripotent carcinoma cell line, exhibiting diverse morphologies across multiple stages of differentiation, capturing the intricate and heterogeneous cellular structures that complicate segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for complex cellular morphology segmentation (MorphoSeg) by incorporating sampling of virtual outliers from low-likelihood regions during training. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate that MorphoSeg significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, achieving up to a 7.74% increase in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and a 28.36% reduction in the Hausdorff Distance. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our dataset and methodology in advancing cell segmentation capabilities, especially for complex and variable cell morphologies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot Semantic Segmentation addresses the challenge of segmenting objects in query images with only a handful of annotated examples. However, many previous state-of-the-art methods either have to discard intricate local semantic features or suffer from high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a new Few-shot Semantic Segmentation framework based on the Transformer architecture. Our approach introduces the spatial transformer decoder and the contextual mask generation module to improve the relational understanding between support and query images. Moreover, we introduce a multi scale decoder to refine the segmentation mask by incorporating features from different resolutions in a hierarchical manner. Additionally, our approach integrates global features from intermediate encoder stages to improve contextual understanding, while maintaining a lightweight structure to reduce complexity. This balance between performance and efficiency enables our method to achieve competitive results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Notably, our model with only 1.5 million parameters demonstrates competitive performance while overcoming limitations of existing methodologies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid development of photo-realistic face generation methods has raised significant concerns in society and academia, highlighting the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection (FFD) techniques. Although existing approaches mainly capture face forgery patterns using image modality, other modalities like fine-grained noises and texts are not fully explored, which limits the generalization capability of the model. In addition, most FFD methods tend to identify facial images generated by GAN, but struggle to detect unseen diffusion-synthesized ones. To address the limitations, we aim to leverage the cutting-edge foundation model, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), to achieve generalizable diffusion face forgery detection (DFFD). In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal fine-grained CLIP (MFCLIP) model, which mines comprehensive and fine-grained forgery traces across image-noise modalities via language-guided face forgery representation learning, to facilitate the advancement of DFFD. Specifically, we devise a fine-grained language encoder (FLE) that extracts fine global language features from hierarchical text prompts. We design a multi-modal vision encoder (MVE) to capture global image forgery embeddings as well as fine-grained noise forgery patterns extracted from the richest patch, and integrate them to mine general visual forgery traces. Moreover, we build an innovative plug-and-play sample pair attention (SPA) method to emphasize relevant negative pairs and suppress irrelevant ones, allowing cross-modality sample pairs to conduct more flexible alignment. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that our model outperforms the state of the arts on different settings like cross-generator, cross-forgery, and cross-dataset evaluations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current vision-language multimodal models are well-adapted for general visual understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. We establish a benchmark called Human Pose and Action Understanding Benchmark (HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and evaluate it on the benchmark, achieving significant improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 21.18% compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent Vision Mamba (Vim) models exhibit nearly linear complexity in sequence length, making them highly attractive for processing visual data. However, the training methodologies and their potential are still not sufficiently explored. In this paper, we investigate strategies for Vim and propose Stochastic Layer-Wise Shuffle (SLWS), a novel regularization method that can effectively improve the Vim training. Without architectural modifications, this approach enables the non-hierarchical Vim to get leading performance on ImageNet-1K compared with the similar type counterparts. Our method operates through four simple steps per layer: probability allocation to assign layer-dependent shuffle rates, operation sampling via Bernoulli trials, sequence shuffling of input tokens, and order restoration of outputs. SLWS distinguishes itself through three principles: \textit{(1) Plug-and-play:} No architectural modifications are needed, and it is deactivated during inference. \textit{(2) Simple but effective:} The four-step process introduces only random permutations and negligible overhead. \textit{(3) Intuitive design:} Shuffling probabilities grow linearly with layer depth, aligning with the hierarchical semantic abstraction in vision models. Our work underscores the importance of tailored training strategies for Vim models and provides a helpful way to explore their scalability.

  Character animation is a transformative field in computer graphics and vision, enabling dynamic and realistic video animations from static images. Despite advancements, maintaining appearance consistency in animations remains a challenge. Our approach addresses this by introducing a training-free framework that ensures the generated video sequence preserves the reference image's subtleties, such as physique and proportions, through a dual alignment strategy. We decouple skeletal and motion priors from pose information, enabling precise control over animation generation. Our method also improves pixel-level alignment for conditional control from the reference character, enhancing the temporal consistency and visual cohesion of animations. Our method significantly enhances the quality of video generation without the need for large datasets or expensive computational resources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The underwater 3D scene reconstruction is a challenging, yet interesting problem with applications ranging from naval robots to VR experiences. The problem was successfully tackled by fully volumetric NeRF-based methods which can model both the geometry and the medium (water). Unfortunately, these methods are slow to train and do not offer real-time rendering. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method offered a fast alternative to NeRFs. However, because it is an explicit method that renders only the geometry, it cannot render the medium and is therefore unsuited for underwater reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that fuses volumetric rendering with 3DGS to handle underwater data effectively. Our method employs 3DGS for explicit geometry representation and a separate volumetric field (queried once per pixel) for capturing the scattering medium. This dual representation further allows the restoration of the scenes by removing the scattering medium. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods in rendering quality on the underwater SeaThru-NeRF dataset. Furthermore, it does so while offering real-time rendering performance, addressing the efficiency limitations of existing methods. Web:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With generative models producing high quality images that are indistinguishable from real ones, there is growing concern regarding the malicious usage of AI-generated images. Imperceptible image watermarking is one viable solution towards such concerns. Prior watermarking methods map the image to a latent space for adding the watermark. Moreover, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) generate the image in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder. We argue that this latent space can be used to integrate watermarking into the generation process. To this end, we present LaWa, an in-generation image watermarking method designed for LDMs. By using coarse-to-fine watermark embedding modules, LaWa modifies the latent space of pre-trained autoencoders and achieves high robustness against a wide range of image transformations while preserving perceptual quality of the image. We show that LaWa can also be used as a general image watermarking method. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LaWa outperforms previous works in perceptual quality, robustness against attacks, and computational complexity, while having very low false positive rate.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  More and more end-to-end text spotting methods based on Transformer architecture have demonstrated superior performance. These methods utilize a bipartite graph matching algorithm to perform one-to-one optimal matching between predicted objects and actual objects. However, the instability of bipartite graph matching can lead to inconsistent optimization targets, thereby affecting the training performance of the model. Existing literature applies denoising training to solve the problem of bipartite graph matching instability in object detection tasks. Unfortunately, this denoising training method cannot be directly applied to text spotting tasks, as these tasks need to perform irregular shape detection tasks and more complex text recognition tasks than classification. To address this issue, we propose a novel denoising training method (DNTextSpotter) for arbitrary-shaped text spotting. Specifically, we decompose the queries of the denoising part into noised positional queries and noised content queries. We use the four Bezier control points of the Bezier center curve to generate the noised positional queries. For the noised content queries, considering that the output of the text in a fixed positional order is not conducive to aligning position with content, we employ a masked character sliding method to initialize noised content queries, thereby assisting in the alignment of text content and position. To improve the model's perception of the background, we further utilize an additional loss function for background characters classification in the denoising trainingthis http URLDNTextSpotter is conceptually simple, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks (Total-Text, SCUT-CTW1500, ICDAR15, and Inverse-Text), especially yielding an improvement of 11.3% against the best approach in Inverse-Text dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Measuring urban safety perception is an important and complex task that traditionally relies heavily on human resources. This process often involves extensive field surveys, manual data collection, and subjective assessments, which can be time-consuming, costly, and sometimes inconsistent. Street View Images (SVIs), along with deep learning methods, provide a way to realize large-scale urban safety detection. However, achieving this goal often requires extensive human annotation to train safety ranking models, and the architectural differences between cities hinder the transferability of these models. Thus, a fully automated method for conducting safety evaluations is essential. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated powerful reasoning and analytical capabilities. Cutting-edge models, e.g., GPT-4 have shown surprising performance in many tasks. We employed these models for urban safety ranking on a human-annotated anchor set and validated that the results from MLLMs align closely with human perceptions. Additionally, we proposed a method based on the pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) feature and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) retrieval to quickly assess the safety index of the entire city. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing training needed deep learning approaches, achieving efficient and accurate urban safety evaluations. The proposed automation for urban safety perception assessment is a valuable tool for city planners, policymakers, and researchers aiming to improve urban environments.

  With a surge of large-scale pre-trained models, parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) of large models has garnered significant attention. While promising, they commonly rely on two optimistic assumptions: 1) full access to the parameters of a PTM, and 2) sufficient memory capacity to cache all intermediate activations for gradient computation. However, in most real-world applications, PTMs serve as black-box APIs or proprietary software without full parameter accessibility. Besides, it is hard to meet a large memory requirement for modern PTMs. This work proposes black-box visual prompting (BlackVIP), which efficiently adapts the PTMs without knowledge of their architectures or parameters. BlackVIP has two components: 1) Coordinator and 2) simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation with gradient correction (SPSA-GC). The Coordinator designs input-dependent visual prompts, which allow the target PTM to adapt in the wild. SPSA-GC efficiently estimates the gradient of PTM to update Coordinator. Besides, we introduce a variant, BlackVIP-SE, which significantly reduces the runtime and computational cost of BlackVIP. Extensive experiments on 19 datasets demonstrate that BlackVIPs enable robust adaptation to diverse domains and tasks with minimal memory requirements. We further provide a theoretical analysis on the generalization of visual prompting methods by presenting their connection to the certified robustness of randomized smoothing, and presenting an empirical support for improved robustness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the task of mixed-view panorama synthesis, where the goal is to synthesize a novel panorama given a small set of input panoramas and a satellite image of the area. This contrasts with previous work which only uses input panoramas (same-view synthesis), or an input satellite image (cross-view synthesis). We argue that the mixed-view setting is the most natural to support panorama synthesis for arbitrary locations worldwide. A critical challenge is that the spatial coverage of panoramas is uneven, with few panoramas available in many regions of the world. We introduce an approach that utilizes diffusion-based modeling and an attention-based architecture for extracting information from all available input imagery. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. In particular, our model can handle scenarios when the available panoramas are sparse or far from the location of the panorama we are attempting to synthesize.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The costly and time-consuming annotation process to produce large training sets for modelling semantic LiDAR segmentation methods has motivated the development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods. However, such SSL approaches often concentrate on employing consistency learning only for individual LiDAR representations. This narrow focus results in limited perturbations that generally fail to enable effective consistency learning. Additionally, these SSL approaches employ contrastive learning based on the sampling from a limited set of positive and negative embedding samples. This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation framework called ItTakesTwo (IT2). IT2 is designed to ensure consistent predictions from peer LiDAR representations, thereby improving the perturbation effectiveness in consistency learning. Furthermore, our contrastive learning employs informative samples drawn from a distribution of positive and negative embeddings learned from the entire training set. Results on public benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the field. The code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Flash3D, a method for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis from a single image which is both very generalisable and efficient. For generalisability, we start from a "foundation" model for monocular depth estimation and extend it to a full 3D shape and appearance reconstructor. For efficiency, we base this extension on feed-forward Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we predict a first layer of 3D Gaussians at the predicted depth, and then add additional layers of Gaussians that are offset in space, allowing the model to complete the reconstruction behind occlusions and truncations. Flash3D is very efficient, trainable on a single GPU in a day, and thus accessible to most researchers. It achieves state-of-the-art results when trained and tested on RealEstate10k. When transferred to unseen datasets like NYU it outperforms competitors by a large margin. More impressively, when transferred to KITTI, Flash3D achieves better PSNR than methods trained specifically on that dataset. In some instances, it even outperforms recent methods that use multiple views as input. Code, models, demo, and more results are available atthis https URL.

  Adapting models to dynamic, real-world environments characterized by shifting data distributions and unseen test scenarios is a critical challenge in deep learning. In this paper, we consider a realistic and challenging Test-Time Adaptation setting, where a model must continuously adapt to test samples that arrive sequentially, one at a time, while distinguishing between known and unknown classes. Current Test-Time Adaptation methods operate under closed-set assumptions or batch processing, differing from the real-world open-set scenarios. We address this limitation by establishing a comprehensive benchmark for {\em Open-set Single-image Test-Time Adaptation using Vision-Language Models}. Furthermore, we propose ROSITA, a novel framework that leverages dynamically updated feature banks to identify reliable test samples and employs a contrastive learning objective to improve the separation between known and unknown classes. Our approach effectively adapts models to domain shifts for known classes while rejecting unfamiliar samples. Extensive experiments across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that ROSITA sets a new state-of-the-art in open-set TTA, achieving both strong performance and computational efficiency for real-time deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in visual understanding and description, yet often suffer from hallucinations, attributing incorrect or misleading features to images. We observe that LVLMs disproportionately focus on a small subset of image tokens--termed blind tokens--which are typically irrelevant to the query (e.g., background or non-object regions). We hypothesize that such attention misalignment plays a key role in generating hallucinated responses. To mitigate this issue, we propose Attentional Vision Calibration (AvisC), a test-time approach that dynamically recalibrates the influence of blind tokens without modifying the underlying attention mechanism. AvisC first identifies blind tokens by analyzing layer-wise attention distributions over image tokens, then employs a contrastive decoding strategy to balance the influence of original and blind-token-biased logits. Experiments on standard benchmarks, including POPE, MME, and AMBER, demonstrate that AvisC effectively reduces hallucinations in LVLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based detectors have shown success in computer vision tasks with natural images. These models, exemplified by the Deformable DETR, are optimized through complex engineering strategies tailored to the typical characteristics of natural scenes. However, medical imaging data presents unique challenges such as extremely large image sizes, fewer and smaller regions of interest, and object classes which can be differentiated only through subtle differences. This study evaluates the applicability of these transformer-based design choices when applied to a screening mammography dataset that represents these distinct medical imaging data characteristics. Our analysis reveals that common design choices from the natural image domain, such as complex encoder architectures, multi-scale feature fusion, query initialization, and iterative bounding box refinement, do not improve and sometimes even impair object detection performance in medical imaging. In contrast, simpler and shallower architectures often achieve equal or superior results. This finding suggests that the adaptation of transformer models for medical imaging data requires a reevaluation of standard practices, potentially leading to more efficient and specialized frameworks for medical diagnosis.

  Gait recognition, a rapidly advancing vision technology for person identification from a distance, has made significant strides in indoor settings. However, evidence suggests that existing methods often yield unsatisfactory results when applied to newly released real-world gait datasets. Furthermore, conclusions drawn from indoor gait datasets may not easily generalize to outdoor ones. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive benchmark study aimed at improving practicality rather than solely focusing on enhancing performance. To this end, we developed OpenGait, a flexible and efficient gait recognition platform. Using OpenGait, we conducted in-depth ablation experiments to revisit recent developments in gait recognition. Surprisingly, we detected some imperfect parts of some prior methods and thereby uncovered several critical yet previously neglected insights. These findings led us to develop three structurally simple yet empirically powerful and practically robust baseline models: DeepGaitV2, SkeletonGait, and SkeletonGait++, which represent the appearance-based, model-based, and multi-modal methodologies for gait pattern description, respectively. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance, our careful exploration provides new perspectives on the modeling experience of deep gait models and the representational capacity of typical gait modalities. In the end, we discuss the key trends and challenges in current gait recognition, aiming to inspire further advancements towards better practicality. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Tiny machine learning (TinyML) for low-power devices lacks systematic methodologies for creating large, high-quality datasets suitable for production-grade systems. We present a novel automated pipeline for generating binary classification datasets that addresses this critical gap through several algorithmic innovations: intelligent multi-source label fusion, confidence-aware filtering, automated label correction, and systematic fine-grained benchmark generation. Crucially, automation is not merely convenient but necessary to cope with TinyML's diverse applications. TinyML requires bespoke datasets tailored to specific deployment constraints and use cases, making manual approaches prohibitively expensive and impractical for widespread adoption. Using our pipeline, we create Wake Vision, a large-scale binary classification dataset of almost 6 million images that demonstrates our methodology through person detection--the canonical vision task for TinyML. Wake Vision achieves up to a 6.6% accuracy improvement over existing datasets via a carefully designed two-stage training strategy and provides 100x more images. We demonstrate our broad applicability for automated large-scale TinyML dataset generation across two additional target categories, and show our label error rates are substantially lower than prior work. Our comprehensive fine-grained benchmark suite evaluates model robustness across five critical dimensions, revealing failure modes masked by aggregate metrics. To ensure continuous improvement, we establish ongoing community engagement through competitions hosted by the Edge AI Foundation. All datasets, benchmarks, and code are available under CC-BY 4.0 license, providing a systematic foundation for advancing TinyML research.

  We introduce ObjectAdd, a training-free diffusion modification method to add user-expected objects into user-specified area. The motive of ObjectAdd stems from: first, describing everything in one prompt can be difficult, and second, users often need to add objects into the generated image. To accommodate with real world, our ObjectAdd maintains accurate image consistency after adding objects with technical innovations in: (1) embedding-level concatenation to ensure correct text embedding coalesce; (2) object-driven layout control with latent and attention injection to ensure objects accessing user-specified area; (3) prompted image inpainting in an attention refocusing & object expansion fashion to ensure rest of the image stays the same. With a text-prompted image, our ObjectAdd allows users to specify a box and an object, and achieves: (1) adding object inside the box area; (2) exact content outside the box area; (3) flawless fusion between the two areas

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  FastCAR is a novel task consolidation approach in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for a classification and a regression task, despite task heterogeneity with only subtle correlation. It addresses object classification and continuous property variable regression, a crucial use case in science and engineering. FastCAR involves a labeling transformation approach that can be used with a single-task regression network architecture. FastCAR outperforms traditional MTL model families, parametrized in the landscape of architecture and loss weighting schemes, when learning of both tasks are collectively considered (classification accuracy of 99.54\%, regression mean absolute percentage error of 2.4\%). The experiments performed used an Advanced Steel Property datasetthis https URLcontributed by us. The dataset comprises 4536 images of 224x224 pixels, annotated with object classes and hardness properties that take continuous values. With our designed approach, FastCAR achieves reduced latency and time efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SemanticDraw, a new paradigm of interactive content creation where high-quality images are generated in near real-time from given multiple hand-drawn regions, each encoding prescribed semantic meaning. In order to maximize the productivity of content creators and to fully realize their artistic imagination, it requires both quick interactive interfaces and fine-grained regional controls in their tools. Despite astonishing generation quality from recent diffusion models, we find that existing approaches for regional controllability are very slow (52 seconds for $512 \times 512$ image) while not compatible with acceleration methods such as LCM, blocking their huge potential in interactive content creation. From this observation, we build our solution for interactive content creation in two steps: (1) we establish compatibility between region-based controls and acceleration techniques for diffusion models, maintaining high fidelity of multi-prompt image generation with $\times 10$ reduced number of inference steps, (2) we increase the generation throughput with our new multi-prompt stream batch pipeline, enabling low-latency generation from multiple, region-based text prompts on a single RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Our proposed framework is generalizable to any existing diffusion models and acceleration schedulers, allowing sub-second (0.64 seconds) image content creation application upon well-established image diffusion models.

  To enhance the interpretability of multimodal unified representations, many studies have focused on discrete unified representations. These efforts typically start with contrastive learning and gradually extend to the disentanglement of modal information, achieving solid multimodal discrete unified representations. However, existing research often overlooks two critical issues: 1) The use of Euclidean distance for quantization in discrete representations often overlooks the important distinctions among different dimensions of features, resulting in redundant representations after quantization; 2) Different modalities have unique characteristics, and a uniform alignment approach does not fully exploit these traits. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Optimization of Codebook (TOC) and Fine and Coarse cross-modal Information Disentangling (FCID). These methods refine the unified discrete representations from pretraining and perform fine- and coarse-grained information disentanglement tailored to the specific characteristics of each modality, achieving significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models.

  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are vital for modern image rendering due to their scalability and versatility. Previous SVG generation methods have focused on curve-based vectorization, lacking semantic understanding, often producing artifacts, and struggling with SVG primitives beyond path curves. To address these issues, we introduce StarVector, a multimodal large language model for SVG generation. It performs image vectorization by understanding image semantics and using SVG primitives for compact, precise outputs. Unlike traditional methods, StarVector works directly in the SVG code space, leveraging visual understanding to apply accurate SVG primitives. To train StarVector, we create SVG-Stack, a diverse dataset of 2M samples that enables generalization across vectorization tasks and precise use of primitives like ellipses, polygons, and text. We address challenges in SVG evaluation, showing that pixel-based metrics like MSE fail to capture the unique qualities of vector graphics. We introduce SVG-Bench, a benchmark across 10 datasets, and 3 tasks: Image-to-SVG, Text-to-SVG generation, and diagram generation. Using this setup, StarVector achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more compact and semantically rich SVGs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MoviePuzzle, a novel challenge that targets visual narrative reasoning and holistic movie understanding. Despite the notable progress that has been witnessed in the realm of video understanding, most prior works fail to present tasks and models to address holistic video understanding and the innate visual narrative structures existing in long-form videos. To tackle this quandary, we put forth MoviePuzzle task that amplifies the temporal feature learning and structure learning of video models by reshuffling the shot, frame, and clip layers of movie segments in the presence of video-dialogue information. We start by establishing a carefully refined dataset based on MovieNet by dissecting movies into hierarchical layers and randomly permuting the orders. Besides benchmarking the MoviePuzzle with prior arts on movie understanding, we devise a Hierarchical Contrastive Movie Clustering (HCMC) model that considers the underlying structure and visual semantic orders for movie reordering. Specifically, through a pairwise and contrastive learning approach, we train models to predict the correct order of each layer. This equips them with the knack for deciphering the visual narrative structure of movies and handling the disorder lurking in video data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the \MoviePuzzle benchmark, underscoring its efficacy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D medical image segmentation methods have been successful, but their dependence on large amounts of voxel-level annotated data is a disadvantage that needs to be addressed given the high cost to obtain such annotation. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) solve this issue by training models with a large unlabelled and a small labelled dataset. The most successful SSL approaches are based on consistency learning that minimises the distance between model responses obtained from perturbed views of the unlabelled data. These perturbations usually keep the spatial input context between views fairly consistent, which may cause the model to learn segmentation patterns from the spatial input contexts instead of the segmented objects. In this paper, we introduce the Translation Consistent Co-training (TraCoCo) which is a consistency learning SSL method that perturbs the input data views by varying their spatial input context, allowing the model to learn segmentation patterns from visual objects. Furthermore, we propose the replacement of the commonly used mean squared error (MSE) semi-supervised loss by a new Cross-model confident Binary Cross entropy (CBC) loss, which improves training convergence and keeps the robustness to co-training pseudo-labelling mistakes. We also extend CutMix augmentation to 3D SSL to further improve generalisation. Our TraCoCo shows state-of-the-art results for the Left Atrium (LA) and Brain Tumor Segmentation (BRaTS19) datasets with different backbones. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Training a robotic arm to accomplish real-world tasks has been attracting increasing attention in both academia and industry. This work discusses the role of computer vision algorithms in this field. We focus on low-cost arms on which no sensors are equipped and thus all decisions are made upon visual recognition, e.g., real-time 3D pose estimation. This requires annotating a lot of training data, which is not only time-consuming but also laborious.In this paper, we present an alternative solution, which uses a 3D model to create a large number of synthetic data, trains a vision model in this virtual domain, and applies it to real-world images after domain adaptation. To this end, we design a semi-supervised approach, which fully leverages the geometric constraints among keypoints. We apply an iterative algorithm for optimization. Without any annotations on real images, our algorithm generalizes well and produces satisfying results on 3D pose estimation, which is evaluated on two real-world datasets. We also construct a vision-based control system for task accomplishment, for which we train a reinforcement learning agent in a virtual environment and apply it to the real-world. Moreover, our approach, with merely a 3D model being required, has the potential to generalize to other types of multi-rigid-body dynamic systems. Website:this https URL. Code:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer based models have shown remarkable capabilities in sequence learning across a wide range of tasks, often performing well on specific task by leveraging input-output examples. Despite their empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this work, we investigate the layerwise behavior of Transformers to uncover the mechanisms underlying their multi-task generalization ability. Taking explorations on a typical sequence model, i.e, Hidden Markov Models, which are fundamental to many language tasks, we observe that: first, lower layers of Transformers focus on extracting feature representations, primarily influenced by neighboring tokens; second, on the upper layers, features become decoupled, exhibiting a high degree of time disentanglement. Building on these empirical insights, we provide theoretical analysis for the expressiveness power of Transformers. Our explicit constructions align closely with empirical observations, providing theoretical support for the Transformer's effectiveness and efficiency on sequence learning across diverse tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Early detection of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is critical for enabling timely clinical intervention and improving patient outcomes. In this work, we introduce CogniAlign, a multimodal architecture for Alzheimer's detection that integrates audio and textual modalities, two non-intrusive sources of information that offer complementary insights into cognitive health. Unlike prior approaches that fuse modalities at a coarse level, CogniAlign leverages a word-level temporal alignment strategy that synchronizes audio embeddings with corresponding textual tokens based on transcription timestamps. This alignment supports the development of token-level fusion techniques, enabling more precise cross-modal interactions. To fully exploit this alignment, we propose a Gated Cross-Attention Fusion mechanism, where audio features attend over textual representations, guided by the superior unimodal performance of the text modality. In addition, we incorporate prosodic cues, specifically interword pauses, by inserting pause tokens into the text and generating audio embeddings for silent intervals, further enriching both streams. We evaluate CogniAlign on the ADReSSo dataset, where it achieves an accuracy of 90.36%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. A detailed ablation study confirms the advantages of our alignment strategy, attention-based fusion, and prosodic modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we study the active sequential hypothesis testing problem, also known as pure exploration, where the goal is to actively control a data collection process to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis underlying a decision problem. While relevant across multiple domains, devising adaptive exploration strategies remains challenging, particularly due to difficulties in encoding appropriate inductive biases. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods often underperform when relevant information structures are inadequately represented, whereas more complex methods, like Best Arm Identification (BAI) techniques, may be difficult to devise and typically rely on explicit modeling assumptions. To address these limitations, we introduce In-Context Pure Exploration (ICPE), an in-context learning approach that uses Transformers to learn exploration strategies directly from experience. ICPE combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to identify and exploit latent structure across related tasks, without requiring prior assumptions. Numerical results across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks highlight ICPE's capability to achieve robust performance performance in deterministic, stochastic, and structured settings. These results demonstrate ICPE's ability to match optimal instance-dependent algorithms using only deep learning techniques, making it a practical and general approach to data-efficient exploration.

  Frugal Machine Learning (FML) refers to the practice of designing Machine Learning (ML) models that are efficient, cost-effective, and mindful of resource constraints. This field aims to achieve acceptable performance while minimizing the use of computational resources, time, energy, and data for both training and inference. FML strategies can be broadly categorized into input frugality, learning process frugality, and model frugality, each focusing on reducing resource consumption at different stages of the ML pipeline. This chapter explores recent advancements, applications, and open challenges in FML, emphasizing its importance for smart environments that incorporate edge computing and IoT devices, which often face strict limitations in bandwidth, energy, or latency. Technological enablers such as model compression, energy-efficient hardware, and data-efficient learning techniques are discussed, along with adaptive methods including parameter regularization, knowledge distillation, and dynamic architecture design that enable incremental model updates without full retraining. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive taxonomy of frugal methods, discusses case studies across diverse domains, and identifies future research directions to drive innovation in this evolving field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling laws have shaped recent advances in machine learning by enabling predictable scaling of model performance based on model size, computation, and data volume. Concurrently, the rise in computational cost for AI has motivated model compression techniques, notably quantization and sparsification, which have emerged to mitigate the steep computational demands associated with large-scale training and inference. This paper investigates the interplay between scaling laws and compression formats, exploring whether a unified scaling framework can accurately predict model performance when training occurs over various compressed representations, such as sparse, scalar-quantized, sparse-quantized or even vector-quantized formats. Our key contributions include validating a general scaling law formulation and showing that it is applicable both individually but also composably across compression types. Based on this, our main finding is demonstrating both theoretically and empirically that there exists a simple "capacity" metric -- based on the representation's ability to fit random Gaussian data -- which can robustly predict parameter efficiency across multiple compressed representations. On the practical side, we extend our formulation to directly compare the accuracy potential of different compressed formats, and to derive better algorithms for training over sparse-quantized formats.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets encode rich visual and linguistic knowledge, making them a strong foundation for robotics. Rather than training robotic policies from scratch, recent approaches adapt VLMs into vision-language-action (VLA) models that enable natural language-driven perception and control. However, existing VLAs are typically massive--often with billions of parameters--leading to high training costs and limited real-world deployability. Moreover, they rely on academic and industrial datasets, overlooking the growing availability of community-collected data from affordable robotic platforms. In this work, we present SmolVLA, a small, efficient, and community-driven VLA that drastically reduces both training and inference costs, while retaining competitive performance. SmolVLA is designed to be trained on a single GPU and deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or even CPUs. To further improve responsiveness, we introduce an asynchronous inference stack decoupling perception and action prediction from action execution, allowing higher control rates with chunked action generation. Despite its compact size, SmolVLA achieves performance comparable to VLAs that are 10x larger. We evaluate SmolVLA on a range of both simulated as well as real-world robotic benchmarks and release all code, pretrained models, and training data.

  _Subhadip Nandi, Neeraj Agrawal, Anshika Singh, Priyanka Bhatt_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Customer service chatbots are conversational systems aimed at addressing customer queries, often by directing them to automated workflows. A crucial aspect of this process is the classification of the customer's intent. Presently, most intent classification models for customer care utilise only customer query for intent prediction. This may result in low-accuracy models, which cannot handle ambiguous queries. An ambiguous query like "I didn't receive my package" could indicate a delayed order, or an order that was delivered but the customer failed to receive it. Resolution of each of these scenarios requires the execution of very different sequence of steps. Utilizing additional information, such as the customer's order delivery status, in the right manner can help identify the intent for such ambiguous queries. In this paper, we have introduced a context-aware NLU model that incorporates both, the customer query and contextual information from the customer's order status for predicting customer intent. A novel selective attention module is used to extract relevant context features. We have also proposed a multi-task learning paradigm for the effective utilization of different label types available in our training data. Our suggested method, Multi-Task Learning Contextual NLU with Selective Attention Weighted Context (MTL-CNLU-SAWC), yields a 4.8% increase in top 2 accuracy score over the baseline model which only uses user queries, and a 3.5% improvement over existing state-of-the-art models that combine query and context. We have deployed our model to production for Walmart's customer care domain. Accurate intent prediction through MTL-CNLU-SAWC helps to better direct customers to automated workflows, thereby significantly reducing escalations to human agents, leading to almost a million dollars in yearly savings for the company.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces FedGenGMM, a novel one-shot federated learning approach for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) tailored for unsupervised learning scenarios. In federated learning (FL), where multiple decentralized clients collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, significant challenges include statistical heterogeneity, high communication costs, and privacy concerns. FedGenGMM addresses these issues by allowing local GMM models, trained independently on client devices, to be aggregated through a single communication round. This approach leverages the generative property of GMMs, enabling the creation of a synthetic dataset on the server side to train a global model efficiently. Evaluation across diverse datasets covering image, tabular, and time series data demonstrates that FedGenGMM consistently achieves performance comparable to non-federated and iterative federated methods, even under significant data heterogeneity. Additionally, FedGenGMM significantly reduces communication overhead, maintains robust performance in anomaly detection tasks, and offers flexibility in local model complexities, making it particularly suitable for edge computing environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Unlearning (FU) enables clients to remove the influence of specific data from a collaboratively trained shared global model, addressing regulatory requirements such as GDPR and CCPA. However, this unlearning process introduces a new privacy risk: A malicious server may exploit unlearning updates to reconstruct the data requested for removal, a form of Data Reconstruction Attack (DRA). While DRAs for machine unlearning have been studied extensively in centralized Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) settings, their applicability to FU remains unclear due to the decentralized, client-driven nature of FU. This work presents DRAUN, the first attack framework to reconstruct unlearned data in FU systems. DRAUN targets optimization-based unlearning methods, which are widely adopted for their efficiency. We theoretically demonstrate why existing DRAs targeting machine unlearning in MLaaS fail in FU and show how DRAUN overcomes these limitations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on four datasets and four model architectures, evaluating its performance against five popular unlearning methods, effectively demonstrating that state-of-the-art FU methods remain vulnerable to DRAs.

  The problem of identifying geometric structure in data is a cornerstone of (unsupervised) learning. As a result, Geometric Representation Learning has been widely applied across scientific and engineering domains. In this work, we investigate the use of Geometric Representation Learning for the data-driven discovery of system dynamics from spatial-temporal data. We propose to encode similarity structure in such data in a spatial-temporal proximity graph, to which we apply a range of classical and deep learning-based manifold learning approaches to learn reduced order dynamics. We observe that while manifold learning is generally capable of recovering reduced order dynamics, the quality of the learned representations varies substantially across different algorithms and hyperparameter choices. This is indicative of high sensitivity to the inherent geometric assumptions of the respective approaches and suggests a need for careful hyperparameter tuning, which can be expensive in practise. To overcome these challenges, we propose a framework for Automated Manifold Learning, which selects a manifold learning approach and corresponding hyperparameter choices based on representative subsamples of the input graph. We demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to performance gains both in scalability and in the learned representations' accuracy in capturing local and global geometric features of the underlying system dynamics.

  Linear and quadratic optimization are crucial in numerous real-world applications, from training machine learning models to integer-linear optimization. Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, requiring solving many such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive learning, thereby pretraining MPNNs for enhanced performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the advancement of diffusion models, there is a growing demand for high-quality, controllable image generation, particularly through methods that utilize one or multiple control signals based on ControlNet. However, in current ControlNet training, each control is designed to influence all areas of an image, which can lead to conflicts when different control signals are expected to manage different parts of the image in practical applications. This issue is especially pronounced with edge-type control conditions, where regions lacking boundary information often represent low-frequency signals, referred to as silent control signals. When combining multiple ControlNets, these silent control signals can suppress the generation of textures in related areas, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this problem, we propose Minimal Impact ControlNet. Our approach mitigates conflicts through three key strategies: constructing a balanced dataset, combining and injecting feature signals in a balanced manner, and addressing the asymmetry in the score function's Jacobian matrix induced by ControlNet. These improvements enhance the compatibility of control signals, allowing for freer and more harmonious generation in areas with silent control signals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical applications requires safety guarantees. Provably safe reinforcement learning is an active field of research which aims to provide such guarantees using safeguards. These safeguards should be integrated during training to prevent a large sim-to-real gap. While there are several approaches for safeguarding sampling-based reinforcement learning, analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning often achieves superior performance and sample efficiency. However, there is no safeguarding approach for this learning paradigm yet. Our work addresses this gap by developing the first effective safeguard for analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning. We analyse existing, differentiable safeguards, adapt them through modified mappings and gradient formulations, and integrate them with a state-of-the-art learning algorithm and a differentiable simulation. We evaluate how different safeguards affect policy optimisation using numerical experiments on two classical control tasks. The results demonstrate safeguarded training without compromising performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, a state-of-the-art method in maximum entropy reinforcement learning, traditionally relies on minimizing reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for policy updates. However, this approach leads to an intractable optimal projection policy, necessitating gradient-based approximations that can suffer from instability and poor sample efficiency. This paper investigates the alternative use of forward KL divergence within SAC. We demonstrate that for Gaussian policies, forward KL divergence yields an explicit optimal projection policy -- corresponding to the mean and variance of the target Boltzmann distribution's action marginals. Building on the distinct advantages of both KL directions, we propose Bidirectional SAC, an algorithm that first initializes the policy using the explicit forward KL projection and then refines it by optimizing the reverse KL divergence. Comprehensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks show that Bidirectional SAC significantly outperforms standard SAC and other baselines, achieving up to a $30\%$ increase in episodic rewards, alongside enhanced sample efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the problem of Gaussian Process (GP) optimization in the presence of unknown and potentially varying adversarial perturbations. Unlike traditional robust optimization approaches that focus on maximizing performance under worst-case scenarios, we consider a robust satisficing objective, where the goal is to consistently achieve a predefined performance threshold $\tau$, even under adversarial conditions. We propose two novel algorithms based on distinct formulations of robust satisficing, and show that they are instances of a general robust satisficing framework. Further, each algorithm offers different guarantees depending on the nature of the adversary. Specifically, we derive two regret bounds: one that is sublinear over time, assuming certain conditions on the adversary and the satisficing threshold $\tau$, and another that scales with the perturbation magnitude but requires no assumptions on the adversary. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the established robust optimization methods in achieving the satisficing objective, particularly when the ambiguity set of the robust optimization framework is inaccurately specified.

  _Hamid Attar, Luigi Lunardon, Alessio Pagani_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) approach for scalability of UTXO-based blockchains, such as Bitcoin. Prior approaches to UTXO set sharding struggle with distributing UTXOs effectively across validators, creating substantial communication overhead due to child-parent transaction dependencies. This overhead, which arises from the need to locate parent UTXOs, significantly hampers transaction processing speeds. Our solution uses ML to optimize not only UTXO set sharding but also the routing of incoming transactions, ensuring that transactions are directed to shards containing their parent UTXOs. At the heart of our approach is a framework that combines contrastive and unsupervised learning to create an embedding space for transaction outputs. This embedding allows the model to group transaction outputs based on spending relationships, making it possible to route transactions efficiently to the correct validation microservices. Trained on historical transaction data with triplet loss and online semi-hard negative mining, the model embeds parent-child spending patterns directly into its parameters, thus eliminating the need for costly, real-time parent transaction lookups.

  Neural models learn representations of high-dimensional data on low-dimensional manifolds. Multiple factors, including stochasticities in the training process, model architectures, and additional inductive biases, may induce different representations, even when learning the same task on the same data. However, it has recently been shown that when a latent structure is shared between distinct latent spaces, relative distances between representations can be preserved, up to distortions. Building on this idea, we demonstrate that exploiting the differential-geometric structure of latent spaces of neural models, it is possible to capture precisely the transformations between representational spaces trained on similar data distributions. Specifically, we assume that distinct neural models parametrize approximately the same underlying manifold, and introduce a representation based on the pullback metric that captures the intrinsic structure of the latent space, while scaling efficiently to large models. We validate experimentally our method on model stitching and retrieval tasks, covering autoencoders and vision foundation discriminative models, across diverse architectures, datasets, and pretraining schemes.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) policies represented in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) offer powerful representational capabilities. While second-order optimization methods like Newton's method demonstrate faster convergence than first-order approaches, current RKHS-based policy optimization remains constrained to first-order techniques. This limitation stems primarily from the intractability of explicitly computing and inverting the infinite-dimensional Hessian operator in RKHS. We introduce Policy Newton in RKHS, the first second-order optimization framework specifically designed for RL policies represented in RKHS. Our approach circumvents direct computation of the inverse Hessian operator by optimizing a cubic regularized auxiliary objective function. Crucially, we leverage the Representer Theorem to transform this infinite-dimensional optimization into an equivalent, computationally tractable finite-dimensional problem whose dimensionality scales with the trajectory data volume. We establish theoretical guarantees proving convergence to a local optimum with a local quadratic convergence rate. Empirical evaluations on a toy financial asset allocation problem validate these theoretical properties, while experiments on standard RL benchmarks demonstrate that Policy Newton in RKHS achieves superior convergence speed and higher episodic rewards compared to established first-order RKHS approaches and parametric second-order methods. Our work bridges a critical gap between non-parametric policy representations and second-order optimization methods in reinforcement learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Temporal graph learning has applications in recommendation systems, traffic forecasting, and social network analysis. Although multiple architectures have been introduced, progress in positional encoding for temporal graphs remains limited. Extending static Laplacian eigenvector approaches to temporal graphs through the supra-Laplacian has shown promise, but also poses key challenges: high eigendecomposition costs, limited theoretical understanding, and ambiguity about when and how to apply these encodings. In this paper, we address these issues by (1) offering a theoretical framework that connects supra-Laplacian encodings to per-time-slice encodings, highlighting the benefits of leveraging additional temporal connectivity, (2) introducing novel methods to reduce the computational overhead, achieving up to 56x faster runtimes while scaling to graphs with 50,000 active nodes, and (3) conducting an extensive experimental study to identify which models, tasks, and datasets benefit most from these encodings. Our findings reveal that while positional encodings can significantly boost performance in certain scenarios, their effectiveness varies across different models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Being able to solve a task in diverse ways makes agents more robust to task variations and less prone to local optima. In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Algorithm selection is commonly used to predict the best solver from a portfolio per per-instance. In many real scenarios, instances arrive in a stream: new instances become available over time, while the number of class labels can also grow as new data distributions arrive downstream. As a result, the classification model needs to be periodically updated to reflect additional solvers without catastrophic forgetting of past data. In machine-learning (ML), this is referred to as Class Incremental Learning (CIL). While commonly addressed in ML settings, its relevance to algorithm-selection in optimisation has not been previously studied. Using a bin-packing dataset, we benchmark 8 continual learning methods with respect to their ability to withstand catastrophic forgetting. We find that rehearsal-based methods significantly outperform other CIL methods. While there is evidence of forgetting, the loss is small at around 7%. Hence, these methods appear to be a viable approach to continual learning in streaming optimisation scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Temporal Variational Implicit Neural Representations (TV-INRs), a probabilistic framework for modeling irregular multivariate time series that enables efficient individualized imputation and forecasting. By integrating implicit neural representations with latent variable models, TV-INRs learn distributions over time-continuous generator functions conditioned on signal-specific covariates. Unlike existing approaches that require extensive training, fine-tuning or meta-learning, our method achieves accurate individualized predictions through a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single TV-INRs instance, we can accurately solve diverse imputation and forecasting tasks, offering a computationally efficient and scalable solution for real-world applications. TV-INRs excel especially in low-data regimes, where it outperforms existing methods by an order of magnitude in mean squared error for imputation task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In medicine, treatments often influence multiple, interdependent outcomes, such as primary endpoints, complications, adverse events, or other secondary endpoints. Hence, to make optimal treatment decisions, clinicians are interested in learning the distribution of multi-dimensional treatment outcomes. However, the vast majority of machine learning methods for predicting treatment effects focus on single-outcome settings, despite the fact that medical data often include multiple, interdependent outcomes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based method called DIME to learn the joint distribution of multiple outcomes of medical treatments. We addresses three challenges relevant in medical practice: (i)it is tailored to learn the joint interventional distribution of multiple medical outcomes, which enables reliable decision-making with uncertainty quantification rather than relying solely on point estimates; (ii)it explicitly captures the dependence structure between outcomes; (iii)it can handle outcomes of mixed type, including binary, categorical, and continuous variables. In DIME, we take into account the fundamental problem of causal inference through causal masking. For training, our method decomposes the joint distribution into a series of conditional distributions with a customized conditional masking to account for the dependence structure across outcomes. For inference, our method auto-regressively generates predictions. This allows our method to move beyond point estimates of causal quantities and thus learn the joint interventional distribution. To the best of our knowledge, DIME is the first neural method tailored to learn the joint, multi-outcome distribution of medical treatments. Across various experiments, we demonstrate that our method effectively learns the joint distribution and captures shared information among multiple outcomes.

  Learning meaningful abstract models of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is crucial for improving generalization from limited data. In this work, we show how geometric priors can be imposed on the low-dimensional representation manifold of a learned transition model. We incorporate known symmetric structures via appropriate choices of the latent space and the associated group actions, which encode prior knowledge about invariances in the environment. In addition, our framework allows the embedding of additional unstructured information alongside these symmetries. We show experimentally that this leads to better predictions of the latent transition model than fully unstructured approaches, as well as better learning on downstream RL tasks, in environments with rotational and translational features, including in first-person views of 3D environments. Additionally, our experiments show that this leads to simpler and more disentangled representations. The full code is available on GitHub to ensure reproducibility.

  With the rise of large pre-trained foundation models for automatic speech recognition new challenges appear. While the performance of these models is good, runtime and cost of inference increases. One approach to make use of their strength while retaining efficiency is to distill their knowledge to smaller models during training. In this work, we explore different CTC-based distillation variants, focusing on blank token handling. We show that common approaches like blank elimination do not always work off the shelf. We explore new blank selection patterns as a potential sweet spot between standard knowledge distillation and blank elimination mechanisms. Through the introduction of a symmetric selection method, we are able to remove the CTC loss during knowledge distillation with minimal to no performance degradation. With this, we make the training independent from target labels, potentially allowing for distillation on untranscribed audio data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human sentiment through multimodal data. In real-world scenarios, practical factors often lead to uncertain modality missingness. Existing methods for handling modality missingness are based on data reconstruction or common subspace projections. However, these methods neglect the confidence in multimodal combinations and impose constraints on intra-class representation, hindering the capture of modality-specific information and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that effectively incorporates multimodal probabilistic embeddings via a mixture of Student's $t$-distributions, enhancing its robustness by incorporating confidence and accommodating heavy-tailed properties. This strategy estimates joint distributions with uncertainty scores and reduces uncertainty in the student network by consistency distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a reparameterization representation module that facilitates CASD in robust multimodal learning by sampling embeddings from the joint distribution for the prediction module to calculate the task loss. As a result, the directional constraint from the loss minimization is alleviated by the sampled representation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  Data imbalance persists as a pervasive challenge in regression tasks, introducing bias in model performance and undermining predictive reliability. This is particularly detrimental in applications aimed at predicting rare events that fall outside the domain of the bulk of the training data. In this study, we review the current state-of-the-art regarding sampling-based methods and cost-sensitive learning. Additionally, we propose novel approaches to mitigate model bias. To better asses the importance of data, we introduce the density-distance and density-ratio relevance functions, which effectively integrate empirical frequency of data with domain-specific preferences, offering enhanced interpretability for end-users. Furthermore, we present advanced mitigation techniques (cSMOGN and crbSMOGN), which build upon and improve existing sampling methods. In a comprehensive quantitative evaluation, we benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 10 synthetic and 42 real-world datasets, using neural networks, XGBoosting trees and Random Forest models. Our analysis reveals that while most strategies improve performance on rare samples, they often degrade it on frequent ones. We demonstrate that constructing an ensemble of models -- one trained with imbalance mitigation and another without -- can significantly reduce these negative effects. The key findings underscore the superior performance of our novel crbSMOGN sampling technique with the density-ratio relevance function for neural networks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

  _Manuel Franco de la Pe√±a, √Ångel Luis Perales G√≥mez, Lorenzo Fern√°ndez Maim√≥_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Industrial Internet of Things environments increasingly rely on advanced Anomaly Detection and explanation techniques to rapidly detect and mitigate cyberincidents, thereby ensuring operational safety. The sequential nature of data collected from these environments has enabled improvements in Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by processing time windows rather than treating the data as tabular. However, conventional explanation methods often neglect this temporal structure, leading to imprecise or less actionable explanations. This work presents ShaTS (Shapley values for Time Series models), which is a model-agnostic explainable Artificial Intelligence method designed to enhance the precision of Shapley value explanations for time series models. ShaTS addresses the shortcomings of traditional approaches by incorporating an a priori feature grouping strategy that preserves temporal dependencies and produces both coherent and actionable insights. Experiments conducted on the SWaT dataset demonstrate that ShaTS accurately identifies critical time instants, precisely pinpoints the sensors, actuators, and processes affected by anomalies, and outperforms SHAP in terms of both explainability and resource efficiency, fulfilling the real-time requirements of industrial environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation, we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset, detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) is crucial for drug discovery and repositioning, as it reveals potential uses of existing drugs, aiding in the acceleration of the drug development process and reducing associated costs. Despite the similarity information in DTI is important, most models are limited to mining direct similarity information within homogeneous graphs, overlooking the potential yet rich similarity information in heterogeneous graphs. Inspired by real-world social interaction behaviors, we propose SOC-DGL, which comprises two specialized modules: the Affinity-Driven Graph Learning (ADGL) module and the Equilibrium-Driven Graph Learning (EDGL) module. The ADGL module adopts a comprehensive social interaction strategy, leveraging an affinity-enhanced global drug-target graph to learn both global DTI and the individual similarity information of drugs and targets. In contrast, the EDGL module employs a higher-order social interaction strategy, amplifying the influence of even-hop neighbors through an even-polynomial graph filter grounded in balance theory, enabling the indirect mining of higher-order homogeneous information. This dual approach enables SOC-DGL to effectively and comprehensively capture similarity information across diverse interaction scales within the affinity matrices and drug-target association matrices, significantly enhancing the model's generalization capability and predictive accuracy in DTI tasks. To address the issue of imbalance in drug-target interaction datasets, this paper proposes an adjustable imbalance loss function that mitigates the impact of sample imbalance by adjusting the weight of negative samples and a parameter. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate significant accuracy improvements achieved by SOC-DGL, particularly in scenarios involving data imbalance and unseen drugs or targets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model editing has become an important tool for addressing privacy, bias, and misinformation in large language models (LLMs) by enabling updates to knowledge without the need for retraining from scratch. However, existing editing techniques often target isolated facts, ignoring ripple effects on related knowledge, allowing edited facts to remain deducible and compromising broader contextual integrity. For example, changing Harry Potter's school from Hogwarts to Ilvermorny requires reassigning his house from Gryffindor to a suitable alternative while preserving Gryffindor's relationship with Hogwarts. In this work, we present a new model-editing setting, deep editing, to show: (1) how editing techniques fail to handle connected facts, evaluating how original knowledge sneaks through unchanged causal links, and (2) their impact on broader contextual knowledge. We introduce ThinkEval, a framework to systematically evaluate model- editing techniques by building model-specific knowledge graphs to analyze pre- and post-edit effects on fact persistence and catastrophic forgetting. We present KnowGIC, a benchmark created with ThinkEval, consisting of sequentially linked queries to measure these effects. We evaluate five editing techniques: AlphaEdit, RECT, ROME, MEMIT, and PRUNE across multiple LLMs. We find that these techniques struggle to balance indirect fact suppression with the preservation of related knowledge.

  Understanding the various properties of glycans with machine learning has shown some preliminary promise. However, previous methods mainly focused on modeling the backbone structure of glycans as graphs of monosaccharides (i.e., sugar units), while they neglected the atomic structures underlying each monosaccharide, which are actually important indicators of glycan properties. We fill this blank by introducing the GlycanAA model for All-Atom-wise Glycan modeling. GlycanAA models a glycan as a heterogeneous graph with monosaccharide nodes representing its global backbone structure and atom nodes representing its local atomic-level structures. Based on such a graph, GlycanAA performs hierarchical message passing to capture from local atomic-level interactions to global monosaccharide-level interactions. To further enhance model capability, we pre-train GlycanAA on a high-quality unlabeled glycan dataset, deriving the PreGlycanAA model. We design a multi-scale mask prediction algorithm to endow the model about different levels of dependencies in a glycan. Extensive benchmark results show the superiority of GlycanAA over existing glycan encoders and verify the further improvements achieved by PreGlycanAA. We maintain all resources atthis https URL

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks through both post-training and test-time scaling laws. While prevalent test-time scaling approaches are often realized by using external reward models to guide the model generation process, we find only marginal gains can be acquired when scaling a model post-trained on specific reasoning tasks. We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution discrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general reward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to self-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification within a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model can further scale its performance during inference time by verifying its generations, without the need for external verifiers. We train our self-verification models based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, demonstrating its capabilities across varying reasoning context lengths. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our models can not only improve post-training performance but also enable effective test-time scaling.

  Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.

  Relational databases (RDBs) are composed of interconnected tables, where relationships between them are defined through foreign keys. Recent research on applying machine learning to RDBs has explored graph-based representations of RDBs, where rows of tables are modeled as nodes, and foreign key relationships are modeled as edges. RDB-to-graph modeling helps capture cross-table dependencies, ultimately leading to enhanced performance across diverse tasks. However, there are numerous ways to model RDBs as graphs, and performance varies significantly depending on the chosen graph model. In our analysis, applying a common heuristic rule for graph modeling leads to up to a 10% drop in performance compared to the best-performing graph model, which remains non-trivial to identify. To foster research on intelligent RDB-to-graph modeling, we introduce RDB2G-Bench, the first benchmark framework for evaluating such methods. We construct extensive datasets covering 5 real-world RDBs and 12 predictive tasks, resulting in around 50k graph-performance pairs for efficient and reproducible evaluations. Thanks to our precomputed datasets, we were able to benchmark 9 automatic RDB-to-graph modeling methods on the 12 tasks over 600x faster than on-the-fly evaluation, which requires repeated model training. Our analysis of the datasets and benchmark results reveals key structural patterns affecting graph model effectiveness, along with practical implications for effective graph modeling.

  Decentralized training of large language models offers the opportunity to pool computational resources across geographically distributed participants but faces significant network communication bottlenecks, particularly in pipeline-parallel settings. While pipeline parallelism partitions model layers across devices to handle large-scale models, it necessitates frequent communication of intermediate activations, creating challenges when network bandwidth is limited. Existing activation compression methods, such as AQ-SGD, mitigate quantization-induced errors through error compensation but impose prohibitive memory overhead by requiring storage of previous activations. To address these issues, we introduce TAH-Quant (Tile-wise Adaptive Hadamard Quantization), a novel activation quantization framework designed specifically for pipeline parallelism. Our approach integrates fine-grained tile-wise quantization for precise control, entropy-guided token-level adaptive bit allocation for optimal bit usage, and a Hadamard-based transform with pivot element swapping to effectively suppress quantization outliers. We further provide a theoretical analysis, proving that pipeline parallel training equipped with TAH-Quant maintains a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, matching that of vanilla stochastic gradient descent. Extensive experiments on diverse LLM tasks demonstrate that TAH-Quant achieves aggressive activation quantization (3-4 bits) ratio, which provides up to 4.3$\times$ end-to-end speedup without compromising training convergence, matches state-of-the-art methods, incurs no extra memory overhead, and generalizes well across different training scenarios.

  This paper proposes a novel stable learning theory for recurrent neural networks (RNNs), so-called variational adaptive noise and dropout (VAND). As stabilizing factors for RNNs, noise and dropout on the internal state of RNNs have been separately confirmed in previous studies. We reinterpret the optimization problem of RNNs as variational inference, showing that noise and dropout can be derived simultaneously by transforming the explicit regularization term arising in the optimization problem into implicit regularization. Their scale and ratio can also be adjusted appropriately to optimize the main objective of RNNs, respectively. In an imitation learning scenario with a mobile manipulator, only VAND is able to imitate sequential and periodic behaviors as instructed.this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning offers a promising solution to privacy and safety concerns in large language models (LLMs) by selectively removing targeted knowledge while preserving utility. However, current methods are highly sensitive to downstream fine-tuning, which can quickly recover forgotten information-even from unrelated tasks. To address this, we introduce invariance into unlearning for the first time, inspired by invariant risk minimization (IRM). Building on this principle, we propose invariant LLM unlearning (ILU), a regularization-based framework that enhances robustness. Notably, ILU generalizes well to diverse fine-tuning tasks, even when trained using a single dataset. A task vector analysis is also provided to further elucidate the rationale behind ILU's effectiveness. Extensive experiments on the WMDP and MUSE benchmark, reveal that ILU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods, including negative preference optimization (NPO) and representation misdirection for unlearning (RMU). Notably, ILU achieves superior unlearning robustness across diverse downstream fine-tuning scenarios (e.g., math, paraphrase detection, and sentiment analysis) while preserving the fine-tuning performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks, creating data samples by progressively denoising an initial random state. Traditionally, this initial state is sampled from a simple, fixed distribution like isotropic Gaussian, inherently lacking structure and a direct mechanism for external control. While recent efforts have explored ways to introduce controllability into the diffusion process, particularly at the initialization stage, they often rely on deterministic or heuristic approaches. These methods can be suboptimal, lack expressiveness, and are difficult to scale or integrate into more sophisticated optimization frameworks. In this paper, we introduce NoiseAR, a novel method for AutoRegressive Initial Noise Prior for Diffusion Models. Instead of a static, unstructured source, NoiseAR learns to generate a dynamic and controllable prior distribution for the initial noise. We formulate the generation of the initial noise prior's parameters as an autoregressive probabilistic modeling task over spatial patches or tokens. This approach enables NoiseAR to capture complex spatial dependencies and introduce learned structure into the initial state. Crucially, NoiseAR is designed to be conditional, allowing text prompts to directly influence the learned prior, thereby achieving fine-grained control over the diffusion initialization. Our experiments demonstrate that NoiseAR can generate initial noise priors that lead to improved sample quality and enhanced consistency with conditional inputs, offering a powerful, learned alternative to traditional random initialization. A key advantage of NoiseAR is its probabilistic formulation, which naturally supports seamless integration into probabilistic frameworks like Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning.

  Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.

  _Taehoon Yoon, Yunhong Min, Kyeongmin Yeo, Minhyuk Sung_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning (MU) aims to expunge a designated forget set from a trained model without costly retraining, yet the existing techniques overlook two critical blind spots: "over-unlearning" that deteriorates retained data near the forget set, and post-hoc "relearning" attacks that aim to resurrect the forgotten knowledge. We first derive the over-unlearning metric OU@{\epsilon}, which represents the collateral damage to the nearby region of the forget set, where the over-unlearning mainly appears. Next, we expose an unforeseen relearning threat on MU, i.e., the Prototypical Relearning Attack, which exploits the per-class prototype of the forget class with just a few samples, and easily restores the pre-unlearning performance. To counter both blind spots, we introduce Spotter, a plug-and-play objective that combines (i) a masked knowledge-distillation penalty on the nearby region of forget set to suppress OU@{\epsilon}, and (ii) an intra-class dispersion loss that scatters forget-class embeddings, neutralizing prototypical relearning attacks. On CIFAR-10, as one of validations, Spotter reduces OU@{\epsilon}by below the 0.05X of the baseline, drives forget accuracy to 0%, preserves accuracy of the retain set within 1% of difference with the original, and denies the prototype-attack by keeping the forget set accuracy within <1%, without accessing retained data. It confirms that Spotter is a practical remedy of the unlearning's blind spots.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction tuning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively follow user instructions. To improve training efficiency and reduce data redundancy, recent works use LLM-based scoring functions, e.g., Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD), to select high-quality instruction-tuning data with scores above a threshold. While these data selection methods often lead to models that can match or even exceed the performance of models trained on the full datasets, we identify two key limitations: (i) they assess quality at the sample level, ignoring token-level informativeness; and (ii) they overlook the robustness of the scoring method, often selecting a sample due to superficial lexical features instead of its true quality. In this work, we propose Token-Selective HIeRarchical Data Selection for Instruction Tuning (T-SHIRT), a novel data selection framework that introduces a new scoring method to include only informative tokens in quality evaluation and also promotes robust and reliable samples whose neighbors also show high quality with less local inconsistencies. We demonstrate that models instruction-tuned on a curated dataset (only 5% of the original size) using T-SHIRT can outperform those trained on the entire large-scale dataset by up to 5.48 points on average across eight benchmarks. Across various LLMs and training set scales, our method consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art data selection techniques, while also remaining both cost-effective and highly efficient. For instance, by using GPT-2 for score computation, we are able to process a dataset of 52k samples using 40 minutes on a single GPU.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Increasingly complex neural network architectures have achieved phenomenal performance. However, these complex models require massive computational resources that consume substantial amounts of electricity, which highlights the potential environmental impact of such models. Previous studies have demonstrated that substantial redundancies exist in large pre-trained models. However, previous work has primarily focused on compressing models while retaining comparable model performance, and the direct impact on electricity consumption appears to have received relatively little attention. By quantifying the energy usage associated with both uncompressed and compressed models, we investigate compression as a means of reducing electricity consumption. We consider nine different pre-trained models, ranging in size from 8M parameters to 138M parameters. To establish a baseline, we first train each model without compression and record the electricity usage and time required during training, along with other relevant statistics. We then apply three compression techniques: Steganographic capacity reduction, pruning, and low-rank factorization. In each of the resulting cases, we again measure the electricity usage, training time, model accuracy, and so on. We find that pruning and low-rank factorization offer no significant improvements with respect to energy usage or other related statistics, while steganographic capacity reduction provides major benefits in almost every case. We discuss the significance of these findings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-quality time series (TS) data are essential for ensuring TS model performance, rendering research on rating TS data quality indispensable. Existing methods have shown promising rating accuracy within individual domains, primarily by extending data quality rating techniques such as influence functions and Shapley values to account for temporal characteristics. However, they neglect the fact that real-world TS data can span vastly different domains and exhibit distinct properties, hampering the accurate and efficient rating of diverse TS data. In this paper, we propose TSRating, a novel and unified framework for rating the quality of time series data crawled from diverse domains. TSRating is built on the assumption that LLMs inherit ample knowledge, acquired during their extensive pretraining, enabling them to comprehend and discern quality differences in diverse TS data. We verify this assumption by devising a series of prompts to elicit quality comparisons from LLMs for pairs of TS samples. We then fit a dedicated rating model, termed TSRater, to convert the LLMs' judgments into efficient quality predictions via TSRater's inference on future TS samples. To ensure cross-domain adaptability, we develop a meta-learning scheme to train TSRater on quality comparisons collected from nine distinct domains. To improve training efficiency, we employ signSGD for inner-loop updates, thus circumventing the demanding computation of hypergradients. Extensive experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets across three time series tasks, each using both conventional TS models and TS foundation models, demonstrate that TSRating outperforms baselines in terms of estimation accuracy, efficiency, and domain adaptability.

  _Zhijie Xie, Shenghui Song_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the context of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), applying Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) faces challenges related to the update order of its actor and critic due to the aggregation step occurring between successive iterations. In particular, when local actors are updated based on local critic estimations, the algorithm becomes vulnerable to data heterogeneity. As a result, the conventional update order in PPO (critic first, then actor) may cause heterogeneous gradient directions among clients, hindering convergence to a globally optimal policy. To address this issue, we propose FedRAC, which reverses the update order (actor first, then critic) to eliminate the divergence of critics from different clients. Theoretical analysis shows that the convergence bound of FedRAC is immune to data heterogeneity under mild conditions, i.e., bounded level of heterogeneity and accurate policy evaluation. Empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains higher cumulative rewards and converges more rapidly in five experiments, including three classical RL environments and a highly heterogeneous autonomous driving scenario using the SUMO traffic simulator.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling models has led to significant advancements in deep learning, but training these models in decentralized settings remains challenging due to communication bottlenecks. While existing compression techniques are effective in data-parallel, they do not extend to model parallelism. Unlike data-parallel training, where weight gradients are exchanged, model-parallel requires compressing activations and activation gradients as they propagate through layers, accumulating compression errors. We propose a novel compression algorithm that compresses both forward and backward passes, enabling up to 99% compression with no convergence degradation with negligible memory/compute overhead. By leveraging a recursive structure in transformer networks, we predefine a low-dimensional subspace to confine the activations and gradients, allowing full reconstruction in subsequent layers. Our method achieves up to 100x improvement in communication efficiency and enables training billion-parameter-scale models over low-end GPUs connected via consumer-grade internet speeds as low as 80Mbps, matching the convergence of centralized datacenter systems with 100Gbps connections with model parallel.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structured data-quality issues, such as missing values correlated with demographics, culturally biased labels, or systemic selection biases, routinely degrade the reliability of machine-learning pipelines. Regulators now increasingly demand evidence that high-stakes systems can withstand these realistic, interdependent errors, yet current robustness evaluations typically use random or overly simplistic corruptions, leaving worst-case scenarios unexplored. We introduce SAVAGE, a causally inspired framework that (i) formally models realistic data-quality issues through dependency graphs and flexible corruption templates, and (ii) systematically discovers corruption patterns that maximally degrade a target performance metric. SAVAGE employs a bi-level optimization approach to efficiently identify vulnerable data subpopulations and fine-tune corruption severity, treating the full ML pipeline, including preprocessing and potentially non-differentiable models, as a black box. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and ML tasks (data cleaning, fairness-aware learning, uncertainty quantification) demonstrate that even a small fraction (around 5 %) of structured corruptions identified by SAVAGE severely impacts model performance, far exceeding random or manually crafted errors, and invalidating core assumptions of existing techniques. Thus, SAVAGE provides a practical tool for rigorous pipeline stress-testing, a benchmark for evaluating robustness methods, and actionable guidance for designing more resilient data workflows.

  Density Functional Theory (DFT) allows for predicting all the chemical and physical properties of molecular systems from first principles by finding an approximate solution to the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation. However, the cost of these predictions becomes infeasible when increasing the scale of the energy evaluations, e.g., when calculating the ground-state energy for simulating molecular dynamics. Recent works have demonstrated that, for substantially large datasets of molecular conformations, Deep Learning-based models can predict the outputs of the classical DFT solvers by amortizing the corresponding optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel method that reduces the dependency of amortized DFT solvers on large pre-collected datasets by introducing a self-refining training strategy. Namely, we propose an efficient method that simultaneously trains a deep-learning model to predict the DFT outputs and samples molecular conformations that are used as training data for the model. We derive our method as a minimization of the variational upper bound on the KL-divergence measuring the discrepancy between the generated samples and the target Boltzmann distribution defined by the ground state energy. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed scheme, we perform an extensive empirical study comparing it with the models trained on the pre-collected datasets. Finally, we open-source our implementation of the proposed algorithm, optimized with asynchronous training and sampling stages, which enables simultaneous sampling and training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting structural change in dynamic network data has wide-ranging applications. Existing approaches typically divide the data into time bins, extract network features within each bin, and then compare these features over time. This introduces an inherent tradeoff between temporal resolution and the statistical stability of the extracted features. Despite this tradeoff, reminiscent of time-frequency tradeoffs in signal processing, most methods rely on a fixed temporal resolution. Choosing an appropriate resolution parameter is typically difficult and can be especially problematic in domains like cybersecurity, where anomalous behavior may emerge at multiple time scales. We address this challenge by proposing ANIE (Adaptive Network Intensity Estimation), a multi-resolution framework designed to automatically identify the time scales at which network structure evolves, enabling the joint detection of both rapid and gradual changes. Modeling interactions as Poisson processes, our method proceeds in two steps: (1) estimating a low-dimensional subspace of node behavior, and (2) deriving a set of novel empirical affinity coefficients that quantify change in interaction intensity between latent factors and support statistical testing for structural change across time scales. We provide theoretical guarantees for subspace estimation and the asymptotic behavior of the affinity coefficients, enabling model-based change detection. Experiments on synthetic networks show that ANIE adapts to the appropriate time resolution and is able to capture sharp structural changes while remaining robust to noise. Furthermore, applications to real-world data showcase the practical benefits of ANIE's multiresolution approach to detecting structural change over fixed resolution methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To ensure learned controllers comply with safety and reliability requirements for reinforcement learning in real-world settings remains challenging. Traditional safety assurance approaches, such as state avoidance and constrained Markov decision processes, often inadequately capture trajectory requirements or may result in overly conservative behaviors. To address these limitations, recent studies advocate the use of formal specification languages such as linear temporal logic (LTL), enabling the derivation of correct-by-construction learning objectives from the specified requirements. However, the sparse rewards associated with LTL specifications make learning extremely difficult, whereas dense heuristic-based rewards risk compromising correctness. In this work, we propose the first method, to our knowledge, that integrates LTL with differentiable simulators, facilitating efficient gradient-based learning directly from LTL specifications by coupling with differentiable paradigms. Our approach introduces soft labeling to achieve differentiable rewards and states, effectively mitigating the sparse-reward issue intrinsic to LTL without compromising objective correctness. We validate the efficacy of our method through experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in both reward attainment and training time compared to the discrete methods.

  We introduce WARP (Weight-space Adaptive Recurrent Prediction), a simple yet powerful framework that unifies weight-space learning with linear recurrence to redefine sequence modeling. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states, WARP explicitly parametrizes the hidden state as the weights of a distinct root neural network. This formulation promotes higher-resolution memory, gradient-free adaptation at test-time, and seamless integration of domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks, spanning synthetic benchmarks to real-world datasets. Furthermore, extensive experiments across sequential image completion, dynamical system reconstruction, and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate its expressiveness and generalization capabilities. Critically, WARP's weight trajectories offer valuable insights into the model's inner workings. Ablation studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring their outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains challenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language (DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible approach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically building a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the validity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which often incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel $\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that identifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time, significantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This further enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a large number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding engine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through comprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON generation, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that Formatron not only $\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant outputs but also achieves $\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference speed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly, Formatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release Formatron as open source atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Slow Feature Analysis is a unsupervised representation learning method that extracts slowly varying features from temporal data and can be used as a basis for subsequent reinforcement learning. Often, the behavior that generates the data on which the representation is learned is assumed to be a uniform random walk. Less research has focused on using samples generated by goal-directed behavior, as commonly the case in a reinforcement learning setting, to learn a representation. In a spatial setting, goal-directed behavior typically leads to significant differences in state occupancy between states that are close to a reward location and far from a reward location.Through the perspective of optimal slow features on ergodic Markov chains, this work investigates the effects of these differences on value-function approximation in an idealized setting. Furthermore, three correction routes, which can potentially alleviate detrimental scaling effects, are evaluated and discussed. In addition, the special case of goal-averse behavior is considered.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of diffusion models, their integration into safety-critical or scientifically rigorous applications remains hindered by the need to ensure compliance with stringent physical, structural, and operational constraints. To address this challenge, this paper introduces Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves diffusion steps with symbolic optimization, enabling the generation of certifiably consistent samples under user-defined functional and logic constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard and discrete diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular structures and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This ability is demonstrated on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in the context of non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory optimization; (2) Data scarcity, in domains such as drug discovery and materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain generalization, where enforcing symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the training distribution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide range of algorithmic tasks -- including mathematical reasoning, memorization, and retrieval -- using only gradient-based training on next-token prediction. While the core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard Transformers to variants in which either the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers or the attention projectors (queries and keys) are frozen at initialization. To further isolate the contribution of attention, we introduce MixiT -- the Mixing Transformer -- a simplified, principled model in which the attention coefficients are entirely random and fixed at initialization, eliminating any input-dependent computation or learning in attention. Surprisingly, we find that MixiT matches the performance of fully trained Transformers on various algorithmic tasks, especially those involving basic arithmetic or focusing heavily on memorization. For retrieval-based tasks, we observe that having input-dependent attention coefficients is consistently beneficial, while MixiT underperforms. We attribute this failure to its inability to form specialized circuits such as induction heads -- a specific circuit known to be crucial for learning and exploiting repeating patterns in input sequences. Even more interestingly, we find that attention with frozen key and query projectors is not only able to form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling. Our results underscore the importance of architectural heterogeneity, where distinct components contribute complementary inductive biases crucial for solving different classes of tasks.

  Large Language Model (LLM) Uncertainty Estimation (UE) methods have become a crucial tool for detecting hallucinations in recent years. While numerous UE methods have been proposed, most existing studies evaluate them in isolated short-form QA settings using threshold-independent metrics such as AUROC or PRR. However, real-world deployment of UE methods introduces several challenges. In this work, we systematically examine four key aspects of deploying UE methods in practical settings. Specifically, we assess (1) the sensitivity of UE methods to decision threshold selection, (2) their robustness to query transformations such as typos, adversarial prompts, and prior chat history, (3) their applicability to long-form generation, and (4) strategies for handling multiple UE scores for a single query. Our evaluations on 19 UE methods reveal that most of them are highly sensitive to threshold selection when there is a distribution shift in the calibration dataset. While these methods generally exhibit robustness against previous chat history and typos, they are significantly vulnerable to adversarial prompts. Additionally, while existing UE methods can be adapted for long-form generation through various strategies, there remains considerable room for improvement. Lastly, ensembling multiple UE scores at test time provides a notable performance boost, which highlights its potential as a practical improvement strategy. Code is available at:this https URL.

  Feature attribution (FA) methods are widely used in explainable AI (XAI) to help users understand how the inputs of a machine learning model contribute to its outputs. However, different FA models often provide disagreeing importance scores for the same model. In the absence of ground truth or in-depth knowledge about the inner workings of the model, it is often difficult to meaningfully determine which of the different FA methods produce more suitable explanations in different contexts. As a step towards addressing this issue, we introduce the open-source XAI-Units benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate FA methods against diverse types of model behaviours, such as feature interactions, cancellations, and discontinuous outputs. Our benchmark provides a set of paired datasets and models with known internal mechanisms, establishing clear expectations for desirable attribution scores. Accompanied by a suite of built-in evaluation metrics, XAI-Units streamlines systematic experimentation and reveals how FA methods perform against distinct, atomic kinds of model reasoning, similar to unit tests in software engineering. Crucially, by using procedurally generated models tied to synthetic datasets, we pave the way towards an objective and reliable comparison of FA methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ultimate goal of verification is to guarantee the safety of deployed neural networks. Here, we claim that all the state-of-the-art verifiers we are aware of fail to reach this goal. Our key insight is that theoretical soundness (bounding the full-precision output while computing with floating point) does not imply practical soundness (bounding the floating point output in a potentially stochastic environment). We prove this observation for the approaches that are currently used to achieve provable theoretical soundness, such as interval analysis and its variants. We also argue that achieving practical soundness is significantly harder computationally. We support our claims empirically as well by evaluating several well-known verification methods. To mislead the verifiers, we create adversarial networks that detect and exploit features of the deployment environment, such as the order and precision of floating point operations. We demonstrate that all the tested verifiers are vulnerable to our new deployment-specific attacks, which proves that they are not practically sound.

  Training large language models (LLMs) poses challenges due to their massive scale and heterogeneous architectures. While adaptive optimizers like AdamW help address gradient variations, they still struggle with efficient and effective parameter-wise learning rate estimation, resulting in training instability, slow convergence, and poor compatibility with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This work introduces Scaling with Gradient Grouping (SGG), an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate estimation by dynamic grouping and group-specific scaling. SGG first groups gradient statistics in each layer into clusters and then applies cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for each parameter, thus imposing collective group-wise constraints while maintaining precise per-parameter adaptation. Experiments on diverse (M)LLM benchmarks show that SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers, and offers consistent gains and faster convergence over baselines, with various model sizes. Its stability across varying batch sizes and learning rates establishes SGG as a robust choice for LLM optimization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model reprogramming adapts pretrained models to downstream tasks by modifying only the input and output spaces. Visual reprogramming (VR) is one instance for vision tasks that adds a trainable noise pattern (i.e., a visual prompt) to input images to facilitate downstream classification. The existing VR approaches for CLIP train a single visual prompt using all descriptions of different downstream classes. However, the limited learning capacity may result in (1) a failure to capture diverse aspects of the descriptions (e.g., shape, color, and texture), and (2) a possible bias toward less informative attributes that do not help distinguish between classes. In this paper, we introduce a decoupling-and-reweighting framework. Our decoupled visual prompts (DVP) are optimized using descriptions grouped by explicit causes (DVP-cse) or unsupervised clusters (DVP-cls). Then, we integrate the outputs of these visual prompts with a probabilistic reweighting matrix (PRM) that measures their contributions to each downstream class. Theoretically, DVP lowers the empirical risk bound. Experimentally, DVP outperforms baselines on average across 11 downstream datasets. Notably, the DVP-PRM integration enables insights into how individual visual prompts influence classification decisions, providing a probabilistic framework for understanding reprogramming.

  _Changshun Wu, Tianyi Duan, Saddek Bensalem, Chih-Hong Cheng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) improves performance on domain-specific tasks but can lead to overfitting, making them unreliable on out-of-distribution (OoD) queries. We propose LoRA-BAM - a method that adds OoD detection monitors to the LoRA layer using boxed abstraction to filter questions beyond the model's competence. Feature vectors from the fine-tuning data are extracted via the LLM and clustered. Clusters are enclosed in boxes; a question is flagged as OoD if its feature vector falls outside all boxes. To improve interpretability and robustness, we introduce a regularization loss during fine-tuning that encourages paraphrased questions to stay close in the feature space, and the enlargement of the decision boundary is based on the feature variance within a cluster. Our method complements existing defenses by providing lightweight and interpretable OoD detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data heterogeneity plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of machine learning (ML) systems. Traditional algorithms, which are typically designed to optimize average performance, often overlook the intrinsic diversity within datasets. This oversight can lead to a myriad of issues, including unreliable decision-making, inadequate generalization across different domains, unfair outcomes, and false scientific inferences. Hence, a nuanced approach to modeling data heterogeneity is essential for the development of dependable, data-driven systems. In this survey paper, we present a thorough exploration of heterogeneity-aware machine learning, a paradigm that systematically integrates considerations of data heterogeneity throughout the entire ML pipeline -- from data collection and model training to model evaluation and deployment. By applying this approach to a variety of critical fields, including healthcare, agriculture, finance, and recommendation systems, we demonstrate the substantial benefits and potential of heterogeneity-aware ML. These applications underscore how a deeper understanding of data diversity can enhance model robustness, fairness, and reliability and help model diagnosis and improvements. Moreover, we delve into future directions and provide research opportunities for the whole data mining community, aiming to promote the development of heterogeneity-aware ML.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimization-based power control algorithms are predominantly iterative with high computational complexity, making them impractical for real-time applications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.

  _Xiaohan Wang, Yu Zhang, Guibin Jiang, Bing Cheng, Wei Lin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Marketing optimization, commonly formulated as an online budget allocation problem, has emerged as a pivotal factor in driving user growth. Most existing research addresses this problem by following the principle of 'first predict then optimize' for each individual, which presents challenges related to large-scale counterfactual prediction and solving complexity trade-offs. Note that the practical data quality is uncontrollable, and the solving scale tends to be tens of millions. Therefore, the existing approaches make the robust budget allocation non-trivial, especially in industrial scenarios with considerable data noise. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach that solves the problem from the cluster perspective. Specifically, we propose a multi-task representation network to learn the inherent attributes of individuals and project the original features into high-dimension hidden representations through the first two layers of the trained network. Then, we divide these hidden representations into $K$ groups through partitioning-based clustering, thus reformulating the problem as an integer stochastic programming problem under different total budgets. Finally, we distill the representation module and clustering model into a multi-category model to facilitate online deployment. Offline experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to six state-of-the-art marketing optimization algorithms. Online A/B tests on the Meituan platform indicate that the approach outperforms the online algorithm by 0.53% and 0.65%, considering order volume (OV) and gross merchandise volume (GMV), respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy, leveraging aggregated updates to build robust global models. However, this training paradigm faces significant challenges due to data heterogeneity and limited local datasets, which often impede effective collaboration. In such scenarios, we identify the Layer-wise Inertia Phenomenon in FL, wherein the middle layers of global model undergo minimal updates after early communication rounds, ultimately limiting the effectiveness of global aggregation. We demonstrate the presence of this phenomenon across a wide range of federated settings, spanning diverse datasets and architectures. To address this issue, we propose LIPS (Layer-wise Inertia Phenomenon with Sparsity), a simple yet effective method that periodically introduces transient sparsity to stimulate meaningful updates and empower global aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that LIPS effectively mitigates layer-wise inertia, enhances aggregation effectiveness, and improves overall performance in various FL scenarios. This work not only deepens the understanding of layer-wise learning dynamics in FL but also paves the way for more effective collaboration strategies in resource-constrained environments.

  _Lennart Bramlage, Crist√≥bal Curio_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncertainty quantification is critical in safety-sensitive applications but is often omitted from off-the-shelf neural networks due to adverse effects on predictive performance. Retrofitting uncertainty estimates post-hoc typically requires access to model parameters or gradients, limiting feasibility in practice. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for post-hoc uncertainty estimation in regression tasks by fitting an auxiliary model to both original inputs and frozen model outputs. Drawing from principles of maximum likelihood estimation and sequential parameter fitting, we formalize an exact post-hoc optimization objective that recovers the canonical MLE of Gaussian parameters, without requiring sampling or approximation at inference. While prior work has used model outputs to estimate uncertainty, we explicitly characterize the conditions under which this is valid and demonstrate the extent to which structured outputs can support quasi-epistemic inference. We find that using diverse auxiliary data, such as augmented subsets of the original training data, significantly enhances OOD detection and metric performance. Our hypothesis that frozen model outputs contain generalizable latent information about model error and predictive uncertainty is tested and confirmed. Finally, we ensure that our method maintains proper estimation of input-dependent uncertainty without relying exclusively on base model forecasts. These findings are demonstrated in toy problems and adapted to both UCI and depth regression benchmarks. Code:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian posterior sampling techniques have demonstrated superior empirical performance in many exploration-exploitation settings. However, their theoretical analysis remains a challenge, especially in complex settings like reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce Q-Learning with Posterior Sampling (PSQL), a simple Q-learning-based algorithm that uses Gaussian posteriors on Q-values for exploration, akin to the popular Thompson Sampling algorithm in the multi-armed bandit setting. We show that in the tabular episodic MDP setting, PSQL achieves a regret bound of $\tilde O(H^2\sqrt{SAT})$, closely matching the known lower bound of $\Omega(H\sqrt{SAT})$. Here, S, A denote the number of states and actions in the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), and $T=KH$ with $K$ being the number of episodes and $H$ being the planning horizon. Our work provides several new technical insights into the core challenges in combining posterior sampling with dynamic programming and TD-learning-based RL algorithms, along with novel ideas for resolving those difficulties. We hope this will form a starting point for analyzing this efficient and important algorithmic technique in even more complex RL settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used framework for training compact, task-specific models by leveraging the knowledge of teacher models. However, its application to active learning (AL), which aims to minimize annotation costs through iterative sample selection, remains underexplored. This gap stems from the fact that KD typically assumes access to sufficient labeled data, whereas AL operates in data-scarce scenarios where task-specific teacher models are often unavailable. In this paper, we introduce ActiveKD, a framework that integrates AL with KD by leveraging the zero- and few-shot capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs). A key aspect of ActiveKD is the structured prediction bias of VLMs--i.e., their predictions form clusters in the probability space. We regard this structure as an inductive bias of the teacher model, capturing generalizable output patterns beneficial to student learning. To exploit this bias, we propose Probabilistic CoreSet (PCoreSet), a selection strategy that maximizes coverage in the probability space rather than the feature space. PCoreSet strategically selects categorically diverse unlabeled samples, facilitating more efficient transfer of teacher knowledge under limited annotation budgets. Evaluations on 11 datasets show that PCoreSet consistently outperforms existing selection methods within the ActiveKD framework, advancing research at the intersection of AL and KD.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in diffusion-based generative modeling have demonstrated significant promise in tackling long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks by leveraging offline datasets. While these approaches have achieved promising results, their reliability remains inconsistent due to the inherent stochastic risk of producing infeasible trajectories, limiting their applicability in safety-critical applications. We identify that the primary cause of these failures is inaccurate guidance during the sampling procedure, and demonstrate the existence of manifold deviation by deriving a lower bound on the guidance gap. To address this challenge, we propose Local Manifold Approximation and Projection (LoMAP), a training-free method that projects the guided sample onto a low-rank subspace approximated from offline datasets, preventing infeasible trajectory generation. We validate our approach on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks that involve challenging long-horizon planning. Furthermore, we show that, as a standalone module, LoMAP can be incorporated into the hierarchical diffusion planner, providing further performance enhancements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling complex fluid systems, especially turbulence governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), remains a fundamental challenge in science and engineering. Recently, diffusion-based generative models have gained attention as a powerful approach for these tasks, owing to their capacity to capture long-range dependencies and recover hierarchical structures. However, we present both empirical and theoretical evidence showing that generative models struggle with significant spectral bias and common-mode noise when generating high-fidelity turbulent flows. Here we propose FourierFlow, a novel generative turbulence modeling framework that enhances the frequency-aware learning by both implicitly and explicitly mitigating spectral bias and common-mode noise. FourierFlow comprises three key innovations. Firstly, we adopt a dual-branch backbone architecture, consisting of a salient flow attention branch with local-global awareness to focus on sensitive turbulence areas. Secondly, we introduce a frequency-guided Fourier mixing branch, which is integrated via an adaptive fusion strategy to explicitly mitigate spectral bias in the generative model. Thirdly, we leverage the high-frequency modeling capabilities of the masked auto-encoder pre-training and implicitly align the features of the generative model toward high-frequency components. We validate the effectiveness of FourierFlow on three canonical turbulent flow scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that our model exhibits strong generalization capabilities in challenging settings such as out-of-distribution domains, long-term temporal extrapolation, and robustness to noisy inputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the empirical success of Diffusion Models (DMs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), their generalization performance remains theoretically underexplored, especially lacking a full consideration of the shared encoder-generator structure. Leveraging recent information-theoretic tools, we propose a unified theoretical framework that provides guarantees for the generalization of both the encoder and generator by treating them as randomized mappings. This framework further enables (1) a refined analysis for VAEs, accounting for the generator's generalization, which was previously overlooked; (2) illustrating an explicit trade-off in generalization terms for DMs that depends on the diffusion time $T$; and (3) providing computable bounds for DMs based solely on the training data, allowing the selection of the optimal $T$ and the integration of such bounds into the optimization process to improve model performance. Empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate the validity of the proposed theory.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate steps remains a critical challenge even after RL.

  _Xingyu Wu, Kui Yu, Jibin Wu, Kay Chen Tan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper critically re-evaluates LLMs' role in causal discovery and argues against their direct involvement in determining causal relationships. We demonstrate that LLMs' autoregressive, correlation-driven modeling inherently lacks the theoretical grounding for causal reasoning and introduces unreliability when used as priors in causal discovery algorithms. Through empirical studies, we expose the limitations of existing LLM-based methods and reveal that deliberate prompt engineering (e.g., injecting ground-truth knowledge) could overstate their performance, helping to explain the consistently favorable results reported in much of the current literature. Based on these findings, we strictly confined LLMs' role to a non-decisional auxiliary capacity: LLMs should not participate in determining the existence or directionality of causal relationships, but can assist the search process for causal graphs (e.g., LLM-based heuristic search). Experiments across various settings confirm that, by strictly isolating LLMs from causal decision-making, LLM-guided heuristic search can accelerate the convergence and outperform both traditional and LLM-based methods in causal structure learning. We conclude with a call for the community to shift focus from naively applying LLMs to developing specialized models and training method that respect the core principles of causal discovery.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models (LLMs) by constraining weight updates to low-rank matrices. Recent works such as Tied-LoRA, VeRA, and VB-LoRA push efficiency further by introducing additional constraints to reduce the trainable parameter space. In this paper, we show that the parameter space reduction strategies employed by these LoRA variants can be formulated within a unified framework, Uni-LoRA, where the LoRA parameter space, flattened as a high-dimensional vector space $R^D$, can be reconstructed through a projection from a subspace R^d, with $d \ll D$. We demonstrate that the fundamental difference among various LoRA methods lies in the choice of the projection matrix, $P \in R^{D \times d}$.Most existing LoRA variants rely on layer-wise or structure-specific projections that limit cross-layer parameter sharing, thereby compromising parameter efficiency. In light of this, we introduce an efficient and theoretically grounded projection matrix that is isometric, enabling global parameter sharing and reducing computation overhead. Furthermore, under the unified view of Uni-LoRA, this design requires only a single trainable vector to reconstruct LoRA parameters for the entire LLM - making Uni-LoRA both a unified framework and a "one-vector-only" solution. Extensive experiments on GLUE, mathematical reasoning, and instruction tuning benchmarks demonstrate that Uni-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art parameter efficiency while outperforming or matching prior approaches in predictive performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatio-temporal time series (STTS) have been widely used in many applications. However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.

  Recently, supervised learning (SL) methodology has emerged as an effective approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their simplicity, stability, and efficiency. However, recent studies show that SL methods lack the trajectory stitching capability, typically associated with temporal difference (TD)-based approaches. A question naturally surfaces: How can we endow SL methods with stitching capability and bridge its performance gap with TD learning? To answer this question, we introduce $Q$-conditioned maximization supervised learning for offline goal-conditioned RL, which enhances SL with the stitching capability through $Q$-conditioned policy and $Q$-conditioned maximization. Concretely, we propose Goal-Conditioned Reinforced Supervised Learning (GCReinSL), which consists of (1) estimating the $Q$-function by CVAE from the offline dataset and (2) finding the maximum $Q$-value within the data support by integrating $Q$-function maximization with Expectile Regression. In inference time, our policy chooses optimal actions based on such a maximum $Q$-value. Experimental results from stitching evaluations on offline RL datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior SL approaches with stitching capabilities and goal data augmentation techniques.

  Recent studies have shown that supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on a small number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities. However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters, offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared to Full FT and LoRA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medicinal chemists often optimize drugs considering their 3D structures and designing structurally distinct molecules that retain key features, such as shapes, pharmacophores, or chemical properties. Previous deep learning approaches address this through supervised tasks like molecule inpainting or property-guided optimization. In this work, we propose a flexible zero-shot molecule manipulation method by navigating in a shared latent space of 3D molecules. We introduce a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for 3D molecules, named MolFLAE, which learns a fixed-dimensional, SE(3)-equivariant latent space independent of atom counts. MolFLAE encodes 3D molecules using an SE(3)-equivariant neural network into fixed number of latent nodes, distinguished by learned embeddings. The latent space is regularized, and molecular structures are reconstructed via a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) conditioned on the encoder's latent output. MolFLAE achieves competitive performance on standard unconditional 3D molecule generation benchmarks. Moreover, the latent space of MolFLAE enables zero-shot molecule manipulation, including atom number editing, structure reconstruction, and coordinated latent interpolation for both structure and properties. We further demonstrate our approach on a drug optimization task for the human glucocorticoid receptor, generating molecules with improved hydrophilicity while preserving key interactions, under computational evaluations. These results highlight the flexibility, robustness, and real-world utility of our method, opening new avenues for molecule editing and optimization.

  We develop hybrid memory architectures for general-purpose sequence processing neural networks, that combine key-value memory using softmax attention (KV-memory) with dynamic synaptic memory through fast-weight programming (FW-memory) -- the core principles of quadratic and linear transformers, respectively. These two memory systems have complementary but individually limited properties: KV-memory offers precise retrieval but is constrained by quadratic complexity in sequence length, while FW-memory supports arbitrarily long sequences and enables more expressive computation but sacrifices precise recall. We propose and compare three methods to blend these two systems into a single memory system to leverage the strengths of both. We conduct experiments on general language modeling and retrieval tasks by training 340M- and 1.3B-parameter models from scratch, as well as on synthetic algorithmic tasks designed to precisely illustrate the benefits of certain hybrid methods over others. We also evaluate our hybrid memory systems on reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. Overall, we demonstrate how a well-designed hybrid can overcome the limitations of its individual components, offering new insights into the design principle of neural memory systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical laws into the training process. However, the performance of PINNs is often hindered in real-world scenarios involving noisy observational data and missing physics, particularly in inverse problems. In this work, we propose an iterative multi-objective PINN ensemble Kalman filter (MoPINNEnKF) framework that improves the robustness and accuracy of PINNs in both forward and inverse problems by using the \textit{ensemble Kalman filter} and the \textit{non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm} III (NSGA-III). Specifically, NSGA-III is used as a multi-objective optimizer that can generate various ensemble members of PINNs along the optimal Pareto front, while accounting the model uncertainty in the solution space. These ensemble members are then utilized within the EnKF to assimilate noisy observational data. The EnKF's analysis is subsequently used to refine the data loss component for retraining the PINNs, thereby iteratively updating their parameters. The iterative procedure generates improved solutions to the PDEs. The proposed method is tested on two benchmark problems: the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion-wave equation (TFMDWE). The numerical results show it outperforms standard PINNs in handling noisy data and missing physics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have shown robust results in plane reformatting tasks. In these methods, an agent sequentially adjusts the position and orientation of an initial plane towards an objective location. This process allows accurate plane reformatting, without the need for detailed landmarks, which makes it suitable for images with limited contrast and resolution, such as 4D flow MRI. However, current DRL methods require the test dataset to be in the same position and orientation as the training dataset. In this paper, we present a novel technique that utilizes a flexible coordinate system based on the current state, enabling navigation in volumes at any position or orientation. We adopted the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm for reinforcement learning, outperforming Deep Q Network (DQN). Experimental results in 4D flow MRI demonstrate improved accuracy in plane reformatting angular and distance errors (6.32 +- 4.15 ¬∞ and 3.40 +- 2.75 mm), as well as statistically equivalent flow measurements determined by a plane reformatting process done by an expert (p=0.21). The method's flexibility and adaptability make it a promising candidate for other medical imaging applications beyond 4D flow MRI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Clinical decision-making routinely demands reasoning over heterogeneous data, yet existing multimodal language models (MLLMs) remain largely vision-centric and fail to generalize across clinical specialties. To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world databases are predominantly relational, comprising multiple interlinked tables that contain complex structural and statistical dependencies. Learning generative models on relational data has shown great promise in generating synthetic data and imputing missing values. However, existing methods often struggle to capture this complexity, typically reducing relational data to conditionally generated flat tables and imposing limiting structural assumptions. To address these limitations, we introduce RelDiff, a novel diffusion generative model that synthesizes complete relational databases by explicitly modeling their foreign key graph structure. RelDiff combines a joint graph-conditioned diffusion process across all tables for attribute synthesis, and a $2K+$SBM graph generator based on the Stochastic Block Model for structure generation. The decomposition of graph structure and relational attributes ensures both high fidelity and referential integrity, both of which are crucial aspects of synthetic relational database generation. Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that RelDiff consistently outperforms prior methods in producing realistic and coherent synthetic relational databases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Determining whether a dataset was part of a machine learning model's training data pool can reveal privacy vulnerabilities, a challenge often addressed through membership inference attacks (MIAs). Traditional MIAs typically require access to model internals or rely on computationally intensive shadow models. This paper proposes an efficient, interpretable and principled Bayesian inference method for membership inference. By analyzing post-hoc metrics such as prediction error, confidence (entropy), perturbation magnitude, and dataset statistics from a trained ML model, our approach computes posterior probabilities of membership without requiring extensive model training. Experimental results on synthetic datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in distinguishing member from non-member datasets. Beyond membership inference, this method can also detect distribution shifts, offering a practical and interpretable alternative to existing approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In constrained Markov decision processes, enforcing constraints during training is often thought of as decreasing the final return. Recently, it was shown that constraints can be incorporated directly in the policy geometry, yielding an optimization trajectory close to the central path of a barrier method, which does not compromise final return. Building on this idea, we introduce Central Path Proximal Policy Optimization (C3PO), a simple modification of PPO that produces policy iterates, which stay close to the central path of the constrained optimization problem. Compared to existing on-policy methods, C3PO delivers improved performance with tighter constraint enforcement, suggesting that central path-guided updates offer a promising direction for constrained policy optimization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant computational resources and extended training times. To address this, we build upon the foundation laid by Google Brain's Sensory Neuron, which introduced a novel neural architecture for reinforcement learning tasks that maintained permutation in-variance in the sensory neuron system. While the baseline model demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional approaches, we identified opportunities to enhance the efficiency of the learning process further. We propose a modified attention mechanism incorporating a non-linear transformation of the key vectors (K) using a mapping function, resulting in a new set of key vectors (K'). This non-linear mapping enhances the representational capacity of the attention mechanism, allowing the model to encode more complex feature interactions and accelerating convergence without compromising performance. Our enhanced model demonstrates significant improvements in learning efficiency, showcasing the potential for non-linear attention mechanisms in advancing reinforcement learning algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning aims to remove sensitive or undesired data from large language models. However, recent studies suggest that unlearning is often shallow, claiming that removed knowledge can easily be recovered. In this work, we critically examine standard unlearning evaluation practices and uncover key limitations that shake our trust in those findings. First, we show that some evaluations introduce substantial new information into the model, potentially masking true unlearning performance by re-teaching the model during testing. Second, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes vary significantly across tasks, undermining the generalizability of current evaluation routines. Finally, we find that many evaluations rely on spurious correlations, making their results difficult to trust and interpret. Taken together, these issues suggest that current evaluation protocols may both overstate and understate unlearning success. To address this, we propose two principles for future unlearning evaluations: minimal information injection and downstream task awareness. We validate these principles through a series of targeted experiments, showing how violations of each can lead to misleading conclusions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and safety-first defenses have proliferated rapidly. However, the number of approaches and their recent increase have resulted in diverse evaluations-varied datasets, metrics, and inconsistent threat settings-making it difficult to fairly compare safety, utility, and robustness across methods. To address this, we introduce SafeTuneBed, a benchmark and toolkit unifying fine-tuning and defense evaluation. SafeTuneBed (i) curates a diverse repository of multiple fine-tuning datasets spanning sentiment analysis, question-answering, multi-step reasoning, and open-ended instruction tasks, and allows for the generation of harmful-variant splits; (ii) enables integration of state-of-the-art defenses, including alignment-stage immunization, in-training safeguards, and post-tuning repair; and (iii) provides evaluators for safety (attack success rate, refusal consistency) and utility. Built on Python-first, dataclass-driven configs and plugins, SafeTuneBed requires minimal additional code to specify any fine-tuning regime, defense method, and metric suite, while ensuring end-to-end reproducibility. We showcase its value by benchmarking representative defenses across varied poisoning scenarios and tasks. By standardizing data, code, and metrics, SafeTuneBed is the first focused toolkit of its kind to accelerate rigorous and comparable research in safe LLM fine-tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Differential privacy (DP) is a key technique for protecting sensitive patient data in medical deep learning (DL). As clinical models grow more data-dependent, balancing privacy with utility and fairness has become a critical challenge. This scoping review synthesizes recent developments in applying DP to medical DL, with a particular focus on DP-SGD and alternative mechanisms across centralized and federated settings. Using a structured search strategy, we identified 74 studies published up to March 2025. Our analysis spans diverse data modalities, training setups, and downstream tasks, and highlights the tradeoffs between privacy guarantees, model accuracy, and subgroup fairness. We find that while DP-especially at strong privacy budgets-can preserve performance in well-structured imaging tasks, severe degradation often occurs under strict privacy, particularly in underrepresented or complex modalities. Furthermore, privacy-induced performance gaps disproportionately affect demographic subgroups, with fairness impacts varying by data type and task. A small subset of studies explicitly addresses these tradeoffs through subgroup analysis or fairness metrics, but most omit them entirely. Beyond DP-SGD, emerging approaches leverage alternative mechanisms, generative models, and hybrid federated designs, though reporting remains inconsistent. We conclude by outlining key gaps in fairness auditing, standardization, and evaluation protocols, offering guidance for future work toward equitable and clinically robust privacy-preserving DL systems in medicine.

  _Aris J. Aristorenas_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a permutation-invariant neural architecture for indoor localization using RSSI scans from Wi-Fi access points. Each scan is modeled as an unordered set of (BSSID, RSSI) pairs, where BSSIDs are mapped to learned embeddings and concatenated with signal strength. These are processed by a Set Transformer, enabling the model to handle variable-length, sparse inputs while learning attention- based representations over access point relationships. We evaluate the model on a dataset collected across a campus environment consisting of six buildings. Results show that the model accurately recovers fine-grained spatial structure and maintains performance across physically distinct domains. In our experiments, a simple LSTM consistently outperformed all other models, achieving the lowest mean localization error across three tasks (E1 - E3), with average errors as low as 2.23 m. The Set Transformer performed competitively, ranking second in every experiment and outperforming the MLP, RNN, and basic attention models, particularly in scenarios involving multiple buildings (E2) and multiple floors (E3). Performance degraded most in E2, where signal conditions varied substantially across buildings, highlighting the importance of architectural robustness to domain diversity. This work demonstrates that set-based neural models are a natural fit for signal-based localization, offering a principled approach to handling sparse, unordered inputs in real-world positioning tasks.

  _Femi Bello, Anubrata Das, Fanzhi Zeng, Fangcong Yin, Leqi Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models, regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding representation alignment across model scales.

  Deep neural networks have achieved substantial success across various scientific computing tasks. A pivotal challenge within this domain is the rapid and parallel approximation of matrix inverses, critical for numerous applications. Despite significant progress, there currently exists no universal neural-based method for approximating matrix inversion. This paper presents a theoretical analysis demonstrating the fundamental limitations of neural networks in developing a general matrix inversion model. We expand the class of Lipschitz functions to encompass a wider array of neural network models, thereby refining our theoretical approach. Moreover, we delineate specific conditions under which neural networks can effectively approximate matrix inverses. Our theoretical results are supported by experimental results from diverse matrix datasets, exploring the efficacy of neural networks in addressing the matrix inversion challenge.

  Decision-making in building energy systems critically depends on the predictive accuracy of relevant time-series models. In scenarios lacking extensive data from a target building, foundation models (FMs) represent a promising technology that can leverage prior knowledge from vast and diverse pre-training datasets to construct accurate probabilistic predictors for use in decision-making tools. This paper investigates the applicability and fine-tuning strategies of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) in building energy forecasting. We analyze both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, particularly low-rank adaptation (LoRA), by using real-world data from a commercial net-zero energy building to capture signals such as room occupancy, carbon emissions, plug loads, and HVAC energy consumption. Our analysis reveals that the zero-shot predictive performance of TSFMs is generally suboptimal. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that employing either full fine-tuning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning significantly enhances forecasting accuracy, even with limited historical data. Notably, fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) substantially reduces computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, fine-tuned TSFMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art deep forecasting models (e.g., temporal fusion transformers) in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across varying building zones and seasonal conditions. These results underline the efficacy of TSFMs for practical, data-constrained building energy management systems, enabling improved decision-making in pursuit of energy efficiency and sustainability.

  Model Reprogramming (MR) is a resource-efficient framework that adapts large pre-trained models to new tasks with minimal additional parameters and data, offering a promising solution to the challenges of training large models for diverse tasks. Despite its empirical success across various domains such as computer vision and time-series forecasting, the theoretical foundations of MR remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of MR through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework. We demonstrate that the success of MR is governed by the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK matrix on the target dataset and establish the critical role of the source model's effectiveness in determining reprogramming outcomes. Our contributions include a novel theoretical framework for MR, insights into the relationship between source and target models, and extensive experiments validating our findings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world multichannel time series prediction faces growing demands for efficiency across edge and cloud environments, making channel compression a timely and essential problem. Motivated by success of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) methods, we propose a predictability-aware compression-decompression framework to reduce runtime, lower communication cost, and maintain prediction accuracy across diverse predictors. The core idea involves using a circular periodicity key matrix with orthogonality to capture underlying time series predictability during compression and to mitigate reconstruction errors during decompression by relaxing oversimplified data assumptions. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that the proposed framework is both time-efficient and scalable under a large number of channels. Extensive experiments on six datasets across various predictors demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior overall performance by jointly considering prediction accuracy and runtime, while maintaining strong compatibility with diverse predictors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph anomaly detection faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of reliable anomaly-labeled datasets, driving the development of unsupervised methods. Graph autoencoders (GAEs) have emerged as a dominant approach by reconstructing graph structures and node features while deriving anomaly scores from reconstruction errors. However, relying solely on reconstruction error for anomaly detection has limitations, as it increases the sensitivity to noise and overfitting. To address these issues, we propose Graph Evidential Learning (GEL), a probabilistic framework that redefines the reconstruction process through evidential learning. By modeling node features and graph topology using evidential distributions, GEL quantifies two types of uncertainty: graph uncertainty and reconstruction uncertainty, incorporating them into the anomaly scoring mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEL achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high robustness against noise and structural perturbations.

  Plasticity, or the ability of an agent to adapt to new tasks, environments, or distributions, is crucial for continual learning. In this paper, we study the loss of plasticity in deep continual RL from the lens of churn: network output variability for out-of-batch data induced by mini-batch training. We demonstrate that (1) the loss of plasticity is accompanied by the exacerbation of churn due to the gradual rank decrease of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrix; (2) reducing churn helps prevent rank collapse and adjusts the step size of regular RL gradients adaptively. Moreover, we introduce Continual Churn Approximated Reduction (C-CHAIN) and demonstrate it improves learning performance and outperforms baselines in a diverse range of continual learning environments on OpenAI Gym Control, ProcGen, DeepMind Control Suite, and MinAtar benchmarks.

  In this pilot study, we propose a neuro-inspired approach that compresses temporal sequences into context-tagged chunks, where each tag represents a recurring structural unit or``community'' in the sequence. These tags are generated during an offline sleep phase and serve as compact references to past experience, allowing the learner to incorporate information beyond its immediate input range. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that temporal chunking can significantly enhance learning efficiency under resource constrained settings. A small-scale human pilot study using a Serial Reaction Time Task further motivates the idea of structural abstraction. Although limited to synthetic tasks, this work serves as an early proof-of-concept, with initial evidence that learned context tags can transfer across related task, offering potential for future applications in transfer learning.

  Stress significantly contributes to both mental and physical disorders, yet traditional self-reported questionnaires are inherently subjective. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that employs geometric machine learning to detect stress from raw EEG recordings. Our approach constructs graphs by integrating structural connectivity (derived from electrode spatial arrangement) with functional connectivity from pairwise signal correlations. A spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) processes these graphs to capture spatial and temporal dynamics. Experiments on the SAM-40 dataset show that the ST-GCN outperforms standard machine learning models on all key classification metrics and enhances interpretability, explored through ablation analyses of key channels and brain regions. These results pave the way for more objective and accurate stress detection methods.

  _Fatemeh Lotfi, Hossein Rajoli, Fatemeh Afghah_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advanced wireless networks must support highly dynamic and heterogeneous service demands. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables this flexibility by adopting modular, disaggregated components, such as the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), Centralized Unit (CU), and Distributed Unit (DU), that can support intelligent control via machine learning (ML). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for managing dynamic resource allocation and slicing, it often struggles to process raw, unstructured input like RF features, QoS metrics, and traffic trends. These limitations hinder policy generalization and decision efficiency in partially observable and evolving environments. To address this, we propose \textit{ORAN-GUIDE}, a dual-LLM framework that enhances multi-agent RL (MARL) with task-relevant, semantically enriched state representations. The architecture employs a domain-specific language model, ORANSight, pretrained on O-RAN control and configuration data, to generate structured, context-aware prompts. These prompts are fused with learnable tokens and passed to a frozen GPT-based encoder that outputs high-level semantic representations for DRL agents. This design adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style pipeline tailored for technical decision-making in wireless systems. Experimental results show that ORAN-GUIDE improves sample efficiency, policy convergence, and performance generalization over standard MARL and single-LLM baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern wireless networks must adapt to dynamic conditions while efficiently managing diverse service demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) struggles in these environments, as scattered and evolving feedback makes optimal decision-making challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution by structuring unorganized network feedback into meaningful latent representations, helping RL agents recognize patterns more effectively. For example, in O-RAN slicing, concepts like SNR, power levels and throughput are semantically related, and LLMs can naturally cluster them, providing a more interpretable state representation. To leverage this capability, we introduce a contextualization-based adaptation method that integrates learnable prompts into an LLM-augmented DRL framework. Instead of relying on full model fine-tuning, we refine state representations through task-specific prompts that dynamically adjust to network conditions. Utilizing ORANSight, an LLM trained on O-RAN knowledge, we develop Prompt-Augmented Multi agent RL (PA-MRL) framework. Learnable prompts optimize both semantic clustering and RL objectives, allowing RL agents to achieve higher rewards in fewer iterations and adapt more efficiently. By incorporating prompt-augmented learning, our approach enables faster, more scalable, and adaptive resource allocation in O-RAN slicing. Experimental results show that it accelerates convergence and outperforms other baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When aligning large language models (LLMs), their performance on various tasks (such as being helpful, harmless, and honest) depends heavily on the composition of their training data. However, selecting a data mixture that achieves strong performance across all tasks is challenging. Existing approaches rely on large ablation studies, heuristics, or human intuition, but these can be prohibitively expensive and suboptimal. We study this problem in the setting of preference optimization via DPO and introduce AutoMixAlign (AMA), a theoretically-grounded algorithm that adaptively mixes datasets during training to balance performance across tasks. AMA first trains \textit{specialist models} for each task to determine losses that correspond to strong task performance. Then, it trains a generalist model using a novel minimax optimization that prioritizes tasks for which generalist model losses deviate most from specialist model losses. To optimize this problem, we propose two algorithms: (1) AMA-R, which adaptively reweights the objective to prioritize tasks, and (2) AMA-S, which adaptively adjusts how much data is sampled from each task to prioritize tasks. Both algorithms achieve a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ in the convex case. AMA-R's convergence result follows from Sagawa et al. (2019), and we provide a convergence proof for AMA-S using online learning techniques such as EXP3. We evaluate AMA on several multitask alignment setups and find that AMA outperforms the standard alignment approach -- which simply optimizes the total loss across all tasks -- and also outperforms model merging methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A key approach to state abstraction is approximating behavioral metrics (notably, bisimulation metrics) in the observation space and embedding these learned distances in the representation space. While promising for robustness to task-irrelevant noise, as shown in prior work, accurately estimating these metrics remains challenging, requiring various design choices that create gaps between theory and practice. Prior evaluations focus mainly on final returns, leaving the quality of learned metrics and the source of performance gains unclear. To systematically assess how metric learning works in deep reinforcement learning (RL), we evaluate five recent approaches, unified conceptually as isometric embeddings with varying design choices. We benchmark them with baselines across 20 state-based and 14 pixel-based tasks, spanning 370 task configurations with diverse noise settings. Beyond final returns, we introduce the evaluation of a denoising factor to quantify the encoder's ability to filter distractions. To further isolate the effect of metric learning, we propose and evaluate an isolated metric estimation setting, in which the encoder is influenced solely by the metric loss. Finally, we release an open-source, modular codebase to improve reproducibility and support future research on metric learning in deep RL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Missing data is a relevant issue in time series, especially in biomedical sequences such as those corresponding to smooth pursuit eye movements, which often contain gaps due to eye blinks and track losses, complicating the analysis and extraction of meaningful biomarkers. In this paper, a novel imputation framework is proposed using Self-Attention-based Imputation networks for time series, which leverages the power of deep learning and self-attention mechanisms to impute missing data. We further refine the imputed data using a custom made autoencoder, tailored to represent smooth pursuit eye movement sequences. The proposed approach was implemented using 5,504 sequences from 172 Parkinsonian patients and healthy controls. Results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed eye movement sequences with respect to other state of the art techniques, substantially reducing the values for common time domain error metrics such as the mean absolute error, mean relative error, and root mean square error, while also preserving the signal's frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness when large intervals of data are missing. This method offers an alternative solution for robustly handling missing data in time series, enhancing the reliability of smooth pursuit analysis for the screening and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders.

  The integration of wind energy into power grids necessitates accurate ultra-short-term wind power forecasting to ensure grid stability and optimize resource allocation. This study introduces M2WLLM, an innovative model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting wind power output at granular time intervals. M2WLLM overcomes the limitations of traditional and deep learning methods by seamlessly integrating textual information and temporal numerical data, significantly improving wind power forecasting accuracy through multi-modal data. Its architecture features a Prompt Embedder and a Data Embedder, enabling an effective fusion of textual prompts and numerical inputs within the LLMs framework. The Semantic Augmenter within the Data Embedder translates temporal data into a format that the LLMs can comprehend, enabling it to extract latent features and improve prediction accuracy. The empirical evaluations conducted on wind farm data from three Chinese provinces demonstrate that M2WLLM consistently outperforms existing methods, such as GPT4TS, across various datasets and prediction horizons. The results highlight LLMs' ability to enhance accuracy and robustness in ultra-short-term forecasting and showcase their strong few-shot learning capabilities.

  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending enables permissionless borrowing via smart contracts. However, it faces challenges in optimizing interest rates, mitigating bad debt, and improving capital efficiency. Rule-based interest-rate models struggle to adapt to dynamic market conditions, leading to inefficiencies. This work applies Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize interest rate adjustments in DeFi lending protocols. Using historical data from Aave protocol, we evaluate three RL approaches: Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), Behavior Cloning (BC), and TD3 with Behavior Cloning (TD3-BC). TD3-BC demonstrates superior performance in balancing utilization, capital stability, and risk, outperforming existing models. It adapts effectively to historical stress events like the May 2021 crash and the March 2023 USDC depeg, showcasing potential for automated, real-time governance.

  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for up-to-date and well-organized benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. However, many existing datasets are scattered, difficult to manage, and make it challenging to perform evaluations tailored to specific needs or domains, despite the growing importance of domain-specific models in areas such as math or code. In this paper, we introduce BenchHub, a dynamic benchmark repository that empowers researchers and developers to evaluate LLMs more effectively. BenchHub aggregates and automatically classifies benchmark datasets from diverse domains, integrating 303K questions across 38 benchmarks. It is designed to support continuous updates and scalable data management, enabling flexible and customizable evaluation tailored to various domains or use cases. Through extensive experiments with various LLM families, we demonstrate that model performance varies significantly across domain-specific subsets, emphasizing the importance of domain-aware benchmarking. We believe BenchHub can encourage better dataset reuse, more transparent model comparisons, and easier identification of underrepresented areas in existing benchmarks, offering a critical infrastructure for advancing LLM evaluation research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) aims to optimize generator power outputs by utilizing the non-linear relationships between voltage magnitudes and phase angles in a power system. However, current AC-OPF solvers struggle to effectively represent the complex relationship between variable distributions in the constraint space and their corresponding optimal solutions. This limitation in constraint modeling restricts the system's ability to develop diverse knowledge representations. Additionally, modeling the power grid solely based on spatial topology further limits the integration of additional prior knowledge, such as temporal information. To overcome these challenges, we propose DDA-PIGCN (Dynamic Domain Adaptation-Driven Physics-Informed Graph Convolutional Network), a new method designed to address constraint-related issues and build a graph-based learning framework that incorporates spatiotemporal features. DDA-PIGCN improves consistency optimization for features with varying long-range dependencies by applying multi-layer, hard physics-informed constraints. It also uses a dynamic domain adaptation learning mechanism that iteratively updates and refines key state variables under predefined constraints, enabling precise constraint verification. Moreover, it captures spatiotemporal dependencies between generators and loads by leveraging the physical structure of the power grid, allowing for deep integration of topological information across time and space. Extensive comparative and ablation studies show that DDA-PIGCN delivers strong performance across several IEEE standard test cases (such as case9, case30, and case300), achieving mean absolute errors (MAE) from 0.0011 to 0.0624 and constraint satisfaction rates between 99.6% and 100%, establishing it as a reliable and efficient AC-OPF solver.

  _Abhisek Ray, Lukas Esterle_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed data sources while preserving data locality. However, the privacy of local data is always a pivotal concern and has received a lot of attention in recent research on the FL regime. Moreover, the lack of domain heterogeneity and client-specific segregation in the benchmarks remains a critical bottleneck for rigorous evaluation. In this paper, we introduce ModelNet, a novel image classification dataset constructed from the embeddings extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 model. First, we modify the CIFAR100 dataset into three client-specific variants, considering three domain heterogeneities (homogeneous, heterogeneous, and random). Subsequently, we train each client-specific subset of all three variants on the pre-trained ResNet50 model to save model parameters. In addition to multi-domain image data, we propose a new hypothesis to define the FL algorithm that can access the anonymized model parameters to preserve the local privacy in a more effective manner compared to existing ones. ModelNet is designed to simulate realistic FL settings by incorporating non-IID data distributions and client diversity design principles in the mainframe for both conventional and futuristic graph-driven FL algorithms. The three variants are ModelNet-S, ModelNet-D, and ModelNet-R, which are based on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and random data settings, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a cross-environment client-specific FL dataset along with the graph-based variant. Extensive experiments based on domain shifts and aggregation strategies show the effectiveness of the above variants, making it a practical benchmark for classical and graph-based FL research. The dataset and related code are available online.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural networks have demonstrated exceptional performance in supervised learning, benefiting from abundant high-quality annotated data. However, obtaining such data in real-world scenarios is costly and labor-intensive. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to this problem. Recent studies, such as Semi-ViT and Noisy Student, which employ consistency regularization or pseudo-labeling, have demonstrated significant achievements. However, they still face challenges, particularly in accurately selecting sufficient high-quality pseudo-labels due to their reliance on fixed thresholds. Recent methods such as FlexMatch and FreeMatch have introduced flexible or self-adaptive thresholding techniques, greatly advancing SSL research. Nonetheless, their process of updating thresholds at each iteration is deemed time-consuming, computationally intensive, and potentially unnecessary. To address these issues, we propose Self-training with Self-adaptive Thresholding (SST), a novel, effective, and efficient SSL framework. SST introduces an innovative Self-Adaptive Thresholding (SAT) mechanism that adaptively adjusts class-specific thresholds based on the model's learning progress. SAT ensures the selection of high-quality pseudo-labeled data, mitigating the risks of inaccurate pseudo-labels and confirmation bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SST achieves state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency, generalization, and scalability across various architectures and datasets. Semi-SST-ViT-Huge achieves the best results on competitive ImageNet-1K SSL benchmarks, with 80.7% / 84.9% Top-1 accuracy using only 1% / 10% labeled data. Compared to the fully-supervised DeiT-III-ViT-Huge, which achieves 84.8% Top-1 accuracy using 100% labeled data, our method demonstrates superior performance using only 10% labeled data.

  We aim to better understand the tradeoffs between traditional and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for energy storage management. More specifically, we wish to better understand the performance loss incurred when using a generative RL policy instead of using a traditional approach to find optimal control policies for specific instances. Our comparison is based on a simplified micro-grid model, that includes a load component, a photovoltaic source, and a storage device. Based on this model, we examine three use cases of increasing complexity: ideal storage with convex cost functions, lossy storage devices, and lossy storage devices with convex transmission losses. With the aim of promoting the principled use RL based methods in this challenging and important domain, we provide a detailed formulation of each use case and a detailed description of the optimization challenges. We then compare the performance of traditional and RL methods, discuss settings in which it is beneficial to use each method, and suggest avenues for future investigation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks without domain-specific training, fueling interest in their potential for time-series forecasting. While LLMs have shown potential in zero-shot forecasting through prompting alone, recent studies suggest that LLMs lack inherent effectiveness in forecasting. Given these conflicting findings, a rigorous validation is essential for drawing reliable conclusions. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs as zero-shot forecasters compared to state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our experiments show that LLM-based zero-shot forecasters often struggle to achieve high accuracy due to their sensitivity to noise, underperforming even simple domain-specific models. We have explored solutions to reduce LLMs' sensitivity to noise in the zero-shot setting, but improving their robustness remains a significant challenge. Our findings suggest that rather than emphasizing zero-shot forecasting, a more promising direction would be to focus on fine-tuning LLMs to better process numerical sequences.

  Dynamic graphs evolve continuously, presenting challenges for traditional graph learning due to their changing structures and temporal dependencies. Recent advancements have shown potential in addressing these challenges by developing suitable meta-learning-based dynamic graph neural network models. However, most meta-learning approaches for dynamic graphs rely on fixed weight update parameters, neglecting the essential intrinsic complex high-order topological information of dynamically evolving graphs. We have designed Dowker Zigzag Persistence (DZP), an efficient and stable dynamic graph persistent homology representation method based on Dowker complex and zigzag persistence, to capture the high-order features of dynamic graphs. Armed with the DZP ideas, we propose TMetaNet, a new meta-learning parameter update model based on dynamic topological features. By utilizing the distances between high-order topological features, TMetaNet enables more effective adaptation across snapshots. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate TMetaNet's state-of-the-art performance and resilience to graph noise, illustrating its high potential for meta-learning and dynamic graph analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning (ML) model training while preserving data privacy by keeping data localized across clients. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients poses a significant challenge, leading to skewed model updates and performance degradation. Addressing this, we propose PSI-PFL, a novel client selection framework for Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) that leverages the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify and mitigate data heterogeneity (so-called non-IIDness). Our approach selects more homogeneous clients based on PSI, reducing the impact of label skew, one of the most detrimental factors in FL performance. Experimental results over multiple data modalities (tabular, image, text) demonstrate that PSI-PFL significantly improves global model accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10\% under non-IID scenarios while ensuring fairer local performance. PSI-PFL enhances FL performance and offers practical benefits in applications where data privacy and heterogeneity are critical.

  Ensembling large language models (LLMs) can effectively combine diverse strengths of different models, offering a promising approach to enhance performance across various tasks. However, existing methods typically rely on fixed weighting strategies that fail to adapt to the dynamic, context-dependent characteristics of LLM capabilities. In this work, we propose Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Ensemble for LLMs (RLAE), a novel framework that reformulates LLM ensemble through the lens of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach introduces a RL agent that dynamically adjusts ensemble weights by considering both input context and intermediate generation states, with the agent being trained using rewards that directly correspond to the quality of final outputs. We implement RLAE using both single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms ($\text{RLAE}_\text{PPO}$ and $\text{RLAE}_\text{MAPPO}$ ), demonstrating substantial improvements over conventional ensemble methods. Extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks show that RLAE outperforms existing approaches by up to $3.3\%$ accuracy points, offering a more effective framework for LLM ensembling. Furthermore, our method exhibits superior generalization capabilities across different tasks without the need for retraining, while simultaneously achieving lower time latency.

While numerous post-hoc instance-level explanation methods have been proposed to interpret GNN predictions, the reliability of these explanations remains uncertain, particularly in the out-of-distribution or unknown test datasets. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing an explainer framework with the confidence scoring module ( ConfExplainer), grounded in theoretical principle, which is generalized graph information bottleneck with confidence constraint (GIB-CC), that quantifies the reliability of generated explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the effectiveness of the confidence score in enhancing the trustworthiness and robustness of GNN explanations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to the proficiency of self-attention mechanisms (SAMs) in capturing dependencies in sequence modeling, several existing dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) utilize Transformer architectures with various encoding designs to capture sequential evolutions of dynamic graphs. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these Transformer-based DGNNs vary significantly, highlighting the importance of properly defining the SAM on dynamic graphs and comprehensively encoding temporal and interactive dynamics without extra complex modules. In this work, we propose TIDFormer, a dynamic graph TransFormer that fully exploits Temporal and Interactive Dynamics in an efficient manner. We clarify and verify the interpretability of our proposed SAM, addressing the open problem of its uninterpretable definitions on dynamic graphs in previous works. To model the temporal and interactive dynamics, respectively, we utilize the calendar-based time partitioning information and extract informative interaction embeddings for both bipartite and non-bipartite graphs using merely the sampled first-order neighbors. In addition, we jointly model temporal and interactive features by capturing potential changes in historical interaction patterns through a simple decomposition. We conduct extensive experiments on several dynamic graph datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TIDFormer. The experimental results demonstrate that TIDFormer excels, outperforming state-of-the-art models across most datasets and experimental settings. Furthermore, TIDFormer exhibits significant efficiency advantages compared to previous Transformer-based methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting anomalies in the data collected by WSNs can provide crucial evidence for assessing the reliability and stability of WSNs. Existing methods for WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction of spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few anomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these issues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both model architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed. In terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network includes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR) module, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network module to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can integrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN neighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data. Moreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce inference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was designed. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series data with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to learn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive learning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the dataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples into few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was developed to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the problem of sample imbalance effectively. In experiments carried out on real public datasets, the designed MTAD-RD anomaly detection method achieved an F1 score of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection methods.

  Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses explicit reward engineering by inferring reward functions from human preference comparisons, enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, humans often struggle to label a clear preference between similar segments, reducing label efficiency and limiting PbRL's real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an offline PbRL method: Contrastive LeArning for ResolvIng Ambiguous Feedback (CLARIFY), which learns a trajectory embedding space that incorporates preference information, ensuring clearly distinguished segments are spaced apart, thus facilitating the selection of more unambiguous queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLARIFY outperforms baselines in both non-ideal teachers and real human feedback settings. Our approach not only selects more distinguished queries but also learns meaningful trajectory embeddings.

  Understanding how feature representations evolve across layers in large language models (LLMs) is key to improving their interpretability and robustness. While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered Kernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions. We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain adaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction compared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them reduces attack success rates by up to 40%.

  The automatic classification of medical time series signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), plays a pivotal role in clinical decision support and early detection of diseases. Although Transformer based models have achieved notable performance by implicitly modeling temporal dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, their inherently complex architectures and opaque reasoning processes undermine their trustworthiness in high stakes clinical settings. In response to these limitations, this study shifts focus toward a modeling paradigm that emphasizes structural transparency, aligning more closely with the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. We propose a novel method, Channel Imposed Fusion (CIF), which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio through cross-channel information fusion, effectively reduces redundancy, and improves classification performance. Furthermore, we integrate CIF with the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), known for its structural simplicity and controllable receptive field, to construct an efficient and explicit classification framework. Experimental results on multiple publicly available EEG and ECG datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of various classification metrics, but also significantly enhances the transparency of the classification process, offering a novel perspective for medical time series classification.

  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality.We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to 1.63x end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at \texttt{this https URL}.

  We present a new active learning framework for multiclass classification based on surrogate risk minimization that operates beyond the standard realizability assumption. Existing surrogate-based active learning algorithms crucially rely on realizability$\unicode{x2014}$the assumption that the optimal surrogate predictor lies within the model class$\unicode{x2014}$limiting their applicability in practical, misspecified settings. In this work we show that under conditions significantly weaker than realizability, as long as the class of models considered is convex, one can still obtain a label and sample complexity comparable to prior work. Despite achieving similar rates, the algorithmic approaches from prior works can be shown to fail in non-realizable settings where our assumption is satisfied. Our epoch-based active learning algorithm departs from prior methods by fitting a model from the full class to the queried data in each epoch and returning an improper classifier obtained by aggregating these models.

  Diffusion models are state-of-the-art generative models in various domains, yet their samples often fail to satisfy downstream objectives such as safety constraints or domain-specific validity. Existing techniques for alignment require gradients, internal model access, or large computational budgets. We introduce an inference-time alignment framework based on evolutionary algorithms. We treat diffusion models as black-boxes and search their latent space to maximize alignment objectives. Our method enables efficient inference-time alignment for both differentiable and non-differentiable alignment objectives across a range of diffusion models. On the DrawBench and Open Image Preferences benchmark, our EA methods outperform state-of-the-art gradient-based and gradient-free inference-time methods. In terms of memory consumption, we require 55% to 76% lower GPU memory than gradient-based methods. In terms of running-time, we are 72% to 80% faster than gradient-based methods. We achieve higher alignment scores over 50 optimization steps on Open Image Preferences than gradient-based and gradient-free methods.

  Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for degradation systems is crucial in modern prognostic and health management (PHM). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be detected by assessing the uncertainty of model outputs, typically measured using entropy. Semantic entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address these limitations, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities. Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text summarization, and machine translation.

  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank updates to pretrained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global low-rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space-without increasing the total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved performance.

  Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.

  Rehearsal-based methods have shown superior performance in addressing catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) by storing and training on a subset of past data alongside new data in current task. While such a concurrent rehearsal strategy is widely used, it remains unclear if this approach is always optimal. Inspired by human learning, where sequentially revisiting tasks helps mitigate forgetting, we explore whether sequential rehearsal can offer greater benefits for CL compared to standard concurrent rehearsal. To address this question, we conduct a theoretical analysis of rehearsal-based CL in overparameterized linear models, comparing two strategies: 1) Concurrent Rehearsal, where past and new data are trained together, and 2) Sequential Rehearsal, where new data is trained first, followed by revisiting past data sequentially. By explicitly characterizing forgetting and generalization error, we show that sequential rehearsal performs better when tasks are less similar. These insights further motivate a novel Hybrid Rehearsal method, which trains similar tasks concurrently and revisits dissimilar tasks sequentially. We characterize its forgetting and generalization performance, and our experiments with deep neural networks further confirm that the hybrid approach outperforms standard concurrent rehearsal. This work provides the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of rehearsal-based CL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern AI development pipelines often involve multiple stages-pretraining, fine-tuning rounds, and subsequent adaptation or alignment-with numerous model update steps within each stage. This raises a critical question of accountability: when a deployed model succeeds or fails, which stage is responsible, and to what extent? We pose the problem of accountability attribution, which aims to trace model behavior back to specific stages of the training process. To address this, we propose a general framework that answers counterfactual questions about stage effects: how would the model behavior have changed if the updates from a training stage had not been executed?. Within this framework, we introduce estimators based on first-order approximations that efficiently quantify the stage effects without retraining. Our estimators account for both the training data and key aspects of optimization dynamics, including learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach identifies training stages accountable for specific behaviors, offering a practical tool for model analysis and a step toward more accountable AI development.

  Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) have predominantly assessed short-horizon, localized reasoning. Existing long-horizon suites (e.g. SWE-bench) rely on manually curated issues, so expanding or tuning difficulty demands expensive human effort and evaluations quickly saturate. However, many real-world tasks, such as software engineering or scientific research, require agents to rapidly comprehend and manipulate novel, complex structures dynamically; evaluating these capabilities requires the ability to construct large and varied sets of problems for agents to solve. We introduce Breakpoint, a benchmarking methodology that automatically generates code-repair tasks by adversarially corrupting functions within real-world software repositories. Breakpoint systematically controls task difficulty along two clear dimensions: local reasoning (characterized by code complexity metrics such as cyclomatic complexity) and system-level reasoning (characterized by call-graph centrality and the number of simultaneously corrupted interdependent functions). In experiments across more than 900 generated tasks we demonstrate that our methodology can scale to arbitrary difficulty, with state-of-the-art models' success rates ranging from 55% on the easiest tasks down to 0% on the hardest.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing paradigms for ensuring AI safety, such as guardrail models and alignment training, often compromise either inference efficiency or development flexibility. We introduce Disentangled Safety Adapters (DSA), a novel framework addressing these challenges by decoupling safety-specific computations from a task-optimized base model. DSA utilizes lightweight adapters that leverage the base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models, notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails). Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining 98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8 percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning. Overall, DSA presents a promising path towards more modular, efficient, and adaptable AI safety and alignment.

  _Eli Chien, Wei-Ning Chen, Pan Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zeroth-order optimization has emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning large language models on domain-specific data, particularly under differential privacy (DP) and memory constraints. While first-order methods have been extensively studied from a privacy perspective, the privacy analysis and algorithmic design for zeroth-order methods remain significantly underexplored. A critical open question concerns hidden-state DP analysis: although convergent privacy bounds are known for first-order methods, it has remained unclear whether similar guarantees can be established for zeroth-order methods. In this work, we provide an affirmative answer by proving a convergent DP bound for zeroth-order optimization. Our analysis generalizes the celebrated privacy amplification-by-iteration framework to the setting of smooth loss functions in zeroth-order optimization. Furthermore, it induces better DP zeroth-order algorithmic designs that are previously unknown to the literature.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion autoencoders (DAs) are variants of diffusion generative models that use an input-dependent latent variable to capture representations alongside the diffusion process. These representations, to varying extents, can be used for tasks such as downstream classification, controllable generation, and interpolation. However, the generative performance of DAs relies heavily on how well the latent variables can be modelled and subsequently sampled from. Better generative modelling is also the primary goal of another class of diffusion models -- those that learn their forward (noising) process. While effective at adjusting the noise process in an input-dependent manner, they must satisfy additional constraints derived from the terminal conditions of the diffusion process. Here, we draw a connection between these two classes of models and show that certain design decisions (latent variable choice, conditioning method, etc.) in the DA framework -- leading to a model we term DMZ -- allow us to obtain the best of both worlds: effective representations as evaluated on downstream tasks, including domain transfer, as well as more efficient modelling and generation with fewer denoising steps compared to standard DMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline-to-online deployment of reinforcement-learning (RL) agents must bridge two gaps: (1) the sim-to-real gap, where real systems add latency and other imperfections not present in simulation, and (2) the interaction gap, where policies trained purely offline face out-of-distribution states during online execution because gathering new interaction data is costly or risky. Agents therefore have to generalize from static, delay-free datasets to dynamic, delay-prone environments. Standard offline RL learns from delay-free logs yet must act under delays that break the Markov assumption and hurt performance. We introduce DT-CORL (Delay-Transformer belief policy Constrained Offline RL), an offline-RL framework built to cope with delayed dynamics at deployment. DT-CORL (i) produces delay-robust actions with a transformer-based belief predictor even though it never sees delayed observations during training, and (ii) is markedly more sample-efficient than na√Øve history-augmentation baselines. Experiments on D4RL benchmarks with several delay settings show that DT-CORL consistently outperforms both history-augmentation and vanilla belief-based methods, narrowing the sim-to-real latency gap while preserving data efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal fusion is susceptible to modality imbalance, where dominant modalities overshadow weak ones, easily leading to biased learning and suboptimal fusion, especially for incomplete modality conditions. To address this problem, we propose a Shapley-guided alternating training framework that adaptively prioritizes minor modalities to balance and thus enhance the fusion. Our method leverages Shapley Value-based scheduling to improve the training sequence adaptively, ensuring that under-optimized modalities receive sufficient learning. Additionally, we introduce the memory module to refine and inherit modality-specific representations with a cross-modal mapping mechanism to align features at both the feature and sample levels. To further validate the adaptability of the proposed approach, the encoder module empirically adopts both conventional and LLM-based backbones. With building up a novel multimodal equilibrium metric, namely, equilibrium deviation metric (EDM), we evaluate the performance in both balance and accuracy across four multimodal benchmark datasets, where our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Meanwhile, robustness analysis under missing modalities highlights its strong generalization capabilities. Accordingly, our findings reveal the untapped potential of alternating training, demonstrating that strategic modality prioritization fundamentally balances and promotes multimodal learning, offering a new paradigm for optimizing multimodal training dynamics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the most effective post-training approach for improving the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, because of the high demands on latency and memory, it is particularly challenging to develop an efficient RL framework that reliably manages policy models with hundreds to thousands of billions of parameters.In this paper, we present LlamaRL, a fully distributed, asynchronous RL framework optimized for efficient training of large-scale LLMs with various model sizes (8B, 70B, and 405B parameters) on GPU clusters ranging from a handful to thousands of devices. LlamaRL introduces a streamlined, single-controller architecture built entirely on native PyTorch, enabling modularity, ease of use, and seamless scalability to thousands of GPUs. We also provide a theoretical analysis of LlamaRL's efficiency, including a formal proof that its asynchronous design leads to strict RL speed-up. Empirically during the Llama 3 post-training, by leveraging best practices such as colocated model offloading, asynchronous off-policy training, and distributed direct memory access for weight synchronization, LlamaRL achieves significant efficiency gains -- up to 10.7x speed-up compared to DeepSpeed-Chat-like systems on a 405B-parameter policy model. Furthermore, the efficiency advantage continues to grow with increasing model scale, demonstrating the framework's suitability for future large-scale RL training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have found success by using powerful probabilistic models, such as transformers, energy-based models, and diffusion/flow-based models. To this end, RL researchers often choose to pay the price of accommodating these models into their algorithms -- diffusion models are expressive, but are computationally intensive due to their reliance on solving differential equations, while autoregressive transformer models are scalable but typically require learning discrete representations. Normalizing flows (NFs), by contrast, seem to provide an appealing alternative, as they enable likelihoods and sampling without solving differential equations or autoregressive architectures. However, their potential in RL has received limited attention, partly due to the prevailing belief that normalizing flows lack sufficient expressivity. We show that this is not the case. Building on recent work in NFs, we propose a single NF architecture which integrates seamlessly into RL algorithms, serving as a policy, Q-function, and occupancy measure. Our approach leads to much simpler algorithms, and achieves higher performance in imitation learning, offline, goal conditioned RL and unsupervised RL.

  Speaker-dependent modelling can substantially improve performance in speech-based health monitoring applications. While mixed-effect models are commonly used for such speaker adaptation, they require computationally expensive retraining for each new observation, making them impractical in a production environment. We reformulate this task as a meta-learning problem and explore three approaches of increasing complexity: ensemble-based distance models, prototypical networks, and transformer-based sequence models. Using pre-trained speech embeddings, we evaluate these methods on a large longitudinal dataset of shift workers (N=1,185, 10,286 recordings), predicting time since sleep from speech as a function of fatigue, a symptom commonly associated with ill-health. Our results demonstrate that all meta-learning approaches tested outperformed both cross-sectional and conventional mixed-effects models, with a transformer-based method achieving the strongest performance.

  Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving serving constraints, which requires significant resources for model development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary datasets and models. Its practical efficacy is underscored by live A/B tests within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric. We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve relative improvements of over 24% on SAT Math and over 10% on the LAMBADA benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Variable binding -- the ability to associate variables with values -- is fundamental to symbolic computation and cognition. Although classical architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and (3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support, bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches. To facilitate reproducible research, we developed Variable Scope, an interactive web platform for exploring our findings atthis https URL

Our result also implies an improved high-probability regret bound for the bandit linear optimization, a special case with no perturbation. We also give a lower bound on the expected regret.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of offline imitation learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the goal is to learn a well-performing policy given a dataset of state-action pairs generated by an expert policy. Complementing a recent line of work on this topic that assumes the expert belongs to a tractable class of known policies, we approach this problem from a new angle and leverage a different type of structural assumption about the environment. Specifically, for the class of linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs, we introduce a new algorithm called saddle-point offline imitation learning (\SPOIL), which is guaranteed to match the performance of any expert up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ with access to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples. Moreover, we extend this result to possibly non-linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs at the cost of a worse sample complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$. Finally, our analysis suggests a new loss function for training critic networks from expert data in deep imitation learning. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the neural net implementation of \SPOIL is superior to behavior cloning and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.

  Zero-shot streaming text-to-speech is an important research topic in human-computer interaction. Existing methods primarily use a lookahead mechanism, relying on future text to achieve natural streaming speech synthesis, which introduces high processing latency. To address this issue, we propose SMLLE, a streaming framework for generating high-quality speech frame-by-frame. SMLLE employs a Transducer to convert text into semantic tokens in real time while simultaneously obtaining duration alignment information. The combined outputs are then fed into a fully autoregressive (AR) streaming model to reconstruct mel-spectrograms. To further stabilize the generation process, we design a Delete < Bos > Mechanism that allows the AR model to access future text introducing as minimal delay as possible. Experimental results suggest that the SMLLE outperforms current streaming TTS methods and achieves comparable performance over sentence-level TTS systems. Samples are available onthis http URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore, we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world molecular conformer generation.

  Post-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However, existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g., perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy), ignoring the agentic capabilities - workflow, tool use/function call, long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how compression impacts LLMs' agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1) 12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation, Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ) and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B), standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves workflow generation and tool use (1%-3% drop) but degrades real-world application accuracy by 10%-15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world medical data often includes measurements from multiple signals that are collected at irregular and asynchronous time intervals. For example, different types of blood tests can be measured at different times and frequencies, resulting in fragmented and unevenly scattered temporal data. Similar issues of irregular sampling of different attributes occur in other domains, such as monitoring of large systems using event log files or the spread of fake news on social networks. Effectively learning from such data requires models that can handle sets of temporally sparse and heterogeneous signals. In this paper, we propose Graph Mixing Additive Networks (GMAN), a novel and interpretable-by-design model for learning over irregular sets of temporal signals. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world medical tasks, including a 4-point increase in the AUROC score of in-hospital mortality prediction, compared to existing methods. We further showcase GMAN's flexibility by applying it to a fake news detection task. We demonstrate how its interpretability capabilities, including node-level, graph-level, and subset-level importance, allow for transition phases detection and gaining medical insights with real-world high-stakes implications. Finally, we provide theoretical insights on GMAN expressive power.

  Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (this https URL).

  Child literacy is a strong predictor of life outcomes at the subsequent stages of an individual's life. This points to a need for targeted interventions in vulnerable low and middle income populations to help bridge the gap between literacy levels in these regions and high income ones. In this effort, reading assessments provide an important tool to measure the effectiveness of these programs and AI can be a reliable and economical tool to support educators with this task. Developing accurate automatic reading assessment systems for child speech in low-resource languages poses significant challenges due to limited data and the unique acoustic properties of children's voices. This study focuses on Xhosa, a language spoken in South Africa, to advance child speech recognition capabilities. We present a novel dataset composed of child speech samples in Xhosa. The dataset is available upon request and contains ten words and letters, which are part of the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) system. Each recording is labeled with an online and cost-effective approach by multiple markers and a subsample is validated by an independent EGRA reviewer. This dataset is evaluated with three fine-tuned state-of-the-art end-to-end models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and Whisper. The results indicate that the performance of these models can be significantly influenced by the amount and balancing of the available training data, which is fundamental for cost-effective large dataset collection. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that the wav2vec 2.0 performance is improved by training on multiple classes at a time, even when the number of available samples is constrained.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate exceptional capability in tackling complex mathematical, logical, and coding tasks by leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Test-time scaling methods, such as prolonging CoT with explicit token-level exploration, can push LRMs' accuracy boundaries, but they incur significant decoding overhead. A key inefficiency source is LRMs often generate redundant thinking CoTs, which demonstrate clear structured overthinking and underthinking patterns. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning processes and numerical optimization theories, we propose TrimR, a verifier-based, training-free, efficient framework for dynamic CoT compression to trim reasoning and enhance test-time scaling, explicitly tailored for production-level deployment. Our method employs a lightweight, pretrained, instruction-tuned verifier to detect and truncate redundant intermediate thoughts of LRMs without any LRM or verifier fine-tuning. We present both the core algorithm and asynchronous online system engineered for high-throughput industrial applications. Empirical evaluations on Ascend NPUs and vLLM show that our framework delivers substantial gains in inference efficiency under large-batch workloads. In particular, on the four MATH500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA benchmarks, the reasoning runtime of Pangu Pro MoE, Pangu-R-38B, QwQ-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B is improved by up to 70% with negligible impact on accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have been observed to suddenly exhibit advanced reasoning abilities during reinforcement learning (RL), resembling an ``aha moment'' triggered by simple outcome-based rewards. While RL has proven effective in eliciting such breakthroughs in tasks involving mathematics, coding, and vision, it faces significant challenges in multi-scenario games. The diversity of game rules, interaction modes, and environmental complexities often leads to policies that perform well in one scenario but fail to generalize to others. Simply combining multiple scenarios during training introduces additional challenges, such as training instability and poor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Divide-Fuse-Conquer, a framework designed to enhance generalization in multi-scenario RL. This approach starts by heuristically grouping games based on characteristics such as rules and difficulties. Specialized models are then trained for each group to excel at games in the group is what we refer to as the divide step. Next, we fuse model parameters from different groups as a new model, and continue training it for multiple groups, until the scenarios in all groups are conquered. Experiments across 18 TextArena games show that Qwen2.5-32B-Align trained with the Divide-Fuse-Conquer strategy reaches a performance level comparable to Claude3.5, achieving 7 wins and 4 draws. We hope our approach can inspire future research on using reinforcement learning to improve the generalization of LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Auto-regressive partial differential equation (PDE) foundation models have shown great potential in handling time-dependent data. However, these models suffer from the shortcut problem deeply rooted in auto-regressive prediction, causing error accumulation. The challenge becomes particularly evident for out-of-distribution data, as the pretraining performance may approach random model initialization for downstream tasks with long-term dynamics. To deal with this problem, we propose physics-informed temporal alignment (PITA), a self-supervised learning framework inspired by inverse problem solving. Specifically, PITA aligns the physical dynamics discovered at different time steps on each given PDE trajectory by integrating physics-informed constraints into the self-supervision signal. The alignment is derived from observation data without relying on known physics priors, indicating strong generalization ability to the out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments show that PITA significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of existing foundation models on diverse time-dependent PDE data. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training quantization is a key technique for reducing the memory and inference latency of large language models by quantizing weights and activations without requiring retraining. However, existing methods either (1) fail to account for the varying importance of hidden features to the end loss or, when incorporating end loss, (2) neglect the critical interactions between model weights. To address these limitations, we propose GuidedQuant, a novel quantization approach that integrates gradient information from the end loss into the quantization objective while preserving cross-weight dependencies within output channels. GuidedQuant consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art quantization methods across weight-only scalar, weight-only vector, and weight-and-activation quantization. Additionally, we introduce a novel non-uniform scalar quantization algorithm, which is guaranteed to monotonically decrease the quantization objective value, and outperforms existing methods in this category. We release the code atthis https URL.

  The proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse downstream tasks necessitates efficient model selection, given the impracticality of fine-tuning all candidates due to computational constraints. Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods.

  Traditional domain generalization approaches predominantly focus on leveraging target domain-aware features while overlooking the critical role of source domain-specific characteristics, particularly in federated settings with inherent data isolation. To address this gap, we propose the Federated Source Domain Awareness Framework (FedSDAF), the first method to systematically exploit source domain-aware features for enhanced federated domain generalization (FedDG). The FedSDAF framework consists of two synergistic components: the Domain-Invariant Adapter, which preserves critical domain-invariant features, and the Domain-Aware Adapter, which extracts and integrates source domain-specific knowledge using a Multihead Self-Attention mechanism (MHSA). Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional knowledge distillation mechanism that fosters knowledge sharing among clients while safeguarding privacy. Our approach represents the first systematic exploitation of source domain-aware features, resulting in significant advancements in model generalizationthis http URLexperiments on four standard benchmarks (OfficeHome, PACS, VLCS, and DomainNet) show that our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art federated domain generalization approaches, with accuracy gains of 5.2-13.8%.

  Medical audio signals, such as heart and lung sounds, play a crucial role in clinical diagnosis. However, analyzing these signals remains challenging: traditional methods rely on handcrafted features or supervised deep learning models that demand extensive labeled datasets, limiting their scalability and applicability. To address these issues, we propose CaReAQA, an audio-language model that integrates a foundation audio model with the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling clinically relevant, open-ended diagnostic responses. Alongside CaReAQA, we introduce CaReSound, a benchmark dataset of annotated medical audio recordings enriched with metadata and paired question-answer examples, intended to drive progress in diagnostic reasoning research. Evaluation results show that CaReAQA achieves 86.2% accuracy on open-ended diagnostic reasoning tasks, outperforming baseline models. It also generalizes well to closed-ended classification tasks, achieving an average accuracy of 56.9% on unseen datasets. Our findings show how audio-language integration and reasoning advances medical diagnostics, enabling efficient AI systems for clinical decision support.

  Recent studies indicate that deep neural networks degrade in generalization performance under noisy supervision. Existing methods focus on isolating clean subsets or correcting noisy labels, facing limitations such as high computational costs, heavy hyperparameter tuning process, and coarse-grained optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage noisy learning framework that enables instance-level optimization through a dynamically weighted loss function, avoiding hyperparameter tuning. To obtain stable and accurate information about noise modeling, we introduce a simple yet effective metric, termed wrong event, which dynamically models the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples while maintaining computational costs. Our framework first collects wrong event information and builds a strong base model. Then we perform noise-robust training on the base model, using a probabilistic model to handle the wrong event information of samples. Experiments on five synthetic and real-world LNL benchmarks demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance, achieves a nearly 75% reduction in computational time and improves model scalability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a parameter collaborative optimization algorithm for large language models, enhanced with graph spectral analysis. The goal is to improve both fine-tuning efficiency and structural awareness during training. In the proposed method, the parameters of a pre-trained language model are treated as nodes in a graph. A weighted graph is constructed, and Laplacian spectral decomposition is applied to enable frequency-domain modeling and structural representation of the parameter space. Based on this structure, a joint loss function is designed. It combines the task loss with a spectral regularization term to facilitate collaborative updates among parameters. In addition, a spectral filtering mechanism is introduced during the optimization phase. This mechanism adjusts gradients in a structure-aware manner, enhancing the model's training stability and convergence behavior. The method is evaluated on multiple tasks, including traditional fine-tuning comparisons, few-shot generalization tests, and convergence speed analysis. In all settings, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance. The experimental results confirm that the spectral collaborative optimization framework effectively reduces parameter perturbations and improves fine-tuning quality while preserving overall model performance. This work contributes significantly to the field of artificial intelligence by advancing parameter-efficient training methodologies for large-scale models, reinforcing the importance of structural signal processing in deep learning optimization, and offering a robust, generalizable framework for enhancing language model adaptability and performance.

  Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold2. Despite these developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions. Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

  Multi-label Recognition (MLR) involves assigning multiple labels to each data instance in an image, offering advantages over single-label classification in complex scenarios. However, it faces the challenge of annotating all relevant categories, often leading to uncertain annotations, such as unseen or incomplete labels. Recent Vision and Language Pre-training (VLP) based methods have made significant progress in tackling zero-shot MLR tasks by leveraging rich vision-language correlations. However, the correlation between multi-label semantics has not been fully explored, and the learned visual features often lack essential semantic information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Semantic-guided Representation Learning approach (SigRL) that enables the model to learn effective visual and textual representations, thereby improving the downstream alignment of visual images and categories. Specifically, we first introduce a graph-based multi-label correlation module (GMC) to facilitate information exchange between labels, enriching the semantic representation across the multi-label texts. Next, we propose a Semantic Visual Feature Reconstruction module (SVFR) to enhance the semantic information in the visual representation by integrating the learned textual representation during reconstruction. Finally, we optimize the image-text matching capability of the VLP model using both local and global features to achieve zero-shot MLR. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several MLR benchmarks, encompassing both zero-shot MLR (with unseen labels) and single positive multi-label learning (with limited labels), demonstrating the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular technique for interpreting language model activations, and there is extensive recent work on improving SAE effectiveness. However, most prior work evaluates progress using unsupervised proxy metrics with unclear practical relevance. We introduce SAEBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures SAE performance across eight diverse metrics, spanning interpretability, feature disentanglement and practical applications like unlearning. To enable systematic comparison, we open-source a suite of over 200 SAEs across eight recently proposed SAE architectures and training algorithms. Our evaluation reveals that gains on proxy metrics do not reliably translate to better practical performance. For instance, while Matryoshka SAEs slightly underperform on existing proxy metrics, they substantially outperform other architectures on feature disentanglement metrics; moreover, this advantage grows with SAE scale. By providing a standardized framework for measuring progress in SAE development, SAEBench enables researchers to study scaling trends and make nuanced comparisons between different SAE architectures and training methodologies. Our interactive interface enables researchers to flexibly visualize relationships between metrics across hundreds of open-source SAEs at:this http URL

  Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising approach for NP-hard problems. However, prevailing RL-based methods suffer from low sample efficiency due to sparse rewards and underused solutions. We propose Best-anchored and Objective-guided Preference Optimization (BOPO), a training paradigm that leverages solution preferences via objective values. It introduces: (1) a best-anchored preference pair construction for better explore and exploit solutions, and (2) an objective-guided pairwise loss function that adaptively scales gradients via objective differences, removing reliance on reward models or reference policies. Experiments on Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP), Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) show BOPO outperforms state-of-the-art neural methods, reducing optimality gaps impressively with efficient inference. BOPO is architecture-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with existing NCO models, and establishes preference optimization as a principled framework for combinatorial optimization.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal accuracy impact. However, existing methods often suffer from accuracy degradation without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Moreover, despite updating weights with regional optimization, Wanda++ remains orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, further reducing perplexity with LoRA in great extend. Our approach is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single H100 GPU.

  Concept-based models are an emerging paradigm in deep learning that constrains the inference process to operate through human-interpretable variables, facilitating explainability and human interaction. However, these architectures, on par with popular opaque neural models, fail to account for the true causal mechanisms underlying the target phenomena represented in the data. This hampers their ability to support causal reasoning tasks, limits out-of-distribution generalization, and hinders the implementation of fairness constraints. To overcome these issues, we propose Causally reliable Concept Bottleneck Models (C$^2$BMs), a class of concept-based architectures that enforce reasoning through a bottleneck of concepts structured according to a model of the real-world causal mechanisms. We also introduce a pipeline to automatically learn this structure from observational data and unstructured background knowledge (e.g., scientific literature). Experimental evidence suggests that C$^2$BMs are more interpretable, causally reliable, and improve responsiveness to interventions w.r.t. standard opaque and concept-based models, while maintaining their accuracy.

  Large Reasoning Models(LRMs) such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities by scaling test-time compute and generating long Chain-of-Thought(CoT). Distillation--post-training on LRMs-generated data--is a straightforward yet effective method to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models, but faces a critical bottleneck: we found that distilled long CoT data poses learning difficulty for small models and leads to the inheritance of biases (i.e. over-thinking) when using Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose constructing tree-based CoT data from scratch via Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS). We then exploit a set of CoT-aware approaches, including Thoughts Length Balance, Fine-grained DPO, and Joint Post-training Objective, to enhance SFT and RL on the constructed data. We conduct evaluation on various benchmarks such as math (GSM8K, MATH, AIME). instruction-following (Multi-IF) and planning (Blocksworld), results demonstrate our approaches substantially improve the reasoning performance of distilled models compared to standard distilled models via reducing the hallucinations in long-time thinking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have become the backbone of modern natural language processing but pose privacy concerns about leaking sensitive training data. Membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a sample is included in a model's training dataset, can serve as a foundation for broader privacy threats. Existing defenses designed for traditional classification models do not account for the sequential nature of text data. As a result, they either require significant computational resources or fail to effectively mitigate privacy risks in LLMs. In this work, we propose \methodname, a lightweight yet effective empirical privacy defense for protecting training data of language models by leveraging token-specific characteristics. By analyzing token dynamics during training, we propose a token selection strategy that categorizes tokens into hard tokens for learning and memorized tokens for unlearning. Subsequently, our training-phase defense optimizes a novel dual-purpose token-level loss to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between utility and privacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only provides strong protection against MIAs but also improves language modeling performance by around 10\% across various LLM architectures and datasets compared to the baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale physical systems defined on irregular grids pose significant scalability challenges for deep learning methods, especially in the presence of long-range interactions and multi-scale coupling. Traditional approaches that compute all pairwise interactions, such as attention, become computationally prohibitive as they scale quadratically with the number of nodes. We present Erwin, a hierarchical transformer inspired by methods from computational many-body physics, which combines the efficiency of tree-based algorithms with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Erwin employs ball tree partitioning to organize computation, which enables linear-time attention by processing nodes in parallel within local neighborhoods of fixed size. Through progressive coarsening and refinement of the ball tree structure, complemented by a novel cross-ball interaction mechanism, it captures both fine-grained local details and global features. We demonstrate Erwin's effectiveness across multiple domains, including cosmology, molecular dynamics, PDE solving, and particle fluid dynamics, where it consistently outperforms baseline methods both in accuracy and computational efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to reduce overconfidence in neural network predictions and improve generalization. Despite these benefits, recent studies reveal two critical issues with LS. First, LS induces overconfidence in misclassified samples. Second, it compacts feature representations into overly tight clusters, diluting intra-class diversity, although the precise cause of this phenomenon remained elusive. In this paper, we analytically decompose the LS-induced loss, exposing two key terms: (i) a regularization term that dampens overconfidence only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-amplification term that arises under misclassifications. This latter term compels the network to reinforce incorrect predictions with undue certainty, exacerbating representation collapse. To address these shortcomings, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which applies uniform regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit rather than the ground-truth logit. Through extensive feature-space analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Experiments on large-scale image classification and multiple downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS, consistently reducing overconfidence while preserving richer feature representations.

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) provides a cost-effective solution by approximating weight updates through low-rank matrices. In real-world scenarios, LLMs are fine-tuned on data from multiple domains to perform tasks across various fields, embodying multi-task learning (MTL). LoRA often underperforms in such complex scenarios. To enhance LoRA's capability in multi-task learning, we propose R-LoRA, which incorporates Multi-Head Randomization. Multi-Head Randomization diversifies the head matrices through Multi-Head Dropout and Multi-Head Random Initialization, enabling more efficient learning of task-specific features while maintaining shared knowledge representation. Our approach not only improves performance in MTL but also reduces GPU memory usage and training time. Experiments show that R-LoRA's gains stem from increased diversity in the head matrices, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-task learning. The code is available atthis https URL

Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.

  Evaluating models on large benchmarks is very resource-intensive, especially during the period of rapid model evolution. Existing efficient evaluation methods estimate the performance of target models by testing them only on a small and static coreset of the benchmark, which is derived from the publicly available evaluation results of source models. These methods rely on the assumption that target models have high prediction consistency with source models. However, we demonstrate that it doesn't generalize well in practice. To alleviate the inconsistency issue, we present TailoredBench, a method that conducts customized evaluation tailored to each target model. Specifically, a Global-coreset is first constructed as a probe to identify the most consistent source models for each target model with an adaptive source model selection strategy. Afterwards, a scalable K-Medoids clustering algorithm is proposed to extend the Global-coreset to a tailored Native-coreset for each target model. According to the predictions on Native-coresets, we obtain the performance of target models on the whole benchmark with a calibrated estimation strategy. Comprehensive experiments on 5 benchmarks across over 300 models demonstrate that compared to best performing baselines, TailoredBench achieves an average reduction of 31.4% in MAE of accuracy estimates under the same inference budgets, showcasing strong effectiveness and generalizability.

  Active Learning (AL) has been a powerful paradigm for improving model efficiency and performance by selecting the most informative data points for labeling and training. In recent active learning frameworks, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed not only for selection but also for generating entirely new data instances and providing more cost-effective annotations. Motivated by the increasing importance of high-quality data and efficient model training in the era of LLMs, we present a comprehensive survey on LLM-based Active Learning. We introduce an intuitive taxonomy that categorizes these techniques and discuss the transformative roles LLMs can play in the active learning loop. We further examine the impact of AL on LLM learning paradigms and its applications across various domains. Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research directions. This survey aims to serve as an up-to-date resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to gain an intuitive understanding of LLM-based AL techniques and deploy them to new applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  User information needs are often highly diverse and varied. A key challenge in current research is how to achieve controllable multi-objective generation while enabling rapid adaptation to accommodate diverse user demands during test time. Existing solutions, such as Rewarded Soup, focus on merging language models individually tuned on single objectives. While easy to implement and widely used, these approaches face limitations in achieving optimal performance due to their disregard for the impacts of competing objectives on model tuning. To address this issue, we propose Bone Soup, a novel model merging approach that first seeks a series of backbone models by considering the impacts of multiple objectives and then makes the soup (i.e., merge the backbone models). Specifically, Bone Soup begins by training multiple backbone models for different objectives using multi-objective reinforcement learning. Each backbone model is guided by a combination of backbone reward signals. To ensure that these models are optimal for the Pareto front, the backbone rewards are crafted by combining standard reward functions into basis vectors, which can then be modified through a rule-based construction method. Bone Soup leverages a symmetric circulant matrix mapping to generate the merging coefficients, which are used to merge the backbone models according to user preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Bone Soup exhibits strong controllability and Pareto optimality in controllable multi-objective generation, providing a more effective and efficient approach to addressing diverse user needs at test time.

  Graph transformers extend global self-attention to graph-structured data, achieving notable success in graph learning. Recently, random walk structural encoding (RWSE) has been found to further enhance their predictive power by encoding both structural and positional information into the edge representation. However, RWSE cannot always distinguish between edges that belong to different local graph patterns, which reduces its ability to capture the full structural complexity of graphs. This work introduces Simple Path Structural Encoding (SPSE), a novel method that utilizes simple path counts for edge encoding. We show theoretically and experimentally that SPSE overcomes the limitations of RWSE, providing a richer representation of graph structures, particularly for capturing local cyclic patterns. To make SPSE computationally tractable, we propose an efficient approximate algorithm for simple path counting. SPSE demonstrates significant performance improvements over RWSE on various benchmarks, including molecular and long-range graph datasets, achieving statistically significant gains in discriminative tasks. These results pose SPSE as a powerful edge encoding alternative for enhancing the expressivity of graph transformers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority of the nodes in a graph, which has been attracting significant attention in recent years. Existing generalist graph models have achieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize to the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning generalized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and heterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address this challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model that supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse graph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for normal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD across different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align data-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node representation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its neighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into a unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of nodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force for the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal and abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs, including very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes available in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to leverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero- and few-shot GAD settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While many advances in time series models focus exclusively on numerical data, research on multimodal time series, particularly those involving contextual textual information commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, remains in its infancy. With recent progress in large language models and time series learning, we revisit the integration of paired texts with time series through the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that representations of different modalities converge to shared spaces. In this context, we identify that time-series-paired texts may naturally exhibit periodic properties that closely mirror those of the original time series. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, Texts as Time Series (TaTS), which considers the time-series-paired texts to be auxiliary variables of the time series. TaTS can be plugged into any existing numerical-only time series models and enable them to handle time series data with paired texts effectively. Through extensive experiments on both multimodal time series forecasting and imputation tasks across benchmark datasets with various existing time series models, we demonstrate that TaTS can enhance predictive performance without modifying model architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider the privacy amplification properties of a sampling scheme in which a user's data is used in $k$ steps chosen randomly and uniformly from a sequence (or set) of $t$ steps. This sampling scheme has been recently applied in the context of differentially private optimization [Chua et al., 2024a, Choquette-Choo et al., 2024] and is also motivated by communication-efficient high-dimensional private aggregation [Asi et al., 2025]. Existing analyses of this scheme either rely on privacy amplification by shuffling which leads to overly conservative bounds or require Monte Carlo simulations that are computationally prohibitive in most practical scenarios.We give the first theoretical guarantees and numerical estimation algorithms for this sampling scheme. In particular, we demonstrate that the privacy guarantees of random $k$-out-of-$t$ allocation can be upper bounded by the privacy guarantees of the well-studied independent (or Poisson) subsampling in which each step uses the user's data with probability $(1+o(1))k/t$. Further, we provide two additional analysis techniques that lead to numerical improvements in several parameter regimes. Altogether, our bounds give efficiently-computable and nearly tight numerical results for random allocation applied to Gaussian noise addition.

  This paper introduces the concept of coexistence for embodied artificial agents and argues that it is a prerequisite for long-term, in-the-wild interaction with humans. Contemporary embodied artificial agents excel in static, predefined tasks but fall short in dynamic and long-term interactions with humans. On the other hand, humans can adapt and evolve continuously, exploiting the situated knowledge embedded in their environment and other agents, thus contributing to meaningful interactions. We take an interdisciplinary approach at different levels of organization, drawing from biology and design theory, to understand how human and non-human organisms foster entities that coexist within their specific environments. Finally, we propose key research directions for the artificial intelligence community to develop coexisting embodied agents, focusing on the principles, hardware and learning methods responsible for shaping them.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is generally more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 21.25\% compared with KIVI-KV8 quantization over various context lengths. Our code and searched configurations are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The accurate prediction of drug responses remains a formidable challenge, particularly at the single-cell level and in clinical treatment contexts. Some studies employ transfer learning techniques to predict drug responses in individual cells and patients, but they require access to target-domain data during training, which is often unavailable or only obtainable in future. In this study, we propose a novel domain generalization framework, termed FourierDrug, to address this challenge. Given the extracted feature from expression profile, we performed Fourier transforms and then introduced an asymmetric attention constraint that would cluster drug-sensitive samples into a compact group while drives resistant samples dispersed in the frequency domain. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that our model effectively learns task-relevant features from diverse source domains, and achieves accurate predictions of drug response for unseen cancer type. When evaluated on single-cell and patient-level drug response prediction tasks, FourierDrug--trained solely on in vitro cell line data without access to target-domain data--consistently outperforms or, at least, matched the performance of current state-of-the-art methods. These findings underscore the potential of our method for real-world clinical applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inspired by human SYSTEM 2 thinking, LLMs excel at complex reasoning tasks via extended Chain-of-Thought. However, similar test-time scaling for diffusion models to tackle complex reasoning remains largely unexplored. From existing work, two primary challenges emerge in this setting: (i) the dependence on an external verifier indicating a notable gap from intrinsic reasoning of human intelligence without any external feedback, and (ii) the lack of an efficient search algorithm. In this paper, we introduce the Verifier-free Test-time Scalable Diffusion Model (VFScale) to achieve scalable intrinsic reasoning, which equips number-of-sample test-time scaling with the intrinsic energy function of diffusion models as the verifier. Concretely, VFScale comprises two key innovations to address the aforementioned challenges. On the training side, VFScale consists of a novel LRNCL loss and a KL regularization to improve the energy landscape, ensuring that the learned energy function itself serves as a reliable verifier. On the inference side, VFScale integrates the denoising process with a novel hybrid Monte Carlo Tree Search (hMCTS) to improve search efficiency. On challenging reasoning tasks of Maze and Sudoku, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VFScale's training objective and scalable inference method. In particular, trained with Maze sizes of up to $6\times6$, our VFScale solves 88% of Maze problems with much larger sizes of $15\times15$, while standard diffusion model completely fails.

  We present an approach to model-based RL that achieves a new state of the art performance on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, an open-world 2D survival game that requires agents to exhibit a wide range of general abilities -- such as strong generalization, deep exploration, and long-term reasoning. With a series of careful design choices aimed at improving sample efficiency, our MBRL algorithm achieves a reward of 69.66% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and, for the first time, exceeds human performance of 65.0%. Our method starts by constructing a SOTA model-free baseline, using a novel policy architecture that combines CNNs and RNNs. We then add three improvements to the standard MBRL setup: (a) "Dyna with warmup", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, (b) "nearest neighbor tokenizer" on image patches, which improves the scheme to create the transformer world model (TWM) inputs, and (c) "block teacher forcing", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep.

  The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in their reasoning capabilities, hold transformative potential for addressing complex challenges in atmospheric science. However, leveraging LLMs effectively in this domain requires a robust and comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Toward this end, we present AtmosSci-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess LLM performance across five core categories of atmospheric science problems: hydrology, atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and physical oceanography. AtmosSci-Bench features a dual-format design comprising both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and open-ended questions (OEQs), enabling scalable automated evaluation alongside deeper analysis of conceptual understanding. We employ a template-based MCQ generation framework to create diverse, graduate-level problems with symbolic perturbation, while OEQs are used to probe open-ended reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative LLMs, categorized into four groups: instruction-tuned models, advanced reasoning models, math-augmented models, and domain-specific climate models. Our analysis provides some interesting insights into the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in atmospheric science. We believe AtmosSci-Bench can serve as a critical step toward advancing LLM applications in climate service by offering a standard and rigorous evaluation framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structural causal models (SCMs) allow us to investigate complex systems at multiple levels of resolution. The causal abstraction (CA) framework formalizes the mapping between high- and low-level SCMs. We address CA learning in a challenging and realistic setting, where SCMs are inaccessible, interventional data is unavailable, and sample data is misaligned. A key principle of our framework is semantic embedding, formalized as the high-level distribution lying on a subspace of the low-level one. This principle naturally links linear CA to the geometry of the Stiefel manifold. We present a category-theoretic approach to SCMs that enables the learning of a CA by finding a morphism between the low- and high-level probability measures, adhering to the semantic embedding principle. Consequently, we formulate a general CA learning problem. As an application, we solve the latter problem for linear CA; considering Gaussian measures and the Kullback-Leibler divergence as an objective. Given the nonconvexity of the learning task, we develop three algorithms building upon existing paradigms for Riemannian optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed methods succeed on both synthetic and real-world brain data with different degrees of prior information about the structure of CA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.

  Dynamic sparse training (DST) can reduce the computational demands in ANNs, but faces difficulties in keeping peak performance at high sparsity levels. The Cannistraci-Hebb training (CHT) is a brain-inspired method for growing connectivity in DST. CHT leverages a gradient-free, topology-driven link regrowth, which has shown ultra-sparse (less than 1% connectivity) advantage across various tasks compared to fully connected networks. Yet, CHT suffers two main drawbacks: (i) its time complexity is $O(Nd^3)$ - N node network size, d node degree - restricting it to ultra-sparse regimes. (ii) it selects top link prediction scores, which is inappropriate for the early training epochs, when the network presents unreliable connections. Here, we design the first brain-inspired network model - termed bipartite receptive field (BRF) - to initialize the connectivity of sparse artificial neural networks. We further introduce a GPU-friendly matrix-based approximation of CH link prediction, reducing complexity to $O(N^3)$. We introduce the Cannistraci-Hebb training soft rule (CHTs), which adopts a flexible strategy for sampling connections in both link removal and regrowth, balancing the exploration and exploitation of network topology. Additionally, we integrate CHTs with a sigmoid gradual density decay (CHTss). Empirical results show that BRF offers performance advantages over previous network science models. Using 1% of connections, CHTs outperforms fully connected networks in MLP architectures on image classification tasks, compressing some networks to less than 30% of the nodes. Using 5% of the connections, CHTss outperforms fully connected networks in two Transformer-based machine translation tasks. Finally, at 30% connectivity, both CHTs and CHTss outperform other DST methods in language modeling and even exceed fully connected baselines in zero-shot tasks.

  Tabular data is widely utilized in various machine learning tasks. Current tabular learning research predominantly focuses on closed environments, while in real-world applications, open environments are often encountered, where distribution and feature shifts occur, leading to significant degradation in model performance. Previous research has primarily concentrated on mitigating distribution shifts, whereas feature shifts, a distinctive and unexplored challenge of tabular data, have garnered limited attention. To this end, this paper conducts the first comprehensive study on feature shifts in tabular data and introduces the first tabular feature-shift benchmark (TabFSBench). TabFSBench evaluates impacts of four distinct feature-shift scenarios on four tabular model categories across various datasets and assesses the performance of large language models (LLMs) and tabular LLMs in the tabular benchmark for the first time. Our study demonstrates three main observations: (1) most tabular models have the limited applicability in feature-shift scenarios; (2) the shifted feature set importance has a linear relationship with model performance degradation; (3) model performance in closed environments correlates with feature-shift performance. Future research direction is also explored for each observation.Benchmark:this https URL.

  Interpretability is crucial for ensuring RL systems align with human values. However, it remains challenging to achieve in complex decision making domains. Existing methods frequently attempt interpretability at the level of fundamental model units, such as neurons or decision nodes: an approach which scales poorly to large models. Here, we instead propose an approach to interpretability at the level of functional modularity. We show how encouraging sparsity and locality in network weights leads to the emergence of functional modules in RL policy networks. To detect these modules, we develop an extended Louvain algorithm which uses a novel `correlation alignment' metric to overcome the limitations of standard network analysis techniques when applied to neural network architectures. Applying these methods to 2D and 3D MiniGrid environments reveals the consistent emergence of distinct navigational modules for different axes, and we further demonstrate how these functions can be validated through direct interventions on network weights prior to inference.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer computationally efficient adaptations of Large Language Models (LLMs), their practical deployment often assumes centralized data and training environments. However, real-world scenarios frequently involve distributed, privacy-sensitive datasets that require decentralized solutions. Federated learning (FL) addresses data privacy by coordinating model updates across clients, but it is typically based on centralized aggregation through a parameter server, which can introduce bottlenecks and communication constraints. Decentralized learning, in contrast, eliminates this dependency by enabling direct collaboration between clients, improving scalability and efficiency in distributed environments. Despite its advantages, decentralized LLM fine-tuning remains underexplored. In this work, we propose Dec-LoRA, a decentralized fine-tuning algorithm for LLMs based on LoRA. Through extensive experiments on BERT and LLaMA-2 models, we demonstrate that Dec-LoRA achieves performance comparable to centralized LoRA under various conditions, including data heterogeneity and quantization constraints. Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical guarantee proving the convergence of our algorithm to a stationary point for non-convex and smooth loss functions. These findings highlight the potential of Dec-LoRA for scalable LLM fine-tuning in decentralized environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid increase in the parameter counts of Large Language Models (LLMs), reaching billions or even trillions, presents significant challenges for their practical deployment, particularly in resource-constrained environments. To ease this issue, we propose PIP (Perturbation-based Iterative Pruning), a novel double-view structured pruning method to optimize LLMs, which combines information from two different views: the unperturbed view and the perturbed view. With the calculation of gradient differences, PIP iteratively prunes those that struggle to distinguish between these two views. Our experiments show that PIP reduces the parameter count by approximately 20% while retaining over 85% of the original model's accuracy across varied benchmarks. In some cases, the performance of the pruned model is within 5% of the unpruned version, demonstrating PIP's ability to preserve key aspects of model effectiveness. Moreover, PIP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) structured pruning methods, establishing it as a leading technique for optimizing LLMs in environments with constrained resources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, leading to widespread adoption in both research and industry. However, their inference workloads are computationally and energy intensive, raising concerns about sustainability and environmental impact. As LLMs continue to scale, it becomes essential to identify and optimize the factors that influence their runtime efficiency without compromising performance. In this work, we systematically investigate the energy-performance trade-offs of LLMs during inference. We benchmark models of varying sizes and architectures, including Falcon-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B, and GPT-Neo-2.7B, across tasks such as question answering, commonsense reasoning, and factual generation. We analyze the effect of input characteristics, such as sequence length, entropy, named entity density and so on. Furthermore, we examine the impact of hardware-level optimizations through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), measuring how different GPU clock settings affect latency and power consumption. Our empirical findings show that model architecture, input complexity, and clock configuration significantly influence inference efficiency. By correlating input features with energy metrics and evaluating DVFS behavior, we identify practical strategies that reduce energy consumption by up to 30% while preserving model quality. This study provides actionable insights for designing energy-efficient and sustainable LLM inference systems.

  Energy communities (ECs) play a key role in enabling local demand shifting and enhancing self-sufficiency, as energy systems transition toward decentralized structures with high shares of renewable generation. To optimally operate them, accurate short-term load forecasting is essential, particularly for implementing demand-side management strategies. With the recent rise of deep learning methods, data-driven forecasting has gained significant attention, however, it remains insufficiently explored in many practical contexts. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art deep learning models -- including LSTM, xLSTM, and Transformer architectures -- compared to traditional benchmarks such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and persistence forecasting, across varying community size, historical data availability, and model complexity. Additionally, we assess the benefits of transfer learning using publicly available synthetic load profiles. On average, transfer learning improves the normalized mean absolute error by 1.97%pt when only two months of training data are available. Interestingly, for less than six months of training data, simple persistence models outperform deep learning architectures in forecast accuracy. The practical value of improved forecasting is demonstrated using a mixed-integer linear programming optimization for ECs with a shared battery energy storage system. The most accurate deep learning model achieves an average reduction in financial energy costs of 8.06%. Notably, a simple KNN approach achieves average savings of 8.01%, making it a competitive and robust alternative. All implementations are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. These findings offer actionable insights for ECs, and they highlight when the additional complexity of deep learning is warranted by performance gains.

  Scientific problems require resolving multi-scale phenomena across different resolutions and learning solution operators in infinite-dimensional function spaces. Neural operators provide a powerful framework for this, using tensor-parameterized layers to capture complex, multi-dimensional relationships. However, scaling neural operators to high-resolution problems leads to significant computational demands, making the training of industrial-scale models prohibitive. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TensorGRaD}, a novel method that directly addresses the memory challenges associated with optimizing large tensor-structured weights. Our approach, based on a \texit{robust tensor decomposition}, factorizes gradients as the sum of a low-rank tensor and a sparse one to efficiently capture information within optimizer states, including outliers. Additionally, we provide a recipe for mixed precision training of TensorGRaD, achieving further memory savings without sacrificing accuracy. We showcase the effectiveness of TensorGRaD on Fourier Neural Operators, a class of models crucial for solving partial differential equations (PDE). We provide theoretical guarantees for TensorGRaD, demonstrating its fundamental advantage over matrix-based gradient compression methods. We empirically demonstrate large improvements across various PDE tasks, including the challenging turbulent Navier-Stokes case at a Reynolds number of $10^5$. TensorGRaD reduces total memory usage by over $50\%$ while maintaining and sometimes even improving accuracy.

  _Kazuki Irie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Do autoregressive Transformer language models require explicit positional encodings (PEs)? The answer is 'no' provided they have more than one layer -- they can distinguish sequences with permuted tokens without the need for explicit PEs. This follows from the fact that a cascade of (permutation invariant) set processors can collectively exhibit sequence-sensitive behavior in the autoregressive setting. This property has been known since early efforts (contemporary with GPT-2) adopting the Transformer for language modeling. However, this result does not appear to have been well disseminated, leading to recent rediscoveries. This may be partially due to a sudden growth of the language modeling community after the advent of GPT-2/3, but perhaps also due to the lack of a clear explanation in prior work, despite being commonly understood by practitioners in the past. Here we review the long-forgotten explanation why explicit PEs are nonessential for multi-layer autoregressive Transformers (in contrast, one-layer models require PEs to discern order information of their inputs), as well as the origin of this result, and hope to re-establish it as a common knowledge.

  Flow matching (FM) models extend ODE sampler based diffusion models into a general framework, significantly reducing sampling steps through learned vector fields. However, the theoretical understanding of FM models, particularly how their sample trajectories interact with underlying data geometry, remains underexplored. A rigorous theoretical analysis of FM ODE is essential for sample quality, stability, and broader applicability. In this paper, we advance the theory of FM models through a comprehensive analysis of sample trajectories. Central to our theory is the discovery that the denoiser, a key component of FM models, guides ODE dynamics through attracting and absorbing behaviors that adapt to the data geometry. We identify and analyze the three stages of ODE evolution: in the initial and intermediate stages, trajectories move toward the mean and local clusters of the data. At the terminal stage, we rigorously establish the convergence of FM ODE under weak assumptions, addressing scenarios where the data lie on a low-dimensional submanifold-cases that previous results could not handle. Our terminal stage analysis offers insights into the memorization phenomenon and establishes equivariance properties of FM ODEs. These findings bridge critical gaps in understanding flow matching models, with practical implications for optimizing sampling strategies and architectures guided by the intrinsic geometry of data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ResGen, an efficient Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)-based generative model for high-fidelity generation with fast sampling. RVQ improves data fidelity by increasing the number of quantization steps, referred to as depth, but deeper quantization typically increases inference steps in generative models. To address this, ResGen directly predicts the vector embedding of collective tokens rather than individual ones, ensuring that inference steps remain independent of RVQ depth. Additionally, we formulate token masking and multi-token prediction within a probabilistic framework using discrete diffusion and variational inference. We validate the efficacy and generalizability of the proposed method on two challenging tasks across different modalities: conditional image generation on ImageNet 256x256 and zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that ResGen outperforms autoregressive counterparts in both tasks, delivering superior performance without compromising sampling speed. Furthermore, as we scale the depth of RVQ, our generative models exhibit enhanced generation fidelity or faster sampling speeds compared to similarly sized baseline models.

  Schrodinger Bridges (SBs) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture. The proposed method generalizes naturally to more general classes of dynamical systems, such as controllable linear time-varying systems, enabling efficient solutions to multi-marginal momentum SB between GMMs, a challenging distribution interpolation problem. We showcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, learning of cellular dynamics using multi-marginal momentum SB problems, and various other examples. We also test our approach on an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) benchmark problem and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cases where the boundary distributions are mixture models while requiring virtually no training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) embed sensitive, human-generated data, prompting the need for unlearning methods. Although certified unlearning offers strong privacy guarantees, its restrictive assumptions make it unsuitable for LLMs, giving rise to various heuristic approaches typically assessed through empirical evaluations. These standard evaluations randomly select data for removal, apply unlearning techniques, and use membership inference attacks (MIAs) to compare unlearned models against models retrained without the removed data. However, to ensure robust privacy protections for every data point, it is essential to account for scenarios in which certain data subsets face elevated risks. Prior research suggests that outliers, particularly including data tied to minority groups, often exhibit higher memorization propensity which indicates they may be more difficult to unlearn. Building on these insights, we introduce a complementary, minority-aware evaluation framework to highlight blind spots in existing frameworks. We substantiate our findings with carefully designed experiments, using canaries with personally identifiable information (PII) to represent these minority subsets and demonstrate that they suffer at least 20% higher privacy leakage across various unlearning methods, MIAs, datasets, and LLM scales. Our proposed minority-aware evaluation framework marks an essential step toward more equitable and comprehensive assessments of LLM unlearning efficacy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) have led to significant reductions in transcription errors on standard benchmarks under the i.i.d. assumption, thus focusing on minimizing in-distribution (ID) errors. However, this assumption does not hold in real-world applications, which has motivated HTR research to explore Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation techniques. In this work, we investigate the unaddressed limitations of HTR models in generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We adopt the challenging setting of Domain Generalization, where models are expected to generalize to OOD data without any prior access. To this end, we analyze 336 OOD cases from eight state-of-the-art HTR models across seven widely used datasets, spanning five languages. Additionally, we study how HTR models leverage synthetic data to generalize. We reveal that the most significant factor for generalization lies in the textual divergence between domains, followed by visual divergence. We demonstrate that the error of HTR models in OOD scenarios can be reliably estimated, with discrepancies falling below 10 points in 70\% of cases. We identify the underlying limitations of HTR models, laying the foundation for future research to address this challenge.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mathematical reasoning presents significant challenges for large language models (LLMs). To enhance their capabilities, we propose Monte Carlo Self-Refine Tree (MC-NEST), an extension of Monte Carlo Tree Search that integrates LLM-based self-refinement and self-evaluation for improved decision-making in complex reasoning tasks. MC-NEST balances exploration and exploitation using Upper Confidence Bound (UCT) scores combined with diverse selection policies. Through iterative critique and refinement, LLMs learn to reason more strategically. Empirical results demonstrate that MC-NEST with an importance sampling policy substantially improves GPT-4o's performance, achieving state-of-the-art pass@1 scores on Olympiad-level benchmarks. Specifically, MC-NEST attains a pass@1 of 38.6 on AIME and 12.6 on MathOdyssey. The solution quality for MC-NEST using GPT-4o and Phi-3-mini reaches 84.0\% and 82.08\%, respectively, indicating robust consistency across different LLMs. MC-NEST performs strongly across Algebra, Geometry, and Number Theory, benefiting from its ability to handle abstraction, logical deduction, and multi-step reasoning -- core skills in mathematical problem solving.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To balance the quality and inference cost of a Foundation Model (FM, such as large language models (LLMs)) powered software, people often opt to train a routing model that routes requests to FMs with different sizes and capabilities. Existing routing models rely on learning the optimal routing decision from carefully curated data, require complex computations to be updated, and do not consider the potential evolution of weaker FMs. In this paper, we propose Real-time Adaptive Routing (RAR), an approach to continuously adapt FM routing decisions while using guided in-context learning to enhance the capabilities of weaker FM. The goal is to reduce reliance on stronger, more expensive FMs. We evaluate our approach on different subsets of the popular MMLU benchmark. Over time, our approach routes 50.2% fewer requests to computationally expensive models while maintaining around 90.5% of the general response quality. In addition, the guides generated from stronger models have shown intra-domain generalization and led to a better quality of responses compared to an equivalent approach with a standalone weaker FM.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically-inspired deep neural networks that efficiently extract temporal information while offering promising gains in terms of energy efficiency and latency when deployed on neuromorphic devices. However, SNN model parameters are sensitive to temporal resolution, leading to significant performance drops when the temporal resolution of target data at the edge is not the same with that of the pre-deployment source data used for training, especially when fine-tuning is not possible at the edge. To address this challenge, we propose three novel domain adaptation methods for adapting neuron parameters to account for the change in time resolution without re-training on target time-resolution. The proposed methods are based on a mapping between neuron dynamics in SNNs and State Space Models (SSMs); and are applicable to general neuron models. We evaluate the proposed methods under spatio-temporal data tasks, namely the audio keyword spotting datasets SHD and MSWC as well as the image classification NMINST dataset. Our methods provide an alternative to - and in majority of the cases significantly outperform - the existing reference method that simply scales the time constant. Moreover, our results show that high accuracy on high temporal resolution data can be obtained by time efficient training on lower temporal resolution data and model adaptation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, but aligning them with human preferences remains a core challenge. As individuals have their own, multi-dimensional preferences, recent studies have explored multi-dimensional personalization, which aims to enable models to generate responses personalized to explicit preferences. However, human preferences are often implicit and thus difficult to articulate, limiting the direct application of this approach. To bridge this gap, we propose Active Multi-dimensional Preference Learning (AMPLe), designed to capture implicit user preferences from interactively collected comparative feedback. Building on Bayesian inference, our work introduces a modified posterior update procedure to mitigate estimation bias and potential noise in comparisons. Also, inspired by generalized binary search, we employ an active query selection strategy to minimize the number of required comparisons by a user. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on language generation tasks, we demonstrate feedback efficiency and effectiveness of our framework in personalizing model responses.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses key limitations of large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge, by incorporating external databases. These databases typically consult multiple sources to encompass up-to-date and various information. However, standard RAG methods often overlook the heterogeneous source reliability in the multi-source database and retrieve documents solely based on relevance, making them prone to propagating misinformation. To address this, we propose Reliability-Aware RAG (RA-RAG) which estimates the reliability of multiple sources and incorporates this information into both retrieval and aggregation processes. Specifically, it iteratively estimates source reliability and true answers for a set of queries with no labelling. Then, it selectively retrieves relevant documents from a few of reliable sources and aggregates them using weighted majority voting, where the selective retrieval ensures scalability while not compromising the performance. We also introduce a benchmark designed to reflect real-world scenarios with heterogeneous source reliability and demonstrate the effectiveness of RA-RAG compared to a set of baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods typically assume that Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on data from a single device or client. However, real-world scenarios often require fine-tuning these models on private data distributed across multiple devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers an appealing solution by preserving user privacy, as sensitive data remains on local devices during training. Nonetheless, integrating PEFT methods into FL introduces two main challenges: communication overhead and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce FedTT and FedTT+, methods for adapting LLMs by integrating tensorized adapters into client-side models' encoder/decoder blocks. FedTT is versatile and can be applied to both cross-silo FL and large-scale cross-device FL. FedTT+, an extension of FedTT tailored for cross-silo FL, enhances robustness against data heterogeneity by adaptively freezing portions of tensor factors, further reducing the number of trainable parameters. Experiments on BERT and LLaMA models demonstrate that our proposed methods successfully address data heterogeneity challenges and perform on par or even better than existing federated PEFT approaches while achieving up to 10$\times$ reduction in communication cost.

  Time series forecasting remains a challenging task, particularly in the context of complex multiscale temporal patterns. This study presents LLM-Mixer, a framework that improves forecasting accuracy through the combination of multiscale time-series decomposition with pre-trained LLMs (Large Language Models). LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons. This work highlights the potential of combining multiscale analysis and LLMs for effective and scalable time-series forecasting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The loss of plasticity in learning agents, analogous to the solidification of neural pathways in biological brains, significantly impedes learning and adaptation in reinforcement learning due to its non-stationary nature. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel approach, {\it Neuroplastic Expansion} (NE), inspired by cortical expansion in cognitive science. NE maintains learnability and adaptability throughout the entire training process by dynamically growing the network from a smaller initial size to its full dimension. Our method is designed with three key components: (\textit{1}) elastic topology generation based on potential gradients, (\textit{2}) dormant neuron pruning to optimize network expressivity, and (\textit{3}) neuron consolidation via experience review to strike a balance in the plasticity-stability dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NE effectively mitigates plasticity loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various tasks in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite environments. NE enables more adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments, which represents a crucial step towards transitioning deep reinforcement learning from static, one-time training paradigms to more flexible, continually adapting models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physics-informed deep learning often faces optimization challenges due to the complexity of solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which involve exploring large solution spaces, require numerous iterations, and can lead to unstable training. These challenges arise particularly from the ill-conditioning of the optimization problem caused by the differential terms in the loss function. To address these issues, we propose learning a solver, i.e., solving PDEs using a physics-informed iterative algorithm trained on data. Our method learns to condition a gradient descent algorithm that automatically adapts to each PDE instance, significantly accelerating and stabilizing the optimization process and enabling faster convergence of physics-aware models. Furthermore, while traditional physics-informed methods solve for a single PDE instance, our approach extends to parametric PDEs. Specifically, we integrate the physical loss gradient with PDE parameters, allowing our method to solve over a distribution of PDE parameters, including coefficients, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through empirical experiments on multiple datasets, comparing both training and test-time optimization performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most federated learning (FL) approaches assume a fixed client set. However, real-world scenarios often involve clients dynamically joining or leaving the system based on their needs or interest in specific tasks. This dynamic setting introduces unique challenges: (1) the optimization objective evolves with the active client set, unlike traditional FL with a static objective; and (2) the current global model may no longer serve as an effective initialization for subsequent rounds, potentially hindering adaptation. To address these challenges, we first provide a convergence analysis under a non-convex loss with a dynamic client set, accounting for factors such as gradient noise, local training iterations, and data heterogeneity. Building on this analysis, we propose a model initialization algorithm that enables rapid adaptation to new client sets whenever clients join or leave the system. Our key idea is to compute a weighted average of previous global models, guided by gradient similarity, to prioritize models trained on data distributions that closely align with the current client set, thereby accelerating recovery from distribution shifts. This plug-and-play algorithm is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing FL methods, offering broad applicability in practice. Experimental results on diverse datasets including both image and text domains, varied label distributions, and multiple FL algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of scenarios.

  Pre-trained generalist policies are rapidly gaining relevance in robot learning due to their promise of fast adaptation to novel, in-domain tasks. This adaptation often relies on collecting new demonstrations for a specific task of interest and applying imitation learning algorithms, such as behavioral cloning. However, as soon as several tasks need to be learned, we must decide which tasks should be demonstrated and how often? We study this multi-task problem and explore an interactive framework in which the agent adaptively selects the tasks to be demonstrated. We propose AMF (Active Multi-task Fine-tuning), an algorithm to maximize multi-task policy performance under a limited demonstration budget by collecting demonstrations yielding the largest information gain on the expert policy. We derive performance guarantees for AMF under regularity assumptions and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness to efficiently fine-tune neural policies in complex and high-dimensional environments.

  LLM inference for enterprise applications, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observe much longer prompt than generations, leading to high prefill cost and response latency. We present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure targeted at reducing the prefill compute (in FLOPs) of prompt tokens while preserving high generation quality. First, SwiftKV prefills later layers' KV cache using an earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip those later layers. Second, SwiftKV employs a lightweight knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs with minimal accuracy impact. Third, SwiftKV can naturally incorporate KV cache compression to improve inference performance in low-memory scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments show that SwiftKV can effectively reduce prefill computation by 25-50% across several LLM families while incurring minimum quality degradation. In the end-to-end inference serving, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B. SwiftKV is open-sourced atthis https URL.

  Frameworks and domain-specific languages for auto-generating code have traditionally depended on human experts to implement rigorous methods ensuring the legality of code transformations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has gained traction for generating code optimized for specific hardware targets. However, ML approaches-particularly black-box neural networks-offer no guarantees on the correctness or legality of the transformations they produce. To address this gap, we introduce Tadashi, an end-to-end system that leverages the polyhedral model to support researchers in curating datasets critical for ML-based code generation. Tadashi provides an end-to-end system capable of applying, verifying, and evaluating candidate transformations on polyhedral schedules with both reliability and practicality. We formally prove that Tadashi guarantees the legality of generated transformations, demonstrate its low runtime overhead, and showcase its broad applicability. Tadashi available atthis https URL.

  Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is challenging because distribution shifts come in many forms. Numerous algorithms exist to address specific settings, but choosing the right training algorithm for the right dataset without trial and error is difficult. Indeed, real-world applications often involve multiple types and combinations of shifts that are hard to analyze theoretically.Method. This work explores the possibility of learning the selection of a training algorithm for OOD generalization. We propose a proof of concept (OOD-Chameleon) that formulates the selection as a multi-label classification over candidate algorithms, trained on a dataset of datasets representing a variety of shifts. We evaluate the ability of OOD-Chameleon to rank algorithms on unseen shifts and datasets based only on dataset characteristics, i.e., without training models first, unlike traditional model selection.Findings. Extensive experiments show that the learned selector identifies high-performing algorithms across synthetic, vision, and language tasks. Further inspection shows that it learns non-trivial decision rules, which provide new insights into the applicability of existing algorithms. Overall, this new approach opens the possibility of better exploiting and understanding the plethora of existing algorithms for OOD generalization.

  Learning conditional distributions $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$ is a central problem in machine learning, which is typically approached via supervised methods with paired data $(x,y) \sim \pi^*$. However, acquiring paired data samples is often challenging, especially in problems such as domain translation. This necessitates the development of $\textit{semi-supervised}$ models that utilize both limited paired data and additional unpaired i.i.d. samples $x \sim \pi^*_x$ and $y \sim \pi^*_y$ from the marginal distributions. The usage of such combined data is complex and often relies on heuristic approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose a new learning paradigm that integrates both paired and unpaired data $\textbf{seamlessly}$ using the data likelihood maximization techniques. We demonstrate that our approach also connects intriguingly with inverse entropic optimal transport (OT). This finding allows us to apply recent advances in computational OT to establish an $\textbf{end-to-end}$ learning algorithm to get $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$. In addition, we derive the universal approximation property, demonstrating that our approach can theoretically recover true conditional distributions with arbitrarily small error. Furthermore, we demonstrate through empirical tests that our method effectively learns conditional distributions using paired and unpaired data simultaneously.

  Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization (MFBO) is a promising framework to speed up materials and molecular discovery as sources of information of different accuracies are at hand at increasing cost. Despite its potential use in chemical tasks, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the many parameters playing a role in MFBO. In this work, we provide guidelines and recommendations to decide when to use MFBO in experimental settings. We investigate MFBO methods applied to molecules and materials problems. First, we test two different families of acquisition functions in two synthetic problems and study the effect of the informativeness and cost of the approximate function. We use our implementation and guidelines to benchmark three real discovery problems and compare them against their single-fidelity counterparts. Our results may help guide future efforts to implement MFBO as a routine tool in the chemical sciences.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Financial organizations collect a huge amount of temporal (sequential) data about clients, which is typically collected from multiple sources (modalities). Despite the urgent practical need, developing deep learning techniques suitable to handle such data is limited by the absence of large open-source multi-source real-world datasets of event sequences. To fill this gap, which is mainly caused by security reasons, we present the first industrial-scale publicly available multimodal banking dataset, MBD, that contains information on more than 2M corporate clients of a large bank. Clients are represented by several data sources: 950M bank transactions, 1B geo position events, 5M embeddings of dialogues with technical support, and monthly aggregated purchases of four bank products. All entries are properly anonymized from real proprietary bank data, and the experiments confirm that our anonymization still saves all significant information for introduced downstream tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel multimodal benchmark suggesting several important practical tasks, such as future purchase prediction and modality matching. The benchmark incorporates our MBD and two public financial datasets. We provide numerical results for the state-of-the-art event sequence modeling techniques including large language models and demonstrate the superiority of fusion baselines over single-modal techniques for each task. Thus, MBD provides a valuable resource for future research in financial applications of multimodal event sequence analysis.HuggingFace Link:this https URLGithub Link:this https URL

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) heavily relies on the careful design of the reward function. However, accurately assigning rewards to each state-action pair in Long-Term Reinforcement Learning (LTRL) tasks remains a significant challenge. As a result, RL agents are often trained under expert guidance. Inspired by the ordinal utility theory in economics, we propose a novel reward estimation algorithm: ELO-Rating based Reinforcement Learning (ERRL). This approach features two key contributions. First, it uses expert preferences over trajectories rather than cardinal rewards (utilities) to compute the ELO rating of each trajectory as its reward. Second, a new reward redistribution algorithm is introduced to alleviate training instability in the absence of a fixed anchor reward. In long-term scenarios (up to 5000 steps), where traditional RL algorithms struggle, our method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how expert preferences influence the results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate the differential privacy (DP) guarantees under the hidden state assumption (HSA) for multi-convex problems. Recent analyses of privacy loss under the hidden state assumption have relied on strong assumptions such as convexity, thereby limiting their applicability to practical problems. In this paper, we introduce the Differential Privacy Mini-Batch Block Coordinate Descent (DP-MBCD) algorithm, accompanied by the privacy loss accounting methods under the hidden state assumption. Our proposed methods apply to a broad range of classical non-convex problems which are or can be converted to multi-convex problems, such as matrix factorization and neural network training. In addition to a tighter bound for privacy loss, our theoretical analysis is also compatible with proximal gradient descent and adaptive calibrated noise scenarios.

  The impressive multimodal capabilities demonstrated by OpenAI's GPT-4 have generated significant interest in the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Visual instruction tuning of MLLMs with machine-generated instruction-following data has shown to enhance zero-shot capabilities across various tasks. However, there has been limited exploration into controlling the quality of the instructionthis http URLmethodologies for data selection in MLLMs often rely on single, unreliable scores or use downstream tasks for selection, which is time-consuming and can lead to potential overfitting on the chosen evaluation datasets. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel data selection methodology that utilizes image-text correlation and model perplexity to evaluate and select data of varying quality. This approach leverages the distinct distribution of these two attributes, mapping data quality into a two-dimensional space that allows for the selection of data based on their location within this distribution. By utilizing this space, we can analyze the impact of task type settings, used as prompts, on data quality. Additionally, this space can be used to construct multi-stage subsets of varying quality to facilitate curriculum learning. Our research includes comprehensive experiments conducted on various datasets. The results emphasize substantial enhancements in five commonly assessed capabilities compared to using the complete dataset. Our codes, data, and models are publicly available at:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The past few years have seen remarkable progress in the decoding of speech from brain activity, primarily driven by large single-subject datasets. However, due to individual variation, such as anatomy, and differences in task design and scanning hardware, leveraging data across subjects and datasets remains challenging. In turn, the field has not benefited from the growing number of open neural data repositories to exploit large-scale deep learning. To address this, we develop neuroscience-informed self-supervised objectives, together with an architecture, for learning from heterogeneous brain recordings. Scaling to nearly 400 hours of MEG data and 900 subjects, our approach shows generalisation across participants, datasets, tasks, and even to novel subjects. It achieves improvements of 15-27% over state-of-the-art models and matches surgical decoding performance with non-invasive data. These advances unlock the potential for scaling speech decoding models beyond the current frontier.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) is a probabilistic framework in which an agent learns a stochastic policy and flow functions to sample objects proportionally to an unnormalized reward function. A number of recent works explored connections between GFlowNets and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) RL, which modifies the standard objective of RL agents by learning an entropy-regularized objective. However, the relationship between GFlowNets and standard RL remains largely unexplored, despite the inherent similarities in their sequential decision-making nature. While GFlowNets can discover diverse solutions through specialized flow-matching objectives, connecting them can simplify their implementation through established RL principles and improve RL's diverse solution discovery capabilities. In this paper, we bridge this gap by revealing a fundamental connection between GFlowNets and one RL's most basic components -- policy evaluation. Surprisingly, we find that the value function obtained from evaluating a uniform policy is closely associated with the flow functions in GFlowNets through the lens of flow iteration under certain structural conditions. Building upon these insights, we introduce a rectified random policy evaluation (RPE) algorithm, which achieves the same reward-matching effect as GFlowNets based on simply evaluating a fixed random policy in these cases, offering a new perspective. Empirical results across extensive benchmarks demonstrate that RPE achieves competitive results compared to previous approaches, shedding light on the previously overlooked connection between (non-MaxEnt) RL and GFlowNets.

  _David Anton, Jendrik-Alexander Tr√∂ger, Henning Wessels, Ulrich R√∂mer, Alexander Henkes, Stefan Hartmann_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The calibration of constitutive models from full-field data has recently gained increasing interest due to improvements in full-field measurement capabilities. In addition to the experimental characterization of novel materials, continuous structural health monitoring is another application that is of great interest. However, monitoring is usually associated with severe time constraints, difficult to meet with standard numerical approaches. Therefore, parametric physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for constitutive model calibration from full-field displacement data are investigated. In an offline stage, a parametric PINN can be trained to learn a parameterized solution of the underlying partial differential equation. In the subsequent online stage, the parametric PINN then acts as a surrogate for the parameters-to-state map in calibration. We test the proposed approach for the deterministic least-squares calibration of a linear elastic as well as a hyperelastic constitutive model from noisy synthetic displacement data. We further carry out Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty. A proper statistical evaluation of the results underlines the high accuracy of the deterministic calibration and that the estimated uncertainty is valid. Finally, we consider experimental data and show that the results are in good agreement with a finite element method-based calibration. Due to the fast evaluation of PINNs, calibration can be performed in near real-time. This advantage is particularly evident in many-query applications such as Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference.

  _Jinho Chang, Jong Chul Ye_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the emergence of diffusion models as a frontline generative model, many researchers have proposed molecule generation techniques with conditional diffusion models. However, the unavoidable discreteness of a molecule makes it difficult for a diffusion model to connect raw data with highly complex conditions like natural language. To address this, here we present a novel latent diffusion model dubbed LDMol for text-conditioned molecule generation. By recognizing that the suitable latent space design is the key to the diffusion model performance, we employ a contrastive learning strategy to extract novel feature space from text data that embeds the unique characteristics of the molecule structure. Experiments show that LDMol outperforms the existing autoregressive baselines on the text-to-molecule generation benchmark, being one of the first diffusion models that outperforms autoregressive models in textual data generation with a better choice of the latent domain. Furthermore, we show that LDMol can be applied to downstream tasks such as molecule-to-text retrieval and text-guided molecule editing, demonstrating its versatility as a diffusion model.

  _Xi Wang, Laurence Aitchison_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The scaling of the optimal AdamW weight decay hyperparameter with model and dataset size is critical as we seek to build larger models, but is poorly understood. We show that weights learned by AdamW can be understood as an exponential moving average (EMA) of recent updates. This gives critical insights for how to set the weight decay in AdamW, and how the weight decay should scale with model and dataset size. In particular, the key hyperparameter for an exponential moving average is the EMA timescale. Intuitively, the EMA timescale can be understood as the number of recent iterations the EMA averages over. We find that the optimal timescale, measured in epochs, is roughly constant as we change model and dataset size. Moreover, given a learning rate, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EMA timescale to the weight decay hyperparameter. Thus, if the optimal EMA timescale is constant, that implies that as the dataset size increases, the optimal weight decay should fall and as the model size increases, the optimal weight decay should increase (if we follow the muP recommendation for scaling the learning rate). We validate these scaling rules on ResNet-18 and Vision Transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and on NanoGPT pre-training on OpenWebText. Finally, we found that as training progresses, muP's learning rate scaling breaks down for AdamW unless weight decay is scaled appropriately.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Convection (thunderstorm) develops rapidly within hours and is highly destructive, posing a significant challenge for nowcasting and resulting in substantial losses to nature and society. After the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, convection nowcasting has experienced rapid advancements, with its performance surpassing that of physics-based numerical weather prediction and other conventional approaches. However, the lead time and coverage of it still leave much to be desired and hardly meet the needs of disaster emergency response. Here, we propose deep diffusion models of satellite (DDMS) to establish an AI-based convection nowcasting system. Specifically, DDMS employs diffusion processes to effectively simulate complicated spatiotemporal evolution patterns of convective clouds, significantly improving the forecast lead time. Additionally, it combines geostationary satellite brightness temperature data and domain knowledge from meteorological experts, thereby achieving planetary-scale forecast coverage. During long-term tests and objective validation based on the FengYun-4A satellite, our system achieves, for the first time, effective convection nowcasting up to 4 hours, with broad coverage (about 20,000,000 km$^2$), remarkable accuracy, and high resolution (15 minutes; 4 km). Its performance reaches a new height in convection nowcasting compared to the existing models. In terms of application, our system is highly transferable with the potential to collaborate with multiple satellites for global convection nowcasting. Furthermore, our results highlight the remarkable capabilities of diffusion models in convective clouds forecasting, as well as the significant value of geostationary satellite data when empowered by AI technologies.

  Data standardization is a crucial part of the data science life cycle. While tools like Pandas offer robust functionalities, their complexity and the manual effort required for customizing code to diverse column types pose significant challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language understanding and code generation, it still demands expert-level programming knowledge and continuous interaction for prompt refinement. To solve these challenges, our key idea is to propose a Python library with declarative, unified APIs for standardizing different column types, simplifying the LLM's code generation with concise API calls. We first proposethis http URL, a component of the Dataprep Python Library, significantly reduces the coding complexity by enabling the standardization of specific column types with a single line of code. Then, we introduce the CleanAgent framework integratingthis http URLand LLM-based agents to automate the data standardization process. With CleanAgent, data scientists only need to provide their requirements once, allowing for a hands-free process. To demonstrate the practical utility of CleanAgent, we developed a user-friendly web application, allowing users to interact with it using real-world datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretraining on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown great power in facilitating various downstream tasks. As pretraining generally requires huge amount of data and computational resources, the pretrained GNNs are high-value Intellectual Properties (IP) of the legitimate owner. However, adversaries may illegally copy and deploy the pretrained GNN models for their downstream tasks. Though initial efforts have been made to watermark GNN classifiers for IP protection, these methods require the target classification task for watermarking, and thus are not applicable to self-supervised pretraining of GNN models. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework named PreGIP to watermark the pretraining of GNN encoder for IP protection while maintain the high-quality of the embedding space. PreGIP incorporates a task-free watermarking loss to watermark the embedding space of pretrained GNN encoder. A finetuning-resistant watermark injection is further deployed. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of {\method} in IP protection and maintaining high-performance for downstream tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized various domains, offering predictive capabilities in several areas. However, with the increasing accessibility of ML tools, many practitioners, lacking deep ML expertise, adopt a "push the button" approach, utilizing user-friendly interfaces without a thorough understanding of underlying algorithms. While this approach provides convenience, it raises concerns about the reliability of outcomes, leading to challenges such as incorrect performance evaluation. This paper addresses a critical issue in ML, known as data leakage, where unintended information contaminates the training data, impacting model performance evaluation. Users, due to a lack of understanding, may inadvertently overlook crucial steps, leading to optimistic performance estimates that may not hold in real-world scenarios. The discrepancy between evaluated and actual performance on new data is a significant concern. In particular, this paper categorizes data leakage in ML, discussing how certain conditions can propagate through the ML workflow. Furthermore, it explores the connection between data leakage and the specific task being addressed, investigates its occurrence in Transfer Learning, and compares standard inductive ML with transductive ML frameworks. The conclusion summarizes key findings, emphasizing the importance of addressing data leakage for robust and reliable ML applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated clustering, an essential extension of centralized clustering for federated scenarios, enables multiple data-holding clients to collaboratively group data while keeping their data locally. In centralized scenarios, clustering driven by representation learning has made significant advancements in handling high-dimensional complex data. However, the combination of federated clustering and representation learning remains underexplored. To bridge this, we first tailor a cluster-contrastive model for learning clustering-friendly representations. Then, we harness this model as the foundation for proposing a new federated clustering method, named cluster-contrastive federated clustering (CCFC). Benefiting from representation learning, the clustering performance of CCFC even double those of the best baseline methods in some cases. Compared to the most related baseline, the benefit results in substantial NMI score improvements of up to 0.4155 on the most conspicuous case. Moreover, CCFC also shows superior performance in handling device failures from a practical viewpoint.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) often represent conflicts between features, arising naturally during training as the network learns to integrate diverse and potentially disagreeing inputs to better predict the target variable. Despite their relevance to the ``reasoning'' processes of these models, the properties and implications of conflicts for understanding and explaining ANNs remain underexplored. In this paper, we develop a rigorous theory of conflicts in ANNs and demonstrate their impact on ANN explainability through two case studies. In the first case study, we use our theory of conflicts to inspire the design of a novel feature attribution method, which we call Conflict-Aware Feature-wise Explanations (CAFE). CAFE separates the positive and negative influences of features and biases, enabling more faithful explanations for models applied to tabular data. In the second case study, we take preliminary steps towards understanding the role of conflicts in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Through our experiments, we identify potentially useful connections between model conflicts and different kinds of distributional shifts in tabular and image data. Overall, our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for conflicts in the development of more reliable explanation methods for AI systems, which are crucial for the beneficial use of these systems in the society.

  The capability of generalization is a cornerstone for the success of modern learning systems. For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes AdvDIFFormer, a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In supervised learning, decision trees are valued for their interpretability and performance. While greedy decision tree algorithms like CART remain widely used due to their computational efficiency, they often produce sub-optimal solutions with respect to a regularized training loss. Conversely, optimal decision tree methods can find better solutions but are computationally intensive and typically limited to shallow trees or binary features. We present Dynamic Programming Decision Trees (DPDT), a framework that bridges the gap between greedy and optimal approaches. DPDT relies on a Markov Decision Process formulation combined with heuristic split generation to construct near-optimal decision trees with significantly reduced computational complexity. Our approach dynamically limits the set of admissible splits at each node while directly optimizing the tree regularized training loss. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DPDT can minimize regularized training losses at least as well as CART. Our empirical study shows on multiple datasets that DPDT achieves near-optimal loss with orders of magnitude fewer operations than existing optimal solvers. More importantly, extensive benchmarking suggests statistically significant improvements of DPDT over both CART and optimal decision trees in terms of generalization to unseen data. We demonstrate DPDT practicality through applications to boosting, where it consistently outperforms baselines. Our framework provides a promising direction for developing efficient, near-optimal decision tree algorithms that scale to practical applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by frequently changing motor symptoms, necessitating continuous symptom monitoring for more targeted treatment. Classical time series classification and deep learning techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in monitoring PD symptoms using wearable accelerometer data due to complex PD movement patterns and the small size of available datasets. We investigate InceptionTime and RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) as they are promising for PD symptom monitoring. InceptionTime's high learning capacity is well-suited to modeling complex movement patterns, while ROCKET is suited to small datasets. With random search methodology, we identify the highest-scoring InceptionTime architecture and compare its performance to ROCKET with a ridge classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on wrist motion data from PD patients. Our findings indicate that all approaches can learn to estimate tremor severity and bradykinesia presence with moderate performance but encounter challenges in detecting dyskinesia. Among the presented approaches, ROCKET demonstrates higher scores in identifying dyskinesia, whereas InceptionTime exhibits slightly better performance in tremor and bradykinesia estimation. Notably, both methods outperform the multi-layer perceptron. In conclusion, InceptionTime can classify complex wrist motion time series and holds potential for continuous symptom monitoring in PD with further development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Entity alignment aims to discover unique equivalent entity pairs with the same meaning across different knowledge graphs (KGs). Existing models have focused on projecting KGs into a latent embedding space so that inherent semantics between entities can be captured for entity alignment. However, the adverse impacts of alignment conflicts have been largely overlooked during training, thereby limiting the entity alignment performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Conflict-aware Pseudo Labeling via Optimal Transport model (CPL-OT) for entity alignment. The key idea is to iteratively pseudo-label alignment pairs empowered with conflict-aware optimal transport (OT) modeling to boost the precision of entity alignment. CPL-OT is composed of two key components -- entity embedding learning with global-local aggregation and iterative conflict-aware pseudo labeling -- that mutually reinforce each other. To mitigate alignment conflicts during pseudo labeling, we propose to use optimal transport as an effective means to warrant one-to-one entity alignment between two KGs with the minimal overall transport cost. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of CPL-OT over state-of-the-art baselines under both settings with and without prior alignment seeds.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) transition from static tools to fully agentic systems, their potential for transforming social science research has become increasingly evident. This paper introduces a structured framework for understanding the diverse applications of LLM-based agents, ranging from simple data processors to complex, multi-agent systems capable of simulating emergent social dynamics. By mapping this developmental continuum across six levels, the paper clarifies the technical and methodological boundaries between different agentic architectures, providing a comprehensive overview of current capabilities and future potential. It highlights how lower-tier systems streamline conventional tasks like text classification and data annotation, while higher-tier systems enable novel forms of inquiry, including the study of group dynamics, norm formation, and large-scale social processes. However, these advancements also introduce significant challenges, including issues of reproducibility, ethical oversight, and the risk of emergent biases. The paper critically examines these concerns, emphasizing the need for robust validation protocols, interdisciplinary collaboration, and standardized evaluation metrics. It argues that while LLM-based agents hold transformative potential for the social sciences, realizing this promise will require careful, context-sensitive deployment and ongoing methodological refinement. The paper concludes with a call for future research that balances technical innovation with ethical responsibility, encouraging the development of agentic systems that not only replicate but also extend the frontiers of social science, offering new insights into the complexities of human behavior.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

  Multi-agent large language models (MA-LLMs) are a rapidly growing research area that leverages multiple interacting language agents to tackle complex tasks, outperforming single-agent large language models. This literature review synthesizes the latest research on agent profiles, communication structures, and decision-making processes, drawing insights from both traditional multi-agent systems and state-of-the-art MA-LLM studies. In doing so, it aims to address the lack of direct comparisons in the field, illustrating how factors like scalability, communication structure, and decision-making processes influence MA-LLM performance. By examining frequent practices and outlining current challenges, the review reveals that multi-agent approaches can yield superior results but also face elevated computational costs and under-explored challenges unique to MA-LLM. Overall, these findings provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for developing robust and efficient multi-agent AI solutions.

  Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive error steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and the need for further research in this area.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-of-the-art methods for Human-AI Teaming and Zero-shot Cooperation focus on task completion, i.e., task rewards, as the sole evaluation metric while being agnostic to how the two agents work with each other. Furthermore, subjective user studies only offer limited insight into the quality of cooperation existing within the team. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the cooperative behaviors arising within the team when trained agents are paired with humans -- a problem that has been overlooked by the existing literature. To formally address this problem, we propose the concept of constructive interdependence -- measuring how much agents rely on each other's actions to achieve the shared goal -- as a key metric for evaluating cooperation in human-agent teams. We interpret interdependence in terms of action interactions in a STRIPS formalism, and define metrics that allow us to assess the degree of reliance between the agents' actions. We pair state-of-the-art agents HAT with learned human models as well as human participants in a user study for the popular Overcooked domain, and evaluate the task reward and teaming performance for these human-agent teams. Our results demonstrate that although trained agents attain high task rewards, they fail to induce cooperative behavior, showing very low levels of interdependence across teams. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that teaming performance is not necessarily correlated with task reward, highlighting that task reward alone cannot reliably measure cooperation arising in a team.

- **[Ensuring Truthfulness in Distributed Aggregative Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08512)**  `arXiv:2501.08512`  
  _Ziqin Chen, Magnus Egerstedt, Yongqiang Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Distributed aggregative optimization methods are gaining increased traction due to their ability to address cooperative control and optimization problems, where the objective function of each agent depends not only on its own decision variable but also on the aggregation of other agents' decision variables. Nevertheless, existing distributed aggregative optimization methods implicitly assume all agents to be truthful in information sharing, which can be unrealistic in real-world scenarios, where agents may act selfishly or strategically. In fact, an opportunistic agent may deceptively share false information in its own favor to minimize its own loss, which, however, will compromise the network-level global performance. To solve this issue, we propose a new distributed aggregative optimization algorithm that can ensure truthfulness of agents and convergence performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that ensures truthfulness in a fully distributed setting, where no "centralized" aggregator exists to collect private information/decision variables from participating agents. We systematically characterize the convergence rate of our algorithm under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex objective functions, which generalizes existing distributed aggregative optimization results that only focus on convex objective functions. We also rigorously quantify the tradeoff between convergence performance and the level of enabled truthfulness under different convexity conditions. Numerical simulations using distributed charging of electric vehicles confirm the efficacy of our algorithm.

- **[Fast-in-Slow: A Dual-System Foundation Model Unifying Fast Manipulation within Slow Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01953)**  `arXiv:2506.01953`  
  _Hao Chen, Jiaming Liu, Chenyang Gu, Zhuoyang Liu, Renrui Zhang, Xiaoqi Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalized policy and execution efficiency constitute the two critical challenges in robotic manipulation. While recent foundation policies benefit from the common-sense reasoning capabilities of internet-scale pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), they often suffer from low execution frequency. To mitigate this dilemma, dual-system approaches, inspired by Kahneman's theory, have been proposed to leverage a VLM-based System 2 model handling high-level reasoning and a separate System 1 action model ensuring real-time control. However, existing designs maintain both systems as separate models, limiting System 1 from fully leveraging the rich pretrained knowledge from the VLM-based System 2. In this work, we propose Fast-in-Slow (FiS), a unified dual-system vision-language-action (VLA) model that embeds the System 1 execution module within the VLM-based System 2 by partially sharing parameters. This innovative paradigm not only enables high-frequency execution in System 1 but also facilitates coordination between the reasoning and execution components within a single foundation model of System 2. Given their fundamentally distinct roles within FiS-VLA, we design the two systems to incorporate heterogeneous modality inputs alongside asynchronous operating frequencies, enabling both fast and precise manipulation. To enable coordination between the two systems, a dual-aware co-training strategy is proposed that equips System 1 with action generation capabilities while preserving System 2's contextual reasoning representation. For evaluation, FiS-VLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 8% in simulation and 11% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, while achieving a 117.7 Hz control frequency with action chunk set to eight.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce DualMap, an online open-vocabulary mapping system that enables robots to understand and navigate dynamically changing environments through natural language queries. Designed for efficient semantic mapping and adaptability to changing environments, DualMap meets the essential requirements for real-world robot navigation applications. Our proposed hybrid segmentation frontend and object-level status check eliminate the costly 3D object merging required by prior methods, enabling efficient online scene mapping. The dual-map representation combines a global abstract map for high-level candidate selection with a local concrete map for precise goal-reaching, effectively managing and updating dynamic changes in the environment. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, efficient scene mapping, and online language-guided navigation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Controlling fine-grained forces during manipulation remains a core challenge in robotics. While robot policies learned from robot-collected data or simulation show promise, they struggle to generalize across the diverse range of real-world interactions. Learning directly from humans offers a scalable solution, enabling demonstrators to perform skills in their natural embodiment and in everyday environments. However, visual demonstrations alone lack the information needed to infer precise contact forces. We present FeelTheForce (FTF): a robot learning system that models human tactile behavior to learn force-sensitive manipulation. Using a tactile glove to measure contact forces and a vision-based model to estimate hand pose, we train a closed-loop policy that continuously predicts the forces needed for manipulation. This policy is re-targeted to a Franka Panda robot with tactile gripper sensors using shared visual and action representations. At execution, a PD controller modulates gripper closure to track predicted forces-enabling precise, force-aware control. Our approach grounds robust low-level force control in scalable human supervision, achieving a 77% success rate across 5 force-sensitive manipulation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enabling robots with contact-rich manipulation remains a pivotal challenge in robot learning, which is substantially hindered by the data collection gap, including its inefficiency and limited sensor setup. While prior work has explored handheld paradigms, their rod-based mechanical structures remain rigid and unintuitive, providing limited tactile feedback and posing challenges for human operators. Motivated by the dexterity and force feedback of human motion, we propose FreeTacMan, a human-centric and robot-free data collection system for accurate and efficient robot manipulation. Concretely, we design a wearable data collection device with dual visuo-tactile grippers, which can be worn by human fingers for intuitive and natural control. A high-precision optical tracking system is introduced to capture end-effector poses, while synchronizing visual and tactile feedback simultaneously. FreeTacMan achieves multiple improvements in data collection performance compared to prior works, and enables effective policy learning for contact-rich manipulation tasks with the help of the visuo-tactile information. We will release the work to facilitate reproducibility and accelerate research in visuo-tactile manipulation.

  _Lukas Rustler, Matej Hoffmann_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present pyCub, an open-source physics-based simulation of the humanoid robot iCub, along with exercises to teach students the basics of humanoid robotics. Compared to existing iCub similators (iCub SIM, iCub Gazebo), which require C++ code and YARP as middleware, pyCub works without YARP and with Python code. The complete robot with all articulations has been simulated, with two cameras in the eyes and the unique sensitive skin of the iCub comprising 4000 receptors on its body surface. The exercises range from basic control of the robot in velocity, joint, and Cartesian space to more complex tasks like gazing, grasping, or reactive control. The whole framework is written and controlled with Python, thus allowing to be used even by people with small or almost no programming practice. The exercises can be scaled to different difficulty levels. We tested the framework in two runs of a course on humanoid robotics. The simulation, exercises, documentation, Docker images, and example videos are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Temporal alignment of multiple signals through time warping is crucial in many fields, such as classification within speech recognition or robot motion learning. Almost all related works are limited to data in Euclidean space. Although an attempt was made in 2011 to adapt this concept to unit quaternions, a general extension to Riemannian manifolds remains absent. Given its importance for numerous applications in robotics and beyond, we introduce Riemannian Time Warping~(RTW). This novel approach efficiently aligns multiple signals by considering the geometric structure of the Riemannian manifold in which the data is embedded. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including tests with an LBR iiwa robot, demonstrate that RTW consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both averaging and classification tasks.

  _Beomjoon Lee, Changjoo Nam_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the bin packing problem (BPP), which aims to maximize bin utilization when packing a variety of items. The offline problem, where the complete information about the item set and their sizes is known in advance, is proven to be NP-hard. The semi-online and online variants are even more challenging, as full information about incoming items is unavailable. While existing methods have tackled both 2D and 3D BPPs, the 2D BPP remains underexplored in terms of fully maximizing utilization. We propose a hierarchical approach for solving the 2D online and semi-online BPP by combining deep reinforcement learning (RL) with heuristic search. The heuristic search selects which item to pack or unpack, determines the packing order, and chooses the orientation of each item, while the RL agent decides the precise position within the bin. Our method is capable of handling diverse scenarios, including repacking, varying levels of item information, differing numbers of accessible items, and coordination of dual manipulators. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves near-optimal utilization across various practical scenarios, largely due to its repacking capability. In addition, the algorithm is evaluated in a physics-based simulation environment, where execution time is measured to assess its real-world performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language-instructed active object localization is a critical challenge for robots, requiring efficient exploration of partially observable environments. However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning effective visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation is challenging, as it requires generating precise actions while maintaining computational efficiency. Existing methods remain unsatisfactory due to inherent limitations in the essential action representation and the basic network architectures. We observe that representing actions in the frequency domain captures the structured nature of motion more effectively: low-frequency components reflect global movement patterns, while high-frequency components encode fine local details. Additionally, robotic manipulation tasks of varying complexity demand different levels of modeling precision across these frequency bands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy learning that progressively models hierarchical frequency components. To further enhance precision, we introduce continuous latent representations that maintain smoothness and continuity in the action space. Extensive experiments across diverse 2D and 3D robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, showcasing the potential of a frequency-domain autoregressive framework with continuous tokens for generalized robotic manipulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective human-robot interaction requires robots to identify human intentions and generate expressive, socially appropriate motions in real-time. Existing approaches often rely on fixed motion libraries or computationally expensive generative models. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines intention-aware reasoning via in-context learning (ICL) with real-time motion generation using diffusion models. Our system introduces structured prompting with confidence scoring, fallback behaviors, and social context awareness to enable intention refinement and adaptive response. Leveraging large-scale motion datasets and efficient latent-space denoising, the framework generates diverse, physically plausible gestures suitable for dynamic humanoid interactions. Experimental validation on a physical platform demonstrates the robustness and social alignment of our method in realistic scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is effective for complex multi-robot tasks, it suffers from low sample efficiency and requires iterative manual reward tuning. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in single-robot settings, but their application in multi-robot systems remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel LLM-Aided MARL (LAMARL) approach, which integrates MARL with LLMs, significantly enhancing sample efficiency without requiring manual design. LAMARL consists of two modules: the first module leverages LLMs to fully automate the generation of prior policy and reward functions. The second module is MARL, which uses the generated functions to guide robot policy training effectively. On a shape assembly benchmark, both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the unique advantages of LAMARL. Ablation studies show that the prior policy improves sample efficiency by an average of 185.9% and enhances task completion, while structured prompts based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and basic APIs improve LLM output success rates by 28.5%-67.5%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Semantic Navigation (VSN) is a fundamental problem in robotics, where an agent must navigate toward a target object in an unknown environment, mainly using visual information. Most state-of-the-art VSN models are trained in simulation environments, where rendered scenes of the real world are used, at best. These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to domain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose SEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main visual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's perception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating high-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies that improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and real world settings. We also introduce a newly curated dataset, i.e. the SEMNAV dataset, designed for training semantic segmentation-aware navigation models like SEMNAV. Our approach is evaluated extensively in both simulated environments and with real-world robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMNAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art VSN models, achieving higher success rates in the Habitat 2.0 simulation environment, using the HM3D dataset. Furthermore, our real-world experiments highlight the effectiveness of semantic segmentation in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, making our model a promising solution for practical VSN-based robotic applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  World model based planning has significantly improved decision-making in complex environments by enabling agents to simulate future states and make informed choices. However, ensuring the prediction accuracy of world models often demands substantial computational resources, posing a major challenge for real-time applications. This computational burden is particularly restrictive in robotics, where resources are severely constrained. To address this limitation, we propose a Sparse Imagination for Efficient Visual World Model Planning, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens processed during forward prediction. Our method leverages a sparsely trained vision-based world model based on transformers with randomized grouped attention strategy, allowing the model to adaptively adjust the number of tokens processed based on the computational resource. By enabling sparse imagination (rollout), our approach significantly accelerates planning while maintaining high control fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that sparse imagination preserves task performance while dramatically improving inference efficiency, paving the way for the deployment of world models in real-time decision-making scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce OG-VLA, a novel architecture and learning framework that combines the generalization strengths of Vision Language Action models (VLAs) with the robustness of 3D-aware policies. We address the challenge of mapping natural language instructions and multi-view RGBD observations to quasi-static robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe policies. OG-VLA projects input observations from diverse views into a point cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model (LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5 demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce HoMeR, an imitation learning framework for mobile manipulation that combines whole-body control with hybrid action modes that handle both long-range and fine-grained motion, enabling effective performance on realistic in-the-wild tasks. At its core is a fast, kinematics-based whole-body controller that maps desired end-effector poses to coordinated motion across the mobile base and arm. Within this reduced end-effector action space, HoMeR learns to switch between absolute pose predictions for long-range movement and relative pose predictions for fine-grained manipulation, offloading low-level coordination to the controller and focusing learning on task-level decisions. We deploy HoMeR on a holonomic mobile manipulator with a 7-DoF arm in a real home. We compare HoMeR to baselines without hybrid actions or whole-body control across 3 simulated and 3 real household tasks such as opening cabinets, sweeping trash, and rearranging pillows. Across tasks, HoMeR achieves an overall success rate of 79.17% using just 20 demonstrations per task, outperforming the next best baseline by 29.17 on average. HoMeR is also compatible with vision-language models and can leverage their internet-scale priors to better generalize to novel object appearances, layouts, and cluttered scenes. In summary, HoMeR moves beyond tabletop settings and demonstrates a scalable path toward sample-efficient, generalizable manipulation in everyday indoor spaces.

  Humanoid robots have the potential to perform complex tasks in human centered environments but require robust predictive models to reason about the outcomes of their actions. We introduce Humanoid World Models (HWM) a family of lightweight open source video based models that forecast future egocentric observations conditioned on actions. We train two types of generative models Masked Transformers and FlowMatching on 100 hours of humanoid demonstrations. Additionally we explore architectural variants with different attention mechanisms and parameter sharing strategies. Our parameter sharing techniques reduce model size by 33 to 53 with minimal impact on performance or visual fidelity. HWM is designed to be trained and deployed in practical academic and small lab settings such as 1 to 2 GPUs.

  This paper extends the fall prediction algorithm from Mungai et al.(2024) to a real-time/online setting, implemented in both hardware and simulation. This yields results comparable to the offline version, maintaining a zero false positive rate, sufficient lead time, and accurate lead time prediction. Additionally, it achieves a high recovery rate. The paper also evaluates the fall prediction algorithm against omnidirectional faults and introduces an improved algorithm capable of reliably predicting falls and lead times across a wider range of faults in full-sized robots. Compared to Mungai et al.(2024), the proposed algorithm performs significantly better across all metrics, such as false positive rate, lead time, accuracy, and response time, demonstrating the algorithm's efficacy for real-time fall prediction in bipedal robots.

  This article presents iRonCub 3, a jet-powered humanoid robot, and its first flight experiments. Unlike traditional aerial vehicles, iRonCub 3 aims to achieve flight using a full-body humanoid form, which poses unique challenges in control, estimation, and system integration. We highlight the robot's current mechanical and software architecture, including its propulsion system, control framework, and experimental infrastructure. The control and estimation framework is first validated in simulation by performing a takeoff and tracking a reference trajectory. Then, we demonstrate, for the first time, a liftoff of a jet-powered humanoid robot - an initial but significant step toward aerial humanoid mobility. Also, we detail how the experimental area around a jet-powered humanoid robot should be designed in order to deal with a level of complexity that is substantially superior than indoor humanoid robot experiments.

  Bipedal robots have advantages in maneuvering human-centered environments, but face greater failure risk compared to other stable mobile plarforms such as wheeled or quadrupedal robots.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been demonstrated effectively in simulations for many multi-robot problems. For autonomous vehicles, the development of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies provide opportunities to further enhance safety of the system. However, zero-shot transfer of simulator-trained MARL policies to hardware dynamic systems remains challenging, and how to leverage communication and shared information for MARL has limited demonstrations on hardware. This problem is challenged by discrepancies between simulated and physical states, system state and model uncertainties, practical shared information design, and the need for safety guarantees in both simulation and hardware. This paper introduces RSR-RSMARL, a novel Robust and Safe MARL framework that supports Real-Sim-Real (RSR) policy adaptation for multi-agent systems with communication among agents, with both simulation and hardware demonstrations. RSR-RSMARL leverages state (includes shared state information among agents) and action representations considering real system complexities for MARL formulation. The MARL policy is trained with robust MARL algorithm to enable zero-shot transfer to hardware considering the sim-to-real gap. A safety shield module using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provides safety guarantee for each individual agent. Experiment results on F1/10th-scale autonomous vehicles with V2V communication demonstrate the ability of RSR-RSMARL framework to enhance driving safety and coordination across multiple configurations. These findings emphasize the importance of jointly designing robust policy representations and modular safety architectures to enable scalable, generalizable RSR transfer in multi-agent autonomy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting-based RGB-D SLAM displays remarkable performance of high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. However, the lack of depth rendering consistency and efficient loop closure limits the quality of its geometric reconstructions and its ability to perform globally consistent mapping online. In this paper, we present 2DGS-SLAM, an RGB-D SLAM system using 2D Gaussian splatting as the map representation. By leveraging the depth-consistent rendering property of the 2D variant, we propose an accurate camera pose optimization method and achieve geometrically accurate 3D reconstruction. In addition, we implement efficient loop detection and camera relocalization by leveraging MASt3R, a 3D foundation model, and achieve efficient map updates by maintaining a local active map. Experiments show that our 2DGS-SLAM approach achieves superior tracking accuracy, higher surface reconstruction quality, and more consistent global map reconstruction compared to existing rendering-based SLAM methods, while maintaining high-fidelity image rendering and improved computational efficiency.

  Designing optimal Bayes filters for nonlinear non-Gaussian systems is a challenging task. The main difficulties are: 1) representing complex beliefs, 2) handling non-Gaussian noise, and 3) marginalizing past states. To address these challenges, we focus on polynomial systems and propose the Max Entropy Moment Kalman Filter (MEM-KF). To address 1), we represent arbitrary beliefs by a Moment-Constrained Max-Entropy Distribution (MED). The MED can asymptotically approximate almost any distribution given an increasing number of moment constraints. To address 2), we model the noise in the process and observation model as MED. To address 3), we propagate the moments through the process model and recover the distribution as MED, thus avoiding symbolic integration, which is generally intractable. All the steps in MEM-KF, including the extraction of a point estimate, can be solved via convex optimization. We showcase the MEM-KF in challenging robotics tasks, such as localization with unknown data association.

  Cooperative perception enables vehicles to share sensor readings and has become a new paradigm to improve driving safety, where the key enabling technology for realizing this vision is to real-time and accurately align and fuse the perceptions. Recent advances to align the views rely on high-density LiDAR data or fine-grained image feature representations, which however fail to meet the requirements of accuracy, real-time, and adaptability for autonomous driving. To this end, we present MMatch, a lightweight system that enables accurate and real-time perception fusion with mmWave radar point clouds. The key insight is that fine-grained spatial information provided by the radar present unique associations with all the vehicles even in two separate views. As a result, by capturing and understanding the unique local and global position of the targets in this association, we can quickly find out all the co-visible vehicles for view alignment. We implement MMatch on both the datasets collected from the CARLA platform and the real-world traffic with over 15,000 radar point cloud pairs. Experimental results show that MMatch achieves decimeter-level accuracy within 59ms, which significantly improves the reliability for autonomous driving.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end autonomous driving systems map sensor data directly to control commands, but remain opaque, lack interpretability, and offer no formal safety guarantees. While recent vision-language-guided reinforcement learning (RL) methods introduce semantic feedback, they often rely on static prompts and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to dynamic driving scenes. We present DriveMind, a unified semantic reward framework that integrates: (i) a contrastive Vision-Language Model (VLM) encoder for stepwise semantic anchoring; (ii) a novelty-triggered VLM encoder-decoder, fine-tuned via chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation, for dynamic prompt generation upon semantic drift; (iii) a hierarchical safety module enforcing kinematic constraints (e.g., speed, lane centering, stability); and (iv) a compact predictive world model to reward alignment with anticipated ideal states. DriveMind achieves 19.4 +/- 2.3 km/h average speed, 0.98 +/- 0.03 route completion, and near-zero collisions in CARLA Town 2, outperforming baselines by over 4% in success rate. Its semantic reward generalizes zero-shot to real dash-cam data with minimal distributional shift, demonstrating robust cross-domain alignment and potential for real-world deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotics has broad applications from automating house chores to taking care of patients. However, evaluating robot control policies is challenging, as real-world testing is expensive, while handcrafted simulations often fail to accurately reflect real-world conditions, resulting in poor correlation between simulated evaluation and real-world outcomes. In this work, we investigate World-model-based Policy Evaluation (WPE). We first train an action-conditioned video generation model as a proxy to real-world environments. To enable efficient rollouts of hundreds of interactive steps while mitigating error accumulation in the world model, we propose an inference scheme which we call Blockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer with adjustable context and decoding horizon lengths. To ensure that the world model indeed follows action input, we propose metrics based on the agreement between the ground truth video and generated video conditioned on the same sequence of actions to evaluate the world model. We then use the world model for policy evaluation by performing Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model while employing a vision-language model (VLM) as a reward function. Interestingly, we found that WPE tends to underestimate the policy values for in-distribution actions and overestimate policy values for out-of-distribution actions. Nevertheless, WPE preserves the relative rankings of different policies. In emulating real robot executions, WPE achieves high fidelity in mimicing robot arm movements as in real videos, while emulating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging. Despite this limitation, we show that a world model can serve as a starting point for evaluating robot policies before real-world deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many core problems in robotics can be framed as constrained optimization problems. Often on these problems, the robotic system has uncertainty, or it would be advantageous to identify multiple high quality feasible solutions. To enable this, we present two novel frameworks for applying principles of constrained optimization to the new variational inference algorithm Stein variational gradient descent. Our general framework supports multiple types of constrained optimizers and can handle arbitrary constraints. We demonstrate on a variety of problems that we are able to learn to approximate distributions without violating constraints. Specifically, we show that we can build distributions of: robot motion plans that exactly avoid collisions, robot arm joint angles on the SE(3) manifold with exact table placement constraints, and object poses from point clouds with table placement constraints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end planning systems for autonomous driving are improving rapidly, especially in closed-loop simulation environments like CARLA. Many such driving systems either do not consider uncertainty as part of the plan itself, or obtain it by using specialized representations that do not generalize. In this paper, we propose EnDfuser, an end-to-end driving system that uses a diffusion model as the trajectory planner. EnDfuser effectively leverages complex perception information like fused camera and LiDAR features, through combining attention pooling and trajectory planning into a single diffusion transformer module. Instead of committing to a single plan, EnDfuser produces a distribution of candidate trajectories (128 for our case) from a single perception frame through ensemble diffusion. By observing the full set of candidate trajectories, EnDfuser provides interpretability for uncertain, multi-modal future trajectory spaces, where there are multiple plausible options. EnDfuser achieves a competitive driving score of 70.1 on the Longest6 benchmark in CARLA with minimal concessions on inference speed. Our findings suggest that ensemble diffusion, used as a drop-in replacement for traditional point-estimate trajectory planning modules, can help improve the safety of driving decisions by modeling the uncertainty of the posterior trajectory distribution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Lightweight long-range mapping is critical for safe navigation of UAV swarms in large-scale unknown environments. Traditional stereo vision systems with fixed short baselines face limited perception ranges. To address this, we propose Flying Co-Stereo, a cross-agent collaborative stereo vision system that leverages the wide-baseline spatial configuration of two UAVs for long-range dense mapping. Key innovations include: (1) a dual-spectrum visual-inertial-ranging estimator for robust baseline estimation; (2) a hybrid feature association strategy combining deep learning-based cross-agent matching and optical-flow-based intra-agent tracking; (3) A sparse-to-dense depth recovery scheme,refining dense monocular depth predictions using exponential fitting of long-range triangulated sparse landmarks for precise metric-scale mapping. Experiments demonstrate the Flying Co-Stereo system achieves dense 3D mapping up to 70 meters with 2.3%-9.7% relative error, outperforming conventional systems by up to 350% in depth range and 450% in coverage area.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods have significantly improved the locomotion performance of legged robots. However, these motion policies face significant challenges when deployed in the real world. Robots operating in uncertain environments struggle to adapt to payload variations and external disturbances, resulting in severe degradation of motion performance. In this work, we propose a novel Hybrid Force-Position Locomotion Policy (HFPLP) learning framework, where the action space of the policy is defined as a combination of target joint positions and feedforward torques, enabling the robot to rapidly respond to payload variations and external disturbances. In addition, the proposed Disturbance-Aware Adaptive Compensation (DAAC) provides compensation actions in the torque space based on external disturbance estimation, enhancing the robot's adaptability to dynamic environmental changes. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world deployment, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods in carrying payloads and resisting disturbances.

  Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making in environments where olfactory cues are essential. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of robotic olfaction, offering a scalable solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world embodied agents face long-horizon tasks, characterized by high-level goals demanding multi-step solutions beyond single actions. Successfully navigating these requires both high-level task planning (i.e., decomposing goals into sub-tasks) and low-level motion control (i.e., generating precise robot actions). While existing vision language action (VLA) models and hierarchical architectures offer potential in embodied tasks, the former often falter in planning, and the latter can suffer from coordination issues, both hampering performance. We introduce a new unified VLA framework for long-horizon tasks, dubbed LoHoVLA, to overcome these limitations. LoHoVLA leverages a large pretrained vision language model (VLM) as the backbone to jointly generate language and action tokens for sub-task generation and robot action prediction, respectively. This shared representation promotes better generalization across tasks. Additionally, LoHoVLA embraces a hierarchical closed-loop control mechanism to mitigate errors originating from both high-level planning and low-level control. To train LoHoVLA, we introduce LoHoSet, a dataset built on the Ravens simulator, containing 20 long-horizon tasks, each with 1,000 expert demonstrations composed of visual observations, linguistic goals, sub-tasks, and robot actions. Experimental results show that LoHoVLA significantly surpasses both hierarchical and standard VLA approaches on long-horizon embodied tasks in the Ravens simulator. These findings underscore the promise of unified architectures for advancing generalizable embodied intelligence.

  _Yizhou Gao, Tim Barfoot_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a new method to combine several rigidly connected but physically separated IMUs through a weighted average into a single virtual IMU (VIMU). This has the benefits of (i) reducing process noise through averaging, and (ii) allowing for tuning the location of the VIMU. The VIMU can be placed to be coincident with, for example, a camera frame or GNSS frame, thereby offering a quality-of-life improvement for users. Specifically, our VIMU removes the need to consider any lever-arm terms in the propagation model. We also present a quadratic programming method for selecting the weights to minimize the noise of the VIMU while still selecting the placement of its reference frame. We tested our method in simulation and validated it on a real dataset. The results show that our averaging technique works for IMUs with large separation and performance gain is observed in both the simulation and the real experiment compared to using only a single IMU.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we explore how conventional motion planning algorithms can be reapplied to contact-rich manipulation tasks. Rather than focusing solely on efficiency, we investigate how manipulation aspects can be recast in terms of conventional motion-planning algorithms. Conventional motion planners, such as Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT), typically compute collision-free paths in configuration space. However, in manipulation tasks, intentional contact is often necessary. For example, when dealing with a crowded bookshelf, a robot must strategically push books aside before inserting a new one. In such scenarios, classical motion planners often fail because of insufficient space. As such, we presents Haptic Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (HapticRRT), a planning algorithm that incorporates a recently proposed optimality measure in the context of \textit{quasi-static} manipulation, based on the (squared) Hessian of manipulation potential. The key contributions are i) adapting classical RRT to a framework that re-frames quasi-static manipulation as a planning problem on an implicit equilibrium manifold; ii) discovering multiple manipulation strategies, corresponding to branches of the equilibrium manifold. iii) providing deeper insight to haptic obstacle and haptic metric, enhancing interpretability. We validate our approach on a simulated pendulum and a real-world crowded bookshelf task, demonstrating its ability to autonomously discover strategic wedging-in policies and multiple branches.

  Robots with multi-modal locomotion are an active research field due to their versatility in diverse environments. In this context, additional actuation can provide humanoid robots with aerial capabilities. Flying humanoid robots face challenges in modeling and control, particularly with aerodynamic forces. This paper addresses these challenges from a technological and scientific standpoint. The technological contribution includes the mechanical design of iRonCub-Mk1, a jet-powered humanoid robot, optimized for jet engine integration, and hardware modifications for wind tunnel experiments on humanoid robots for precise aerodynamic forces and surface pressure measurements. The scientific contribution offers a comprehensive approach to model and control aerodynamic forces using classical and learning techniques. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations calculate aerodynamic forces, validated through wind tunnel experiments on iRonCub-Mk1. An automated CFD framework expands the aerodynamic dataset, enabling the training of a Deep Neural Network and a linear regression model. These models are integrated into a simulator for designing aerodynamic-aware controllers, validated through flight simulations and balancing experiments on the iRonCub-Mk1 physical prototype.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Heuristic search solvers like RTDP-Bel and LAO* have proven effective for computing optimal and bounded sub-optimal solutions for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), which are typically formulated as belief MDPs. A belief represents a probability distribution over possible system states. Given a parent belief and an action, computing belief state transitions involves Bayesian updates that combine the transition and observation models of the POMDP to determine successor beliefs and their transition probabilities. However, there is a class of problems, specifically in robotics, where computing these transitions can be prohibitively expensive due to costly physics simulations, raycasting, or expensive collision checks required by the underlying transition and observation models, leading to long planning times. To address this challenge, we propose Lazy RTDP-Bel and Lazy LAO*, which defer computing expensive belief state transitions by leveraging Q-value estimation, significantly reducing planning time. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed lazy planners in domains such as contact-rich manipulation for pose estimation, outdoor navigation in rough terrain, and indoor navigation with a 1-D LiDAR sensor. Additionally, we discuss practical Q-value estimation techniques for commonly encountered problem classes that our lazy planners can leverage. Our results show that lazy heuristic search methods dramatically improve planning speed by postponing expensive belief transition evaluations while maintaining solution quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot co-design, jointly optimizing morphology and control policy, remains a longstanding challenge in the robotics community, where many promising robots have been developed. However, a key limitation lies in its tendency to converge to sub-optimal designs due to the use of fixed reward functions, which fail to explore the diverse motion modes suitable for different morphologies. Here we propose RoboMoRe, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework that integrates morphology and reward shaping for co-optimization within the robot co-design loop. RoboMoRe performs a dual-stage optimization: in the coarse optimization stage, an LLM-based diversity reflection mechanism generates both diverse and high-quality morphology-reward pairs and efficiently explores their distribution. In the fine optimization stage, top candidates are iteratively refined through alternating LLM-guided reward and morphology gradient updates. RoboMoRe can optimize both efficient robot morphologies and their suited motion behaviors through reward shaping. Results demonstrate that without any task-specific prompting or predefined reward/morphology templates, RoboMoRe significantly outperforms human-engineered designs and competing methods across eight different tasks.

  Effective robotic autonomy in unknown environments demands proactive exploration and precise understanding of both geometry and semantics. In this paper, we propose ActiveSGM, an active semantic mapping framework designed to predict the informativeness of potential observations before execution. Built upon a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) mapping backbone, our approach employs semantic and geometric uncertainty quantification, coupled with a sparse semantic representation, to guide exploration. By enabling robots to strategically select the most beneficial viewpoints, ActiveSGM efficiently enhances mapping completeness, accuracy, and robustness to noisy semantic data, ultimately supporting more adaptive scene exploration. Our experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets highlight the effectiveness of ActiveSGM in active semantic mapping tasks.

  Accurate localization is essential for a wide range of applications, including asset tracking, smart agriculture, and an- imal monitoring. While traditional localization methods, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offer varying levels of accuracy and coverage, they have drawbacks regarding power consumption, infrastruc- ture requirements, and deployment flexibility. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) is emerging as an alternative, offering centimeter-level accuracy and energy efficiency, especially suitable for medium to large field monitoring with capabilities to work indoors and outdoors. However, existing UWB localization systems require infrastructure with mains power to supply the anchors, which impedes their scalability and ease of deployment. This under- scores the need for a fully battery-powered and energy-efficient localization system. This paper presents an energy-optimized, battery-operated UWB localization system that leverages Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) for data transmission to a server backend. By employing single-sided two-way ranging (SS-TWR) in a time- slotted localization approach, the power consumption both on the anchor and the tag is reduced, while maintaining high accuracy. With a low average power consumption of 20.44 mW per anchor and 7.19 mW per tag, the system allows fully battery- powered operation for up to 25 days, achieving average accuracy of 13.96 cm with self-localizing anchors on a 600 m2 testing ground. To validate its effectiveness and ease of installation in a challenging application scenario, ten anchors and two tags were successfully deployed in a tropical zoological biome where they could be used to track Aldabra Giant Tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dexterous manipulation is a crucial yet highly complex challenge in humanoid robotics, demanding precise, adaptable, and sample-efficient learning methods. As humanoid robots are usually designed to operate in human-centric environments and interact with everyday objects, mastering dexterous manipulation is critical for real-world deployment. Traditional approaches, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, have made significant strides, but they often struggle due to the unique challenges of real-world dexterous manipulation, including high-dimensional control, limited training data, and covariate shift. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these challenges and reviews existing learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation, spanning imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and hybrid approaches. A promising yet underexplored direction is interactive imitation learning, where human feedback actively refines a robot's behavior during training. While interactive imitation learning has shown success in various robotic tasks, its application to dexterous manipulation remains limited. To address this gap, we examine current interactive imitation learning techniques applied to other robotic tasks and discuss how these methods can be adapted to enhance dexterous manipulation. By synthesizing state-of-the-art research, this paper highlights key challenges, identifies gaps in current methodologies, and outlines potential directions for leveraging interactive imitation learning to improve dexterous robotic skills.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous operation of service robotics in human-centric scenes remains challenging due to the need for understanding of changing environments and context-aware decision-making. While existing approaches like topological maps offer efficient spatial priors, they fail to model transient object relationships, whereas dense neural representations (e.g., NeRF) incur prohibitive computational costs. Inspired by the hierarchical scene representation and video scene graph generation works, we propose Hi-Dyna Graph, a hierarchical dynamic scene graph architecture that integrates persistent global layouts with localized dynamic semantics for embodied robotic autonomy. Our framework constructs a global topological graph from posed RGB-D inputs, encoding room-scale connectivity and large static objects (e.g., furniture), while environmental and egocentric cameras populate dynamic subgraphs with object position relations and human-object interaction patterns. A hybrid architecture is conducted by anchoring these subgraphs to the global topology using semantic and spatial constraints, enabling seamless updates as the environment evolves. An agent powered by large language models (LLMs) is employed to interpret the unified graph, infer latent task triggers, and generate executable instructions grounded in robotic affordances. We conduct complex experiments to demonstrate Hi-Dyna Grap's superior scene representation effectiveness. Real-world deployments validate the system's practicality with a mobile manipulator: robotics autonomously complete complex tasks with no further training or complex rewarding in a dynamic scene as cafeteria assistant.

  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, in industrial robotics enhances operational efficiency and human-robot collaboration. However, the computational complexity and size of these models often provide latency problems in request and response times.

Experimental results demonstrate that this integration improves execution speed, usability, and accessibility of the human-robot interaction by decreasing the communication latency by 7.01\% on average. Such improvements facilitate smoother, real-time robot operations, which are crucial for industrial automation and precision tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown great promise in advancing robotics by combining embodied reasoning with robot control. A common approach involves training on embodied reasoning tasks related to robot control using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, SFT datasets are often heuristically constructed and not explicitly optimized for improving robot control. Furthermore, SFT often leads to issues such as catastrophic forgetting and reduced generalization performance. To address these limitations, we introduce Robot-R1, a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance embodied reasoning specifically for robot control. Robot-R1 learns to predict the next keypoint state required for task completion, conditioned on the current scene image and environment metadata derived from expert demonstrations. Inspired by the DeepSeek-R1 learning approach, Robot-R1 samples reasoning-based responses and reinforces those that lead to more accurate predictions. Our experiments show that models trained with Robot-R1 outperform SFT methods on embodied reasoning tasks. Despite having only 7B parameters, Robot-R1 even surpasses GPT-4o on reasoning tasks related to low-level action control, such as spatial and primitive movement reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human motion generative modeling or synthesis aims to characterize complicated human motions of daily activities in diverse real-world environments. However, current research predominantly focuses on either low-level, short-period motions or high-level action planning, without taking into account the hierarchical goal-oriented nature of human activities. In this work, we take a step forward from human motion generation to human behavior modeling, which is inspired by cognitive science. We present a unified framework, dubbed Generative Behavior Control (GBC), to model diverse human motions driven by various high-level intentions by aligning motions with hierarchical behavior plans generated by large language models (LLMs). Our insight is that human motions can be jointly controlled by task and motion planning in robotics, but guided by LLMs to achieve improved motion diversity and physical fidelity. Meanwhile, to overcome the limitations of existing benchmarks, i.e., lack of behavioral plans, we propose GBC-100K dataset annotated with a hierarchical granularity of semantic and motion plans driven by target goals. Our experiments demonstrate that GBC can generate more diverse and purposeful high-quality human motions with 10* longer horizons compared with existing methods when trained on GBC-100K, laying a foundation for future research on behavioral modeling of human motions. Our dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

  Multi-sensor fusion is crucial for improving the performance and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing methods predominantly adopt either attention-based flatten fusion or bird's eye view fusion through geometric transformations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited interpretability or dense computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce GaussianFusion, a Gaussian-based multi-sensor fusion framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our method employs intuitive and compact Gaussian representations as intermediate carriers to aggregate information from diverse sensors. Specifically, we initialize a set of 2D Gaussians uniformly across the driving scene, where each Gaussian is parameterized by physical attributes and equipped with explicit and implicit features. These Gaussians are progressively refined by integrating multi-modal features. The explicit features capture rich semantic and spatial information about the traffic scene, while the implicit features provide complementary cues beneficial for trajectory planning. To fully exploit rich spatial and semantic information in Gaussians, we design a cascade planning head that iteratively refines trajectory predictions through interactions with Gaussians. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed GaussianFusion framework. The source code will be released atthis https URL.

  Object-Goal Navigation (OGN) remains challenging in real-world, multi-floor environments and under open-vocabulary object descriptions. We observe that most episodes in widely used benchmarks such as HM3D and MP3D involve multi-floor buildings, with many requiring explicit floor transitions. However, existing methods are often limited to single-floor settings or predefined object categories. To address these limitations, we tackle two key challenges: (1) efficient cross-level planning and (2) zero-shot object-goal navigation (ZS-OGN), where agents must interpret novel object descriptions without prior exposure. We propose ASCENT, a framework that combines a Multi-Floor Spatial Abstraction module for hierarchical semantic mapping and a Coarse-to-Fine Frontier Reasoning module leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware exploration, without requiring additional training on new object semantics or locomotion data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art ZS-OGN approaches on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks while enabling efficient multi-floor navigation. We further validate its practicality through real-world deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving successful object exploration across unseen floors.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven significant progress in robotics, but its complexity and long training times remain major bottlenecks. In this report, we introduce FastTD3, a simple, fast, and capable RL algorithm that significantly speeds up training for humanoid robots in popular suites such as HumanoidBench, IsaacLab, and MuJoCo Playground. Our recipe is remarkably simple: we train an off-policy TD3 agent with several modifications -- parallel simulation, large-batch updates, a distributional critic, and carefully tuned hyperparameters. FastTD3 solves a range of HumanoidBench tasks in under 3 hours on a single A100 GPU, while remaining stable during training. We also provide a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of FastTD3 to accelerate RL research in robotics.

  While end-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, prevailing methods remain fundamentally misaligned with human cognitive principles in both perception and planning. In this paper, we propose CogAD, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving model that emulates the hierarchical cognition mechanisms of human drivers. CogAD implements dual hierarchical mechanisms: global-to-local context processing for human-like perception and intent-conditioned multi-mode trajectory generation for cognitively-inspired planning. The proposed method demonstrates three principal advantages: comprehensive environmental understanding through hierarchical perception, robust planning exploration enabled by multi-level planning, and diverse yet reasonable multi-modal trajectory generation facilitated by dual-level uncertainty modeling. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Bench2Drive demonstrate that CogAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end planning, exhibiting particular superiority in long-tail scenarios and robust generalization to complex real-world driving conditions.

  Humans practice slow thinking before performing actual actions when handling complex tasks in the physical world. This thinking paradigm, recently, has achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.

  We hand the community HAND, a simple and time-efficient method for teaching robots new manipulation tasks through human hand demonstrations. Instead of relying on task-specific robot demonstrations collected via teleoperation, HAND uses easy-to-provide hand demonstrations to retrieve relevant behaviors from task-agnostic robot play data. Using a visual tracking pipeline, HAND extracts the motion of the human hand from the hand demonstration and retrieves robot sub-trajectories in two stages: first filtering by visual similarity, then retrieving trajectories with similar behaviors to the hand. Fine-tuning a policy on the retrieved data enables real-time learning of tasks in under four minutes, without requiring calibrated cameras or detailed hand pose estimation. Experiments also show that HAND outperforms retrieval baselines by over 2x in average task success rates on real robots. Videos can be found at our project website:this https URL.

  Equivariant models have recently been shown to improve the data efficiency of diffusion policy by a significant margin. However, prior work that explored this direction focused primarily on point cloud inputs generated by multiple cameras fixed in the workspace. This type of point cloud input is not compatible with the now-common setting where the primary input modality is an eye-in-hand RGB camera like a GoPro. This paper closes this gap by incorporating into the diffusion policy model a process that projects features from the 2D RGB camera image onto a sphere. This enables us to reason about symmetries in SO(3) without explicitly reconstructing a point cloud. We perform extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Our work is the first SO(3)-equivariant policy learning framework for robotic manipulation that works using only monocular RGB inputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) play a crucial role in maritime operations, yet their navigation in shallow-water environments remains challenging due to dynamic disturbances and depth constraints. Traditional navigation strategies struggle with limited sensor information, making safe and efficient operation difficult. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for ASV navigation under depth constraints, where the vehicle must reach a target while avoiding unsafe areas with only a single depth measurement per timestep from a downward-facing Single Beam Echosounder (SBES). To enhance environmental awareness, we integrate Gaussian Process (GP) regression into the RL framework, enabling the agent to progressively estimate a bathymetric depth map from sparse sonar readings. This approach improves decision-making by providing a richer representation of the environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate effective sim-to-real transfer, ensuring that trained policies generalize well to real-world aquatic conditions. Experimental results validate our method's capability to improve ASV navigation performance while maintaining safety in challenging shallow-water environments.

  Building a lifelong robot that can effectively leverage prior knowledge for continuous skill acquisition remains significantly challenging. Despite the success of experience replay and parameter-efficient methods in alleviating catastrophic forgetting problem, naively applying these methods causes a failure to leverage the shared primitives between skills. To tackle these issues, we propose Primitive Prompt Learning (PPL), to achieve lifelong robot manipulation via reusable and extensible primitives. Within our two stage learning scheme, we first learn a set of primitive prompts to represent shared primitives through multi-skills pre-training stage, where motion-aware prompts are learned to capture semantic and motion shared primitives across different skills. Secondly, when acquiring new skills in lifelong span, new prompts are appended and optimized with frozen pretrained prompts, boosting the learning via knowledge transfer from old skills to new ones. For evaluation, we construct a large-scale skill dataset and conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating PPL's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

  Vision-language-action models (VLAs) show potential as generalist robot policies. However, these models pose extreme safety challenges during real-world deployment, including the risk of harm to the environment, the robot itself, and humans. How can safety constraints be explicitly integrated into VLAs? We address this by exploring an integrated safety approach (ISA), systematically modeling safety requirements, then actively eliciting diverse unsafe behaviors, effectively constraining VLA policies via safe reinforcement learning, and rigorously assuring their safety through targeted evaluations. Leveraging the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) paradigm, ISA optimizes VLAs from a min-max perspective against elicited safety risks. Thus, policies aligned through this comprehensive approach achieve the following key features: (I) effective safety-performance trade-offs, this exploration yields an 83.58% safety improvement compared to the current state-of-the-art method, while also maintaining task performance (+3.85%). (II) strong safety assurance, with the ability to mitigate long-tail risks and handle extreme failure scenarios. (III) robust generalization of learned safety behaviors to various out-of-distribution perturbations. Our data, models and newly proposed benchmark environment are available atthis https URL.

  Diffusion policies are widely adopted in complex visuomotor tasks for their ability to capture multimodal action distributions. However, the multiple sampling steps required for action generation significantly harm real-time inference efficiency, which limits their applicability in real-time decision-making scenarios. Existing acceleration techniques either require retraining or degrade performance under low sampling steps. Here we propose Falcon, which mitigates this speed-performance trade-off and achieves further acceleration. The core insight is that visuomotor tasks exhibit sequential dependencies between actions. Falcon leverages this by reusing partially denoised actions from historical information rather than sampling from Gaussian noise at each step. By integrating current observations, Falcon reduces sampling steps while preserving performance. Importantly, Falcon is a training-free algorithm that can be applied as a plug-in to further improve decision efficiency on top of existing acceleration techniques. We validated Falcon in 48 simulated environments and 2 real-world robot experiments. demonstrating a 2-7x speedup with negligible performance degradation, offering a promising direction for efficient visuomotor policy design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The performance of legged locomotion is closely tied to the accuracy and comprehensiveness of state observations. Blind policies, which rely solely on proprioception, are considered highly robust due to the reliability of proprioceptive observations. However, these policies significantly limit locomotion speed and often require collisions with the terrain to adapt. In contrast, Vision policies allows the robot to plan motions in advance and respond proactively to unstructured terrains with an online perception module. However, perception is often compromised by noisy real-world environments, potential sensor failures, and the limitations of current simulations in presenting dynamic or deformable terrains. Humanoid robots, with high degrees of freedom and inherently unstable morphology, are particularly susceptible to misguidance from deficient perception, which can result in falls or termination on challenging dynamic terrains. To leverage the advantages of both vision and blind policies, we propose VB-Com, a composite framework that enables humanoid robots to determine when to rely on the vision policy and when to switch to the blind policy under perceptual deficiency. We demonstrate that VB-Com effectively enables humanoid robots to traverse challenging terrains and obstacles despite perception deficiencies caused by dynamic terrains or perceptual noise.

  Robotic systems are increasingly employed for industrial automation, with contact-rich tasks like polishing requiring dexterity and compliant behaviour. These tasks are difficult to model, making classical control challenging. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution by enabling the learning of models and control policies directly from data. However, its application to real-world problems is limited by data inefficiency and unsafe exploration. Adaptive hybrid RL methods blend classical control and RL adaptively, combining the strengths of both: structure from control and learning from RL. This has led to improvements in data efficiency and exploration safety. However, their potential for hardware applications remains underexplored, with no evaluations on physical systems to date. Such evaluations are critical to fully assess the practicality and effectiveness of these methods in real-world settings. This work presents an experimental demonstration of the hybrid RL algorithm CHEQ for robotic polishing with variable impedance, a task requiring precise force and velocity tracking. In simulation, we show that variable impedance enhances polishing performance. We compare standalone RL with adaptive hybrid RL, demonstrating that CHEQ achieves effective learning while adhering to safety constraints. On hardware, CHEQ achieves effective polishing behaviour, requiring only eight hours of training and incurring just five failures. These results highlight the potential of adaptive hybrid RL for real-world, contact-rich tasks trained directly on hardware.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is a crucial component of LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms. However, its performance can be negatively affected in unstructured environments that lack features and geometric structures, leading to low accuracy and poor robustness in localization and mapping. It is known that degeneracy caused by the lack of geometric constraints can lead to errors in 6-DOF pose estimation along ill-conditioned directions. Therefore, there is a need for a broader and more fine-grained degeneracy detection and handling method. This paper proposes a new point cloud registration framework, LP-ICP, that combines point-to-line and point-to-plane distance metrics in the ICP algorithm, with localizability detection and handling. Rather than relying solely on point-to-plane localizability information, LP-ICP enhances the localizability analysis by incorporating a point-to-line metric, thereby exploiting richer geometric constraints. It consists of a localizability detection module and an optimization module. The localizability detection module performs localizability analysis by utilizing the correspondences between edge points (with low local smoothness) to lines and planar points (with high local smoothness) to planes between the scan and the map. The localizability contribution of individual correspondence constraints can be applied to a broader range. The optimization module adds additional soft and hard constraints to the optimization equations based on the localizability category. This allows the pose to be constrained along ill-conditioned directions. The proposed method is evaluated on simulation and real-world datasets, showing comparable or better accuracy than the state-of-the art methods in tested scenarios. Observed variations in partially localizable directions suggest the need for further investigation on robustness and generalizability.

  Unthinking execution of human instructions in robotic manipulation can lead to severe safety risks, such as poisonings, fires, and even explosions. In this paper, we present responsible robotic manipulation, which requires robots to consider potential hazards in the real-world environment while completing instructions and performing complex operations safely and efficiently. However, such scenarios in real world are variable and risky for training. To address this challenge, we propose Safety-as-policy, which includes (i) a world model to automatically generate scenarios containing safety risks and conduct virtual interactions, and (ii) a mental model to infer consequences with reflections and gradually develop the cognition of safety, allowing robots to accomplish tasks while avoiding dangers. Additionally, we create the SafeBox synthetic dataset, which includes one hundred responsible robotic manipulation tasks with different safety risk scenarios and instructions, effectively reducing the risks associated with real-world experiments. Experiments demonstrate that Safety-as-policy can avoid risks and efficiently complete tasks in both synthetic dataset and real-world experiments, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Our SafeBox dataset shows consistent evaluation results with real-world scenarios, serving as a safe and effective benchmark for future research.

  Large-scale visuomotor policy learning is a promising approach toward developing generalizable manipulation systems. Yet, policies that can be deployed on diverse embodiments, environments, and observational modalities remain elusive. In this work, we investigate how knowledge from large-scale visual data of the world may be used to address one axis of variation for generalizable manipulation: observational viewpoint. Specifically, we study single-image novel view synthesis models, which learn 3D-aware scene-level priors by rendering images of the same scene from alternate camera viewpoints given a single input image. For practical application to diverse robotic data, these models must operate zero-shot, performing view synthesis on unseen tasks and environments. We empirically analyze view synthesis models within a simple data-augmentation scheme that we call View Synthesis Augmentation (VISTA) to understand their capabilities for learning viewpoint-invariant policies from single-viewpoint demonstration data. Upon evaluating the robustness of policies trained with our method to out-of-distribution camera viewpoints, we find that they outperform baselines in both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks.

  This study presents a set of algorithms that deal with trajectory planning of rational single-loop mechanisms with one degree of freedom (DoF). Benefiting from a dual quaternion representation of a rational motion, a formula for direct (forward) kinematics, a numerical inverse kinematics algorithm, and the generation of a driving-joint trajectory are provided. A novel approach using the Gauss-Newton search for the one-parameter inverse kinematics problem is presented. Additionally, a method for performing smooth equidistant travel of the tool is provided by applying arc-length reparameterization. This general approach can be applied to one-DoF mechanisms with four to seven joints characterized by a rational motion, without any additional geometrical analysis.

  This paper presents a novel approach to fall prediction for bipedal robots, specifically targeting the detection of potential falls while standing caused by abrupt, incipient, and intermittent faults. Leveraging a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), our method aims to maximize lead time for fall prediction while minimizing false positive rates. The proposed algorithm uniquely integrates the detection of various fault types and estimates the lead time for potential falls. Our contributions include the development of an algorithm capable of detecting abrupt, incipient, and intermittent faults in full-sized robots, its implementation using both simulation and hardware data for a humanoid robot, and a method for estimating lead time. Evaluation metrics, including false positive rate, lead time, and response time, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Particularly, our model achieves impressive lead times and response times across different fault scenarios with a false positive rate of 0. The findings of this study hold significant implications for enhancing the safety and reliability of bipedal robotic systems.

  The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly increasing in applications ranging from surveillance and first-aid missions to industrial automation involving cooperation with other machines or humans. To maximize area coverage and reduce mission latency, swarms of collaborating drones have become a significant research direction. However, this approach requires open challenges in positioning, mapping, and communications to be addressed. This work describes a distributed mapping system based on a swarm of nano-UAVs, characterized by a limited payload of 35 g and tightly constrained onboard sensing and computing capabilities. Each nano-UAV is equipped with four 64-pixel depth sensors that measure the relative distance to obstacles in four directions. The proposed system merges the information from the swarm and generates a coherent grid map without relying on any external infrastructure. The data fusion is performed using the iterative closest point algorithm and a graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm, running entirely onboard the UAV's low-power ARM Cortex-M microcontroller with just 192 kB of memory. Field results gathered in three different mazes with a swarm of up to 4 nano-UAVs prove a mapping accuracy of 12 cm and demonstrate that the mapping time is inversely proportional to the number of agents. The proposed framework scales linearly in terms of communication bandwidth and onboard computational complexity, supporting communication between up to 20 nano-UAVs and mapping of areas up to 180 m2 with the chosen configuration requiring only 50 kB of memory.
