- **[TxGemma: Efficient and Agentic LLMs for Therapeutics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06196)**  `arXiv:2504.06196`  
  _Eric Wang, Samuel Schmidgall, Paul F. Jaeger, Fan Zhang, Rory Pilgrim, Yossi Matias, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Therapeutic development is a costly and high-risk endeavor that is often plagued by high failure rates. To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources, enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases, and cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on 64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50 (superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks, such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited applications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized property predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language, provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and engage in scientific discussions. Building on this, we further introduce Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain knowledge. Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark (Chemistry & Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over o3-mini (high).

- **[SkillFlow: Efficient Skill and Code Transfer Through Communication in Adapting AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06188)**  `arXiv:2504.06188`  
  _Pagkratios Tagkopoulos, Fangzhou Li, Ilias Tagkopoulos_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI agents are autonomous systems that can execute specific tasks based on predefined programming. Here, we present SkillFlow, a modular, technology-agnostic framework that allows agents to expand their functionality in an ad-hoc fashion by acquiring new skills from their environment or other agents. We present a theoretical model that examines under which conditions this framework would be beneficial, and we then explore SkillFlow's ability to accelerate task completion and lead to lower cumulative costs in a real-world application, namely scheduling agents for calendar events. We demonstrate that within a few iterations, SkillFlow leads to considerable (24.8%, p-value = $6.4\times10^{-3}$) gains in time and cost, especially when the communication cost is high. Finally, we draw analogies from well-studied biological systems and compare this framework to that of lateral gene transfer, a significant process of adaptation and evolution in novel environments.

- **[Decentralizing AI Memory: SHIMI, a Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index for Scalable Agent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06135)**  `arXiv:2504.06135`  
  _Tooraj Helmi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector-based search have become foundational tools for memory in AI systems, yet they struggle with abstraction, scalability, and semantic precision - especially in decentralized environments. We present SHIMI (Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index), a unified architecture that models knowledge as a dynamically structured hierarchy of concepts, enabling agents to retrieve information based on meaning rather than surface similarity. SHIMI organizes memory into layered semantic nodes and supports top-down traversal from abstract intent to specific entities, offering more precise and explainable retrieval. Critically, SHIMI is natively designed for decentralized ecosystems, where agents maintain local memory trees and synchronize them asynchronously across networks. We introduce a lightweight sync protocol that leverages Merkle-DAG summaries, Bloom filters, and CRDT-style conflict resolution to enable partial synchronization with minimal overhead. Through benchmark experiments and use cases involving decentralized agent collaboration, we demonstrate SHIMI's advantages in retrieval accuracy, semantic fidelity, and scalability - positioning it as a core infrastructure layer for decentralized cognitive systems.

- **[Leanabell-Prover: Posttraining Scaling in Formal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06122)**  `arXiv:2504.06122`  
  _Jingyuan Zhang, Qi Wang, Xingguang Ji, Yahui Liu, Yang Yue, Fuzheng Zhang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in automated theorem proving (ATP) through LLMs have highlighted the potential of formal reasoning with Lean 4 codes. However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in naturalthis http URLbegin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.

- **[Information-Theoretic Reward Decomposition for Generalizable RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06020)**  `arXiv:2504.06020`  
  _Liyuan Mao, Haoran Xu, Amy Zhang, Weinan Zhang, Chenjia Bai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.

- **[Representing Normative Regulations in OWL DL for Automated Compliance Checking Supported by Text Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05951)**  `arXiv:2504.05951`  
  _Ildar Baimuratov, Denis Turygin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compliance checking is the process of determining whether a regulated entity adheres to these regulations. Currently, compliance checking is predominantly manual, requiring significant time and highly skilled experts, while still being prone to errors caused by the human factor. Various approaches have been explored to automate compliance checking, however, representing regulations in OWL DL language which enables compliance checking through OWL reasoning has not been adopted. In this work, we propose an annotation schema and an algorithm that transforms text annotations into machine-interpretable OWL DL code. The proposed approach is validated through a proof-of-concept implementation applied to examples from the building construction domain.

- **[AEGIS: Human Attention-based Explainable Guidance for Intelligent Vehicle Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05950)**  `arXiv:2504.05950`  
  _Zhuoli Zhuang, Cheng-You Lu, Yu-Cheng Fred Chang, Yu-Kai Wang, Thomas Do, Chin-Teng Lin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Improving decision-making capabilities in Autonomous Intelligent Vehicles (AIVs) has been a heated topic in recent years. Despite advancements, training machines to capture regions of interest for comprehensive scene understanding, like human perception and reasoning, remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel framework, Human Attention-based Explainable Guidance for Intelligent Vehicle Systems (AEGIS). AEGIS utilizes human attention, converted from eye-tracking, to guide reinforcement learning (RL) models to identify critical regions of interest for decision-making. AEGIS uses a pre-trained human attention model to guide RL models to identify critical regions of interest for decision-making. By collecting 1.2 million frames from 20 participants across six scenarios, AEGIS pre-trains a model to predict human attention patterns.

- **[Systematic Parameter Decision in Approximate Model Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05874)**  `arXiv:2504.05874`  
  _Jinping Lei, Toru Takisaka, Junqiang Peng, Mingyu Xiao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a novel approach to determining the internal parameters of the hashing-based approximate model counting algorithm $\mathsf{ApproxMC}$. In this problem, the chosen parameter values must ensure that $\mathsf{ApproxMC}$ is Probably Approximately Correct (PAC), while also making it as efficient as possible. The existing approach to this problem relies on heuristics; in this paper, we solve this problem by formulating it as an optimization problem that arises from generalizing $\mathsf{ApproxMC}$'s correctness proof to arbitrary parameter values.Our approach separates the concerns of algorithm soundness and optimality, allowing us to address the former without the need for repetitive case-by-case argumentation, while establishing a clear framework for the latter. Furthermore, after reduction, the resulting optimization problem takes on an exceptionally simple form, enabling the use of a basic search algorithm and providing insight into how parameter values affect algorithm performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our optimized parameters improve the runtime performance of the latest $\mathsf{ApproxMC}$ by a factor of 1.6 to 2.4, depending on the error tolerance.

- **[Agent Guide: A Simple Agent Behavioral Watermarking Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05871)**  `arXiv:2504.05871`  
  _Kaibo Huang, Zhongliang Yang, Linna Zhou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing deployment of intelligent agents in digital ecosystems, such as social media platforms, has raised significant concerns about traceability and accountability, particularly in cybersecurity and digital content protection. Traditional large language model (LLM) watermarking techniques, which rely on token-level manipulations, are ill-suited for agents due to the challenges of behavior tokenization and information loss during behavior-to-action translation. To address these issues, we propose Agent Guide, a novel behavioral watermarking framework that embeds watermarks by guiding the agent's high-level decisions (behavior) through probability biases, while preserving the naturalness of specific executions (action). Our approach decouples agent behavior into two levels, behavior (e.g., choosing to bookmark) and action (e.g., bookmarking with specific tags), and applies watermark-guided biases to the behavior probability distribution. We employ a z-statistic-based statistical analysis to detect the watermark, ensuring reliable extraction over multiple rounds. Experiments in a social media scenario with diverse agent profiles demonstrate that Agent Guide achieves effective watermark detection with a low false positive rate. Our framework provides a practical and robust solution for agent watermarking, with applications in identifying malicious agents and protecting proprietary agent systems.

  _Seungyoon Woo, Junhyeog Yun, Gunhee Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Fields (NF) have gained prominence as a versatile framework for complex data representation. This work unveils a new problem setting termed \emph{Meta-Continual Learning of Neural Fields} (MCL-NF) and introduces a novel strategy that employs a modular architecture combined with optimization-based meta-learning. Focused on overcoming the limitations of existing methods for continual learning of neural fields, such as catastrophic forgetting and slow convergence, our strategy achieves high-quality reconstruction with significantly improved learning speed. We further introduce Fisher Information Maximization loss for neural radiance fields (FIM-NeRF), which maximizes information gains at the sample level to enhance learning generalization, with proved convergence guarantee and generalization bound. We perform extensive evaluations across image, audio, video reconstruction, and view synthesis tasks on six diverse datasets, demonstrating our method's superiority in reconstruction quality and speed over existing MCL and CL-NF approaches. Notably, our approach attains rapid adaptation of neural fields for city-scale NeRF rendering with reduced parameter requirement.

- **[From Superficial to Deep: Integrating External Knowledge for Follow-up Question Generation Using Knowledge Graph and LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05801)**  `arXiv:2504.05801`  
  _Jianyu Liu, Yi Huang, Sheng Bi, Junlan Feng, Guilin Qi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In a conversational system, dynamically generating follow-up questions based on context can help users explore information and provide a better user experience. Humans are usually able to ask questions that involve some general life knowledge and demonstrate higher order cognitive skills. However, the questions generated by existing methods are often limited to shallow contextual questions that are uninspiring and have a large gap to the human level. In this paper, we propose a three-stage external knowledge-enhanced follow-up question generation method, which generates questions by identifying contextual topics, constructing a knowledge graph (KG) online, and finally combining these with a large language model to generate the final question. The model generates information-rich and exploratory follow-up questions by introducing external common sense knowledge and performing a knowledge fusion operation. Experiments show that compared to baseline models, our method generates questions that are more informative and closer to human questioning levels while maintaining contextual relevance.

  _Tianqi Ding, Dawei Xiang, Tianyao Sun, YiJiashum Qi, Zunduo Zhao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a comprehensive review of AI-driven prognostics for State of Health (SoH) prediction in lithium-ion batteries. We compare the effectiveness of various AI algorithms, including FFNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM, across multiple datasets (CALCE, NASA, UDDS) and scenarios (e.g., varying temperatures and driving conditions). Additionally, we analyze the factors influencing SoH fluctuations, such as temperature and charge-discharge rates, and validate our findings through simulations. The results demonstrate that BiLSTM achieves the highest accuracy, with an average RMSE reduction of 15% compared to LSTM, highlighting its robustness in real-world applications.

  _Sudeshna Jana, Manjira Sinha, Tirthankar Dasgupta_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate prediction of Length of Stay (LOS) in hospitals is crucial for improving healthcare services, resource management, and cost efficiency. This paper presents StayLTC, a multimodal deep learning framework developed to forecast real-time hospital LOS using Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs). LTCs, with their continuous-time recurrent dynamics, are evaluated against traditional models using structured data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and clinical notes. Our evaluation, conducted on the MIMIC-III dataset, demonstrated that LTCs significantly outperform most of the other time series models, offering enhanced accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in resource utilization. Additionally, LTCs demonstrate a comparable performance in LOS prediction compared to time series large language models, while requiring significantly less computational power and memory, underscoring their potential to advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in healthcare.

- **[Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05621)**  `arXiv:2504.05621`  
  _Bing Han, Feifei Zhao, Yinqian Sun, Wenxuan Pan, Yi Zeng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cognitive functions in current artificial intelligence networks are tied to the exponential increase in network scale, whereas the human brain can continuously learn hundreds of cognitive functions with remarkably low energy consumption. This advantage is in part due to the brain cross-regional temporal development mechanisms, where the progressive formation, reorganization, and pruning of connections from basic to advanced regions, facilitate knowledge transfer and prevent network redundancy. Inspired by these, we propose the Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism(TD-MCL), enabling cognitive enhancement from simple to complex in Perception-Motor-Interaction(PMI) multiple cognitive task scenarios. The TD-MCL model proposes the sequential evolution of long-range connections between different cognitive modules to promote positive knowledge transfer, while using feedback-guided local connection inhibition and pruning to effectively eliminate redundancies in previous tasks, reducing energy consumption while preserving acquired knowledge. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve continual learning capabilities while reducing network scale, without introducing regularization, replay, or freezing strategies, and achieving superior accuracy on new tasks compared to direct learning. The proposed method shows that the brain's developmental mechanisms offer a valuable reference for exploring biologically plausible, low-energy enhancements of general cognitive abilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing availability of large-scale datasets has fueled rapid progress across many scientific fields, creating unprecedented opportunities for research and discovery while posing significant analytical challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents have opened new possibilities for human-AI collaboration, offering powerful tools to navigate this complex research landscape. In this paper, we introduce SciSciGPT, an open-source, prototype AI collaborator that uses the science of science as a testbed to explore the potential of LLM-powered research tools. SciSciGPT automates complex workflows, supports diverse analytical approaches, accelerates research prototyping and iteration, and facilitates reproducibility. Through case studies, we demonstrate its ability to streamline a wide range of empirical and analytical research tasks while highlighting its broader potential to advance research. We further propose an LLM Agent capability maturity model for human-AI collaboration, envisioning a roadmap to further improve and expand upon frameworks like SciSciGPT. As AI capabilities continue to evolve, frameworks like SciSciGPT may play increasingly pivotal roles in scientific research and discovery, unlocking further opportunities. At the same time, these new advances also raise critical challenges, from ensuring transparency and ethical use to balancing human and AI contributions. Addressing these issues may shape the future of scientific inquiry and inform how we train the next generation of scientists to thrive in an increasingly AI-integrated research ecosystem.

- **[Reasoning Models Know When They're Right: Probing Hidden States for Self-Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05419)**  `arXiv:2504.05419`  
  _Anqi Zhang, Yulin Chen, Jane Pan, Chen Zhao, Aurojit Panda, Jinyang Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance on tasks like math and logical reasoning thanks to their ability to search during reasoning. However, they still suffer from overthinking, often performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after reaching the correct answer. This raises the question: can models evaluate the correctness of their intermediate answers during reasoning? In this work, we study whether reasoning models encode information about answer correctness through probing the model's hidden states. The resulting probe can verify intermediate answers with high accuracy and produces highly calibrated scores. Additionally, we find models' hidden states encode correctness of future answers, enabling early prediction of the correctness before the intermediate answer is fully formulated. We then use the probe as a verifier to decide whether to exit reasoning at intermediate answers during inference, reducing the number of inference tokens by 24\% without compromising performance. These findings confirm that reasoning models do encode a notion of correctness yet fail to exploit it, revealing substantial untapped potential to enhance their efficiency.

  _Yotam Amitai, Ofra Amir, Guy Avni_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As reinforcement learning methods increasingly amass accomplishments, the need for comprehending their solutions becomes more crucial. Most explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) methods generate a static explanation depicting their developers' intuition of what should be explained and how. In contrast, literature from the social sciences proposes that meaningful explanations are structured as a dialog between the explainer and the explainee, suggesting a more active role for the user and her communication with the agent. In this paper, we present ASQ-IT -- an interactive explanation system that presents video clips of the agent acting in its environment based on queries given by the user that describe temporal properties of behaviors of interest. Our approach is based on formal methods: queries in ASQ-IT's user interface map to a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf), which we developed, and our algorithm for query processing is based on automata theory. User studies show that end-users can understand and formulate queries in ASQ-IT and that using ASQ-IT assists users in identifying faulty agent behaviors.

  _Xueqiao Zhang, Chao Zhang, Jianwen Sun, Jun Xiao, Yi Yang, Yawei Luo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced smart education in the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) era. A promising application lies in the automatic generalization of instructional design for curriculum and learning activities, focusing on two key aspects: (1) Customized Generation: generating niche-targeted teaching content based on students' varying learning abilities and states, and (2) Intelligent Optimization: iteratively optimizing content based on feedback from learning effectiveness or test scores. Currently, a single large LLM cannot effectively manage the entire process, posing a challenge for designing intelligent teaching plans. To address these issues, we developed EduPlanner, an LLM-based multi-agent system comprising an evaluator agent, an optimizer agent, and a question analyst, working in adversarial collaboration to generate customized and intelligent instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Taking mathematics lessons as our example, EduPlanner employs a novel Skill-Tree structure to accurately model the background mathematics knowledge of student groups, personalizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities according to students' knowledge levels and learning abilities. Additionally, we introduce the CIDDP, an LLM-based five-dimensional evaluation module encompassing clarity, Integrity, Depth, Practicality, and Pertinence, to comprehensively assess mathematics lesson plan quality and bootstrap intelligent optimization. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and Algebra datasets demonstrate that EduPlanner excels in evaluating and optimizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Ablation studies further validate the significance and effectiveness of each component within the framework. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present VAPO, Value-based Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization framework for reasoning models., a novel framework tailored for reasoning models within the value-based paradigm. Benchmarked the AIME 2024 dataset, VAPO, built on the Qwen 32B pre-trained model, attains a state-of-the-art score of $\mathbf{60.4}$. In direct comparison under identical experimental settings, VAPO outperforms the previously reported results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B and DAPO by more than 10 points. The training process of VAPO stands out for its stability and efficiency. It reaches state-of-the-art performance within a mere 5,000 steps. Moreover, across multiple independent runs, no training crashes occur, underscoring its reliability. This research delves into long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning using a value-based reinforcement learning framework. We pinpoint three key challenges that plague value-based methods: value model bias, the presence of heterogeneous sequence lengths, and the sparsity of reward signals. Through systematic design, VAPO offers an integrated solution that effectively alleviates these challenges, enabling enhanced performance in long-CoT reasoning tasks.

- **[Recitation over Reasoning: How Cutting-Edge Language Models Can Fail on Elementary School-Level Reasoning Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00509)**  `arXiv:2504.00509`  
  _Kai Yan, Yufei Xu, Zhengyin Du, Xuesong Yao, Zheyu Wang, Xiaowen Guo, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid escalation from elementary school-level to frontier problems of the difficulty for LLM benchmarks in recent years have weaved a miracle for researchers that we are only inches away from surpassing human intelligence. However, is the LLMs' remarkable reasoning ability indeed comes from true intelligence by human standards, or are they simply reciting solutions witnessed during training at an Internet level? To study this problem, we propose RoR-Bench, a novel, multi-modal benchmark for detecting LLM's recitation behavior when asked simple reasoning problems but with conditions subtly shifted, and conduct empirical analysis on our benchmark. Surprisingly, we found existing cutting-edge LLMs unanimously exhibits extremely severe recitation behavior; by changing one phrase in the condition, top models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 can suffer $60\%$ performance loss on elementary school-level arithmetic and reasoning problems. Such findings are a wake-up call to the LLM community that compels us to re-evaluate the true intelligence level of cutting-edge LLMs.

  _Qian Long, Ruoyan Li, Minglu Zhao, Tao Gao, Demetri Terzopoulos_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A major challenge for Multi-Agent Systems is enabling agents to adapt dynamically to diverse environments in which opponents and teammates may continually change. Agents trained using conventional methods tend to excel only within the confines of their training cohorts; their performance drops significantly when confronting unfamiliar agents. To address this shortcoming, we introduce Inverse Attention Agents that adopt concepts from the Theory of Mind (ToM) implemented algorithmically using an attention mechanism trained in an end-to-end manner. Crucial to determining the final actions of these agents, the weights in their attention model explicitly represent attention to different goals. We furthermore propose an inverse attention network that deduces the ToM of agents based on observations and prior actions. The network infers the attentional states of other agents, thereby refining the attention weights to adjust the agent's final action. We conduct experiments in a continuous environment, tackling demanding tasks encompassing cooperation, competition, and a blend of both. They demonstrate that the inverse attention network successfully infers the attention of other agents, and that this information improves agent performance. Additional human experiments show that, compared to baseline agent models, our inverse attention agents exhibit superior cooperation with humans and better emulate human behaviors.

  _Nikolai Rozanov, Marek Rei_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents, tackling tasks from robotics to web navigation. Their performance depends on the underlying base agent. Existing methods, however, struggle with long-context reasoning and goal adherence. We introduce StateAct, a novel and efficient base agent that enhances decision-making through (1) self-prompting, which reinforces task goals at every step, and (2) chain-of-states, an extension of chain-of-thought that tracks state information over time. StateAct outperforms ReAct, the previous best base agent, by over 10% on Alfworld, 30% on Textcraft, and 7% on Webshop across multiple frontier LLMs. We also demonstrate that StateAct can be used as a drop-in replacement for ReAct with advanced LLM agent methods such as test-time scaling, yielding an additional 12% gain on Textcraft.

  _Wenxuan Zhang, Philip H.S. Torr, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Adel Bibi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on human preferences, typically through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has proven successful in enhancing their capabilities. However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture the global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark that includes comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO achieves the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor with less than 10\% of the computational resources and human prompting and annotation process.

  _Aniket Vashishtha, Abbavaram Gowtham Reddy, Abhinav Kumar, Saketh Bachu, Vineeth N Balasubramanian, Amit Sharma_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used as experts to infer causal graphs, often by repeatedly applying a pairwise prompt that asks about the causal relationship of each variable pair. However, such experts, including human domain experts, cannot distinguish between direct and indirect effects given a pairwise prompt. Therefore, instead of the graph, we propose that causal order be used as a more stable output interface for utilizing expert knowledge. Even when querying a perfect expert with a pairwise prompt, we show that the inferred graph can have significant errors whereas the causal order is always correct. In practice, however, LLMs are imperfect experts and we find that pairwise prompts lead to multiple cycles. Hence, we propose the triplet method, a novel querying strategy that introduces an auxiliary variable for every variable pair and instructs the LLM to avoid cycles within this triplet. It then uses a voting-based ensemble method that results in higher accuracy and fewer cycles while ensuring cost efficiency. Across multiple real-world graphs, such a triplet-based method yields a more accurate order than the pairwise prompt, using both LLMs and human annotators. The triplet method enhances robustness by repeatedly querying an expert with different auxiliary variables, enabling smaller models like Phi-3 and Llama-3 8B Instruct to surpass GPT-4 with pairwise prompting. For practical usage, we show how the expert-provided causal order from the triplet method can be used to reduce error in downstream graph discovery and effect inference tasks.

  _Krithi Shailya, Shreya Rajpal, Gokul S Krishnan, Balaraman Ravindran_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations. These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key. In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations. Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness. To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT) (The code and set up to reproduce our experiments are publicly available atthis https URL). Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models. Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations. On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models. This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond.

  _Biao Zhang, Fedor Moiseev, Joshua Ainslie, Paul Suganthan, Min Ma, Surya Bhupatiraju, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While decoder-only large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive results, encoder-decoder models are still widely adopted in real-world applications for their inference efficiency and richer encoder representation. In this paper, we study a novel problem: adapting pretrained decoder-only LLMs to encoder-decoder, with the goal of leveraging the strengths of both approaches to achieve a more favorable quality-efficiency trade-off. We argue that adaptation not only enables inheriting the capability of decoder-only LLMs but also reduces the demand for computation compared to pretraining from scratch. We rigorously explore different pretraining objectives and parameter initialization/optimization techniques. Through extensive experiments based on Gemma 2 (2B and 9B) and a suite of newly pretrained mT5-sized models (up to 1.6B), we demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptation and the advantage of encoder-decoder LLMs. Under similar inference budget, encoder-decoder LLMs achieve comparable (often better) pretraining performance but substantially better finetuning performance than their decoder-only counterpart. For example, Gemma 2B-2B outperforms Gemma 2B by $\sim$7\% after instruction tuning. Encoder-decoder adaptation also allows for flexible combination of different-sized models, where Gemma 9B-2B significantly surpasses Gemma 2B-2B by $>$3\%. The adapted encoder representation also yields better results on SuperGLUE. We will release our checkpoints to facilitate future research.

  _Dongyang Fan, Vinko Sabolƒçec, Matin Ansaripour, Ayush Kumar Tarun, Martin Jaggi, Antoine Bosselut, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing adoption of web crawling opt-outs by copyright holders of online content raises critical questions about the impact of data compliance on large language model (LLM) performance. However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the $\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-context capabilities are essential for a wide range of applications, including document and video understanding, in-context learning, and inference-time scaling, all of which require models to process and reason over long sequences of text and multimodal data. In this work, we introduce a efficient training recipe for building ultra-long context LLMs from aligned instruct model, pushing the boundaries of context lengths from 128K to 1M, 2M, and 4M tokens. Our approach leverages efficient continued pretraining strategies to extend the context window and employs effective instruction tuning to maintain the instruction-following and reasoning abilities. Our UltraLong-8B, built on Llama3.1-Instruct with our recipe, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of long-context benchmarks. Importantly, models trained with our approach maintain competitive performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating balanced improvements for both long and short context tasks. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key design choices, highlighting the impacts of scaling strategies and data composition. Our findings establish a robust framework for efficiently scaling context lengths while preserving general model capabilities. We release all model weights at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sarcasm detection is challenging for both humans and machines. This work explores how model characteristics impact sarcasm detection in OpenAI's GPT, and Meta's Llama-2 models, given their strong natural language understanding, and popularity. We evaluate fine-tuned and zero-shot models across various sizes, releases, and hyperparameters. Experiments were conducted on the political and balanced (pol-bal) portion of the popular Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC2.0) sarcasm dataset. Fine-tuned performance improves monotonically with model size within a model family, while hyperparameter tuning also impacts performance. In the fine-tuning scenario, full precision Llama-2-13b achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and $F_1$-score, both measured at 0.83, comparable to average human performance. In the zero-shot setting, one GPT-4 model achieves competitive performance to prior attempts, yielding an accuracy of 0.70 and an $F_1$-score of 0.75. Furthermore, a model's performance may increase or decline with each release, highlighting the need to reassess performance after each release.

  _Seunghyun Ji, Soowon Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked language modeling, which is a task to predict a randomly masked word in the input text, is an efficient language representation learning method. Masked language modeling ignores various words which people can think of for filling in the masked position and calculates the loss with a single word. Especially when the input text is short, the entropy of the word distribution that can fill in the masked position can be high. This may cause the model to be overconfident in the single answer. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence regularizer that controls regularizing strength dynamically by the input text length. Experiments with GLUE and SQuAD datasets showed that our method achieves better accuracy and lower expected calibration error.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) rely on contextual embeddings which generate different (continuous) representations for the same token depending on its surrounding context. Nonetheless, words and tokens typically have a limited number of senses (or meanings). We propose multi-sense embeddings as a drop-in replacement for each token in order to capture the range of their uses in a language. To construct a sense embedding dictionary, we apply a clustering algorithm to embeddings generated by an LLM and consider the cluster centers as representative sense embeddings. In addition, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method that leverages the sense dictionary to learn a smaller student model that mimics the senses from the much larger base LLM model, offering significant space and inference time savings, while maintaining competitive performance. Via thorough experiments on various benchmarks, we showcase the effectiveness of our sense embeddings and knowledge distillation approach. We share our code atthis https URL

  Developing high-quality large language models (LLMs) for moderately resourced languages presents unique challenges in data availability, model adaptation, and evaluation. We introduce Llama-3-Nanda-10B-Chat, or Nanda for short, a state-of-the-art Hindi-centric instruction-tuned generative LLM, designed to push the boundaries of open-source Hindi language models. Built upon Llama-3-8B, Nanda incorporates continuous pre-training with expanded transformer blocks, leveraging the Llama Pro methodology. A key challenge was the limited availability of high-quality Hindi text data; we addressed this through rigorous data curation, augmentation, and strategic bilingual training, balancing Hindi and English corpora to optimize cross-linguistic knowledge transfer. With 10 billion parameters, Nanda stands among the top-performing open-source Hindi and multilingual models of similar scale, demonstrating significant advantages over many existing models. We provide an in-depth discussion of training strategies, fine-tuning techniques, safety alignment, and evaluation metrics, demonstrating how these approaches enabled Nanda to achieve state-of-the-art results. By open-sourcing Nanda, we aim to advance research in Hindi LLMs and support a wide range of real-world applications across academia, industry, and public services.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about cultural bias, fairness, and their applicability in diverse linguistic and underrepresented regional contexts. To enhance and benchmark the capabilities of LLMs, there is a need to develop large-scale resources focused on multilingual, local, and cultural contexts. In this study, we propose a framework, NativQA, that can seamlessly construct large-scale, culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages. The framework utilizes user-defined seed queries and leverages search engines to collect location-specific, everyday information. It has been evaluated across 39 locations in 24 countries and in 7 languages, ranging from extremely low-resource to high-resource languages, which resulted over 300K Question Answer (QA) pairs. The developed resources can be used for LLM benchmarking and further fine-tuning. The framework has been made publicly available for the community (this https URL).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work presents the task of unsupervised location mapping, which seeks to map the trajectory of an individual narrative on a spatial map of locations in which a large set of narratives take place. Despite the fundamentality and generality of the task, very little work addressed the spatial mapping of narrative texts. The task consists of two parts: (1) inducing a ``map'' with the locations mentioned in a set of texts, and (2) extracting a trajectory from a single narrative and positioning it on the map. Following recent advances in increasing the context length of large language models, we propose a pipeline for this task in a completely unsupervised manner without predefining the set of labels. We test our method on two different domains: (1) Holocaust testimonies and (2) Lake District writing, namely multi-century literature on travels in the English Lake District. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations for the task, with encouraging results, thereby setting a benchmark and evaluation practices for the task, as well as highlighting challenges.

  Large language models show promising results in various NLP tasks. Despite these successes, the robustness and consistency of LLMs in underrepresented languages remain largely unexplored, especially concerning local dialects. Existing benchmarks also focus on main dialects, neglecting LLMs' ability on local dialect texts. In this paper, we introduce a Thai local dialect benchmark covering Northern (Lanna), Northeastern (Isan), and Southern (Dambro) Thai, evaluating LLMs on five NLP tasks: summarization, question answering, translation, conversation, and food-related tasks. Furthermore, we propose a human evaluation guideline and metric for Thai local dialects to assess generation fluency and dialect-specific accuracy. Results show that LLM performance declines significantly in local Thai dialects compared to standard Thai, with only proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 demonstrating some fluency

  Large language models have made significant advancements in various natural language processing tasks, including coreference resolution. However, traditional methods often fall short in effectively distinguishing referential relationships due to a lack of integration between syntactic and semantic information. This study introduces an innovative framework aimed at enhancing coreference resolution by utilizing pretrained language models. Our approach combines syntax parsing with semantic role labeling to accurately capture finer distinctions in referential relationships. By employing state-of-the-art pretrained models to gather contextual embeddings and applying an attention mechanism for fine-tuning, we improve the performance of coreference tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets show that our method surpasses conventional coreference resolution systems, achieving notable accuracy in disambiguating references. This development not only improves coreference resolution outcomes but also positively impacts other natural language processing tasks that depend on precise referential understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on preference alignment methods to steer outputs toward human values, yet these methods are often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality human-annotated data. To tackle this, recent approaches have turned to synthetic data generated by LLMs as a scalable alternative. However, synthetic data can introduce distribution shifts, compromising the nuanced human preferences that are essential for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment in the presence of such shifts. Our approach first estimates the likelihood ratios between the target and training distributions leveraging a learned classifier, then it minimizes the worst-case loss over data regions that reflect the target human-preferred distribution. By explicitly prioritizing the target distribution during optimization, our method mitigates the adverse effects of distributional variation and enhances the generation of responses that faithfully reflect human values.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In order to obtain a stochastic model that accounts for the stochastic aspects of the dynamics of a business process, usually the following steps are taken. Given an event log, a process tree is obtained through a process discovery algorithm, i.e., a process tree that is aimed at reproducing, as accurately as possible, the language of the log. The process tree is then transformed into a Petri net that generates the same set of sequences as the process tree. In order to capture the frequency of the sequences in the event log, weights are assigned to the transitions of the Petri net, resulting in a stochastic Petri net with a stochastic language in which each sequence is associated with a probability. In this paper we show that this procedure has unfavorable properties. First, the weights assigned to the transitions of the Petri net have an unclear role in the resulting stochastic language. We will show that a weight can have multiple, ambiguous impact on the probability of the sequences generated by the Petri net. Second, a number of different Petri nets with different number of transitions can correspond to the same process tree. This means that the number of parameters (the number of weights) that determines the stochastic language is not well-defined. In order to avoid these ambiguities, in this paper, we propose to add stochasticity directly to process trees. The result is a new formalism, called stochastic process trees, in which the number of parameters and their role in the associated stochastic language is clear and well-defined.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Embedding fusion has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing performance across various NLP tasks. However, systematic guidelines for selecting optimal layers and developing effective fusion strategies for the integration of LLMs remain underexplored. In this study, we propose a layer-aware embedding selection method and investigate how to quantitatively evaluate different layers to identify the most important ones for downstream NLP tasks, showing that the critical layers vary depending on the dataset. We also explore how combining embeddings from multiple LLMs, without requiring model fine-tuning, can improve performance. Experiments on four English text classification datasets (SST-2, MR, R8, and R52) demonstrate that different layers in LLMs exhibit varying degrees of representational strength for classification, and that combining embeddings from different models can enhance performance if the models exhibit complementary characteristics. Additionally, we discuss resources overhead (memory and inference time) to provide a balanced perspective on the real world feasibility of embedding fusion. Future work will explore multilingual and domain specific datasets, as well as techniques for automating layer selection, to improve both performance and scalability.

  As text and code resources have expanded, large-scale pre-trained models have shown promising capabilities in code generation tasks, typically employing supervised fine-tuning with problem statement-program pairs. However, increasing model size and data volume for performance gains also raises computational demands and risks of overfitting. Addressing these challenges, we present RETROcode, a novel adaptation of the RETRO architecture \cite{RETRO} for sequence-to-sequence models, utilizing a large code database as an auxiliary scaling method. This approach, diverging from simply enlarging model and dataset sizes, allows RETROcode to leverage a vast code database for prediction, enhancing the model's efficiency by integrating extensive memory. Our findings indicate that RETROcode not only outperforms similar-sized traditional architectures on test sets but also approaches the effectiveness of the much larger Codex model, despite being trained from scratch on a substantially smaller dataset.

  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dominated much of the artificial intelligence scene with their ability to process and generate natural languages. However, the majority of LLM research and development remains English-centric, leaving low-resource languages such as those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region under-represented. To address this representation gap, we introduce Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT and Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT, two cutting-edge multilingual LLMs designed for SEA languages. The SEA-LION family of LLMs supports 11 SEA languages, namely English, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Malay, Thai, Burmese, Lao, Filipino, Tamil, and Khmer. Our work leverages large-scale multilingual continued pre-training with a comprehensive post-training regime involving multiple stages of instruction fine-tuning, alignment, and model merging. Evaluation results on multilingual benchmarks indicate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across LLMs supporting SEA languages. We open-source the models to benefit the wider SEA community.

  In recent years, large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a variety of tasks. However, their potential in the domain of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) remains largely underexplored. Moreover, compared to English data, the methods for Chinese AES is not well developed. In this paper, we propose Rank-Then-Score (RTS), a fine-tuning framework based on large language models to enhance their essay scoring capabilities. Specifically, we fine-tune the ranking model (Ranker) with feature-enriched data, and then feed the output of the ranking model, in the form of a candidate score set, with the essay content into the scoring model (Scorer) to produce the final score. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, HSK and ASAP, demonstrate that RTS consistently outperforms the direct prompting (Vanilla) method in terms of average QWK across all LLMs and datasets, and achieves the best performance on Chinese essay scoring using the HSK dataset.

While short-to-long generations have received considerable attention, generating long texts from extremely long resources remains relatively underexplored. The primary challenge in long-to-long generation lies in effectively integrating and analyzing relevant information from extensive inputs, which remains difficult for current large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2, a novel test-time scaling strategy designed to enhance the ability of LLMs to process extremely long inputs. Drawing inspiration from convolutional neural networks, which iteratively integrate local features into higher-level global representations, LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2 utilizes stacked convolutional scaling layers to progressively expand the understanding of input materials. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the ability of LLMs to process long inputs and generate coherent, informative long-form articles, outperforming several representative baselines.

  A random sample of nearly 10 hours of speech from PennSound, the world's largest online collection of poetry readings and discussions, was used as a benchmark to evaluate several commercial and open-source speech-to-text systems. PennSound's wide variation in recording conditions and speech styles makes it a good representative for many other untranscribed audio collections. Reference transcripts were created by trained annotators, and system transcripts were produced from AWS, Azure, Google, IBM, NeMo,this http URL, Whisper, andthis http URL. Based on word error rate,this http URLwas the top performer, and Whisper was the top open source performer (as long as hallucinations were avoided). AWS had the best diarization error rates among three systems. However, WER and DER differences were slim, and various tradeoffs may motivate choosing different systems for different end users. We also examine the issue of hallucinations in Whisper. Users of Whisper should be cautioned to be aware of runtime options, and whether the speed vs accuracy trade off is acceptable.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatically assessing question quality is crucial for educators as it saves time, ensures consistency, and provides immediate feedback for refining teaching materials. We propose a novel methodology called STRIVE (Structured Thinking and Refinement with multiLLMs for Improving Verified Question Estimation) using a series of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic question evaluation. This approach aims to improve the accuracy and depth of question quality assessment, ultimately supporting diverse learners and enhancing educational practices. The method estimates question quality in an automated manner by generating multiple evaluations based on the strengths and weaknesses of the provided question and then choosing the best solution generated by the LLM. Then the process is improved by iterative review and response with another LLM until the evaluation metric values converge. This sophisticated method of evaluating question quality improves the estimation of question quality by automating the task of question quality evaluation. Correlation scores show that using this proposed method helps to improve correlation with human judgments compared to the baseline method. Error analysis shows that metrics like relevance and appropriateness improve significantly relative to human judgments by using STRIVE.

  This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance of prominent pre-trained large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, text-davinci-003, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001, text-ada-001, llama-2-7b-chat, llama-2-13b-chat, and llama-2-70b-chat, in comparison to expert human evaluators in providing scores, identifying errors, and offering feedback and improvement suggestions to candidates during mock HR (Human Resources) interviews. We introduce a dataset called HURIT (Human Resource Interview Transcripts), which comprises 3,890 HR interview transcripts sourced from real-world HR interview scenarios. Our findings reveal that pre-trained LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo, exhibit commendable performance and are capable of producing evaluations comparable to those of expert human evaluators. Although these LLMs demonstrate proficiency in providing scores comparable to human experts in terms of human evaluation metrics, they frequently fail to identify errors and offer specific actionable advice for candidate performance improvement in HR interviews. Our research suggests that the current state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs are not fully conducive for automatic deployment in an HR interview assessment. Instead, our findings advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach, to incorporate manual checks for inconsistencies and provisions for improving feedback quality as a more suitable strategy.

  We propose a novel three-step prompt-tuning method for Bengali Grammatical Error Explanation (BGEE) using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and Llama-2-70b. Our approach involves identifying and categorizing grammatical errors in Bengali sentences, generating corrected versions of the sentences, and providing natural language explanations for each identified error. We evaluate the performance of our BGEE system using both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation conducted by experienced Bengali language experts. Our proposed prompt-tuning approach shows that GPT-4, the best performing LLM, surpasses the baseline model in automated evaluation metrics, with a 5.26% improvement in F1 score and a 6.95% improvement in exact match. Furthermore, compared to the previous baseline, GPT-4 demonstrates a decrease of 25.51% in wrong error type and a decrease of 26.27% in wrong error explanation. However, the results still lag behind the human baseline.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large-scale generative language models have shown that reasoning capabilities can significantly improve model performance across a variety of tasks. However, the impact of reasoning on a model's ability to mitigate stereotypical responses remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate the crucial relationship between a model's reasoning ability and fairness, and ask whether improved reasoning capabilities can mitigate harmful stereotypical responses, especially those arising due to shallow or flawed reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multiple open-source LLMs, and find that larger models with stronger reasoning abilities exhibit substantially lower stereotypical bias on existing fairness benchmarks. Building on this insight, we introduce ReGiFT -- Reasoning Guided Fine-Tuning, a novel approach that extracts structured reasoning traces from advanced reasoning models and infuses them into models that lack such capabilities. We use only general-purpose reasoning and do not require any fairness-specific supervision for bias mitigation. Notably, we see that models fine-tuned using ReGiFT not only improve fairness relative to their non-reasoning counterparts but also outperform advanced reasoning models on fairness benchmarks. We also analyze how variations in the correctness of the reasoning traces and their length influence model fairness and their overall performance. Our findings highlight that enhancing reasoning capabilities is an effective, fairness-agnostic strategy for mitigating stereotypical bias caused by reasoning flaws.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can enhance translation quality through self-refinement. In this paper, we build on this idea by extending the refinement from sentence-level to document-level translation, specifically focusing on document-to-document (Doc2Doc) translation refinement. Since sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) and Doc2Doc translation address different aspects of the translation process, we propose fine-tuning LLMs for translation refinement using two intermediate translations, combining the strengths of both Sent2Sent and Doc2Doc. Additionally, recognizing that the quality of intermediate translations varies, we introduce an enhanced fine-tuning method with quality awareness that assigns lower weights to easier translations and higher weights to more difficult ones, enabling the model to focus on challenging translation cases. Experimental results across ten translation tasks with LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo-Instruct demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  Extractive reading comprehension systems are designed to locate the correct answer to a question within a given text. However, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring these models maintain high accuracy in answering questions while reliably recognizing unanswerable queries. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) for reading comprehension, this issue remains critical, particularly as the length of supported contexts continues to expand. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative data augmentation methodology grounded in a multi-agent collaborative framework. Unlike traditional methods, such as the costly human annotation process required for datasets like SQuAD 2.0, our method autonomously generates evidence-based question-answer pairs and systematically constructs unanswerable questions. Using this methodology, we developed the FactGuard-Bench dataset, which comprises 25,220 examples of both answerable and unanswerable question scenarios, with context lengths ranging from 8K to 128K. Experimental evaluations conducted on seven popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced models achieve only 61.79% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of a model's ability to reason about unanswerable questions to avoid generating plausible but incorrect answers. By implementing efficient data selection and generation within the multi-agent collaborative framework, our method significantly reduces the traditionally high costs associated with manual annotation and provides valuable insights for the training and optimization of LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, including sentiment analysis. However, data quality--particularly when sourced from social media--can significantly impact their accuracy. This research explores how textual nuances, including emojis and sarcasm, affect sentiment analysis, with a particular focus on improving data quality through text paraphrasing techniques. To address the lack of labeled sarcasm data, the authors created a human-labeled dataset of 5929 tweets that enabled the assessment of LLM in various sarcasm contexts. The results show that when topic-specific datasets, such as those related to nuclear power, are used to finetune LLMs these models are not able to comprehend accurate sentiment in presence of sarcasm due to less diverse text, requiring external interventions like sarcasm removal to boost model accuracy. Sarcasm removal led to up to 21% improvement in sentiment accuracy, as LLMs trained on nuclear power-related content struggled with sarcastic tweets, achieving only 30% accuracy. In contrast, LLMs trained on general tweet datasets, covering a broader range of topics, showed considerable improvements in predicting sentiment for sarcastic tweets (60% accuracy), indicating that incorporating general text data can enhance sarcasm detection. The study also utilized adversarial text augmentation, showing that creating synthetic text variants by making minor changes significantly increased model robustness and accuracy for sarcastic tweets (approximately 85%). Additionally, text paraphrasing of tweets with fragmented language transformed around 40% of the tweets with low-confidence labels into high-confidence ones, improving LLMs sentiment analysis accuracy by 6%.

  _Hossein Entezari Zarch, Lei Gao, Chaoyi Jiang, Murali Annavaram_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative Decoding (SD) is a widely used approach to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs) without reducing generation quality. It operates by first using a compact model to draft multiple tokens efficiently, followed by parallel verification using the target LLM. This approach leads to faster inference compared to auto-regressive decoding. While there are multiple approaches to create a draft model, one promising approach is to use early-exit methods. These methods draft candidate tokens by using a subset of layers of the primary model and applying the remaining layers for verification, allowing a single model to handle both drafting and verification. While this technique reduces memory usage and computational cost, its performance relies on the choice of the exit layer for drafting and the number of tokens drafted (speculation length) in each SD round. Prior works use hyperparameter exploration to statically select these values. However, our evaluations show that these hyperparameter values are task-specific, and even within a task they are dependent on the current sequence context. We introduce DEL, a plug-and-play method that adaptively selects the exit layer and speculation length during inference. DEL dynamically tracks the token acceptance rate if the tokens are drafted at each layer of an LLM and uses that knowledge to heuristically select the optimal exit layer and speculation length. Our experiments across a broad range of models and downstream tasks show that DEL achieves overall speedups of $2.16\times$$\sim$$2.50\times$ over vanilla auto-regressive decoding and improves upon the state-of-the-art SD methods by up to $0.27\times$.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge during pre-training, they often lack domain-specific, new, or niche information. Continual pre-training (CPT) attempts to address this gap but suffers from catastrophic forgetting and inefficiencies in low-data regimes. We introduce Knowledge-Instruct, a novel approach to efficiently inject knowledge from limited corpora through pure instruction-tuning. By generating information-dense synthetic instruction data, it effectively integrates new knowledge while preserving general reasoning and instruction-following abilities. Knowledge-Instruct demonstrates superior factual memorization, minimizes catastrophic forgetting, and remains scalable by leveraging synthetic data from relatively small language models. Additionally, it enhances contextual understanding, including complex multi-hop reasoning, facilitating integration with retrieval systems. We validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, including Companies, a new dataset that we release to measure knowledge injection capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise as dynamic instructional aids. Yet, it remains unclear whether LLMs can replicate the adaptivity of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS)--where student knowledge and pedagogical strategies are explicitly modeled. We propose a prompt variation framework to assess LLM-generated instructional moves' adaptivity and pedagogical soundness across 75 real-world tutoring scenarios from an ITS. We systematically remove key context components (e.g., student errors and knowledge components) from prompts to create variations of each scenario. Three representative LLMs (Llama3-8B, Llama3-70B, and GPT-4o) generate 1,350 instructional moves. We use text embeddings and randomization tests to measure how the omission of each context feature impacts the LLMs' outputs (adaptivity) and a validated tutor-training classifier to evaluate response quality (pedagogical soundness). Surprisingly, even the best-performing model only marginally mimics the adaptivity of ITS. Specifically, Llama3-70B demonstrates statistically significant adaptivity to student errors. Although Llama3-8B's recommendations receive higher pedagogical soundness scores than the other models, it struggles with instruction-following behaviors, including output formatting. By contrast, GPT-4o reliably adheres to instructions but tends to provide overly direct feedback that diverges from effective tutoring, prompting learners with open-ended questions to gauge knowledge. Given these results, we discuss how current LLM-based tutoring is unlikely to produce learning benefits rivaling known-to-be-effective ITS tutoring. Through our open-source benchmarking code, we contribute a reproducible method for evaluating LLMs' instructional adaptivity and fidelity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has achieved remarkable success. However, existing Chinese preference datasets are limited by small scale, narrow domain coverage, and lack of rigorous data validation. Additionally, the reliance on human annotators for instruction and response labeling significantly constrains the scalability of human preference datasets. To address these challenges, we design an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset annotation pipeline with no human intervention. Specifically, we crawled and carefully filtered 92k high-quality Chinese queries and employed 15 mainstream LLMs to generate and score chosen-rejected response pairs. Based on it, we introduce COIG-P (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist - Preference), a high-quality, large-scale Chinese preference dataset, comprises 1,009k Chinese preference pairs spanning 6 diverse domains: Chat, Code, Math, Logic, Novel, and Role. Building upon COIG-P, to reduce the overhead of using LLMs for scoring, we trained a 8B-sized Chinese Reward Model (CRM) and meticulously constructed a Chinese Reward Benchmark (CRBench). Evaluation results based on AlignBench \citep{liu2024alignbenchbenchmarkingchinesealignment} show that that COIG-P significantly outperforms other Chinese preference datasets, and it brings significant performance improvements ranging from 2% to 12% for the Qwen2/2.5 and Infinity-Instruct-3M-0625 model series, respectively. The results on CRBench demonstrate that our CRM has a strong and robust scoring ability. We apply it to filter chosen-rejected response pairs in a test split of COIG-P, and our experiments show that it is comparable to GPT-4o in identifying low-quality samples while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

  This paper introduces a novel integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with Extended Reality (XR) technologies to address knowledge transfer challenges in industrial environments. The proposed system embeds domain-specific industrial knowledge into XR environments through a natural language interface, enabling hands-free, context-aware expert guidance for workers. We present the architecture of the proposed system consisting of an LLM Chat Engine with dynamic tool orchestration and an XR application featuring voice-driven interaction. Performance evaluation of various chunking strategies, embedding models, and vector databases reveals that semantic chunking, balanced embedding models, and efficient vector stores deliver optimal performance for industrial knowledge retrieval. The system's potential is demonstrated through early implementation in multiple industrial use cases, including robotic assembly, smart infrastructure maintenance, and aerospace component servicing. Results indicate potential for enhancing training efficiency, remote assistance capabilities, and operational guidance in alignment with Industry 5.0's human-centric and resilient approach to industrial development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential as tools for scientific discovery. This has engendered growing interest in their use in humanistic disciplines, such as historical linguistics and literary studies. These fields often construct arguments on the basis of delineations like genre, or more inflexibly, time period. Although efforts have been made to restrict inference to specific domains via fine-tuning or model editing, we posit that the only true guarantee is domain-restricted pretraining -- typically, a data- and compute-expensive proposition.We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over corpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for "typical" LLM approaches. We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a temporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices. We train two corresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned.We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned baselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus. Emphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a number of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target fields. Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method enables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical change, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense introduction/obsolescence. We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows extension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.

  Charts are ubiquitous, as people often use them to analyze data, answer questions, and discover critical insights. However, performing complex analytical tasks with charts requires significant perceptual and cognitive effort. Chart Question Answering (CQA) systems automate this process by enabling models to interpret and reason with visual representations of data. However, existing benchmarks like ChartQA lack real-world diversity and have recently shown performance saturation with modern large vision-language models (LVLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce ChartQAPro, a new benchmark that includes 1,341 charts from 157 diverse sources, spanning various chart types, including infographics and dashboards, and featuring 1,948 questions in various types, such as multiple-choice, conversational, hypothetical, and unanswerable questions, to better reflect real-world challenges. Our evaluations with 21 models show a substantial performance drop for LVLMs on ChartQAPro; e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.5 scores 90.5% on ChartQA but only 55.81% on ChartQAPro, underscoring the complexity of chart reasoning. We complement our findings with detailed error analyses and ablation studies, identifying key challenges and opportunities for advancing LVLMs in chart understanding and reasoning. We release ChartQAPro atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent advancements in automatic summarization, state-of-the-art models do not summarize all documents equally well, raising the question: why? While prior research has extensively analyzed summarization models, little attention has been given to the role of document characteristics in influencing summarization performance. In this work, we explore two key research questions. First, do documents exhibit consistent summarization quality across multiple systems? If so, can we predict a document's summarization performance without generating a summary? We answer both questions affirmatively and introduce PreSumm, a novel task in which a system predicts summarization performance based solely on the source document. Our analysis sheds light on common properties of documents with low PreSumm scores, revealing that they often suffer from coherence issues, complex content, or a lack of a clear main theme. In addition, we demonstrate PreSumm's practical utility in two key applications: improving hybrid summarization workflows by identifying documents that require manual summarization and enhancing dataset quality by filtering outliers and noisy documents. Overall, our findings highlight the critical role of document properties in summarization performance and offer insights into the limitations of current systems that could serve as the basis for future improvements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personality detection automatically identifies an individual's personality from various data sources, such as social media texts. However, as the parameter scale of language models continues to grow, the computational cost becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Fine-tuning also grows more complex, making it harder to justify the effort and reliably predict outcomes. We introduce a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, PersLLM, to address these challenges. In PersLLM, a large language model (LLM) extracts high-dimensional representations from raw data and stores them in a dynamic memory layer. PersLLM then updates the downstream layers with a replaceable output network, enabling flexible adaptation to various personality detection scenarios. By storing the features in the memory layer, we eliminate the need for repeated complex computations by the LLM. Meanwhile, the lightweight output network serves as a proxy for evaluating the overall effectiveness of the framework, improving the predictability of results. Experimental results on key benchmark datasets like Kaggle and Pandora show that PersLLM significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining competitive performance and strong adaptability.

  The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.

  Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on standard benchmarks, yet they struggle increasingly from mode collapse, the inability to generate diverse and novel outputs. Our work introduces NoveltyBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of language models to produce multiple distinct and high-quality outputs. NoveltyBench utilizes prompts curated to elicit diverse answers and filtered real-world user queries. Evaluating 20 leading language models, we find that current state-of-the-art systems generate significantly less diversity than human writers. Notably, larger models within a family often exhibit less diversity than their smaller counterparts, challenging the notion that capability on standard benchmarks translates directly to generative utility. While prompting strategies like in-context regeneration can elicit diversity, our findings highlight a fundamental lack of distributional diversity in current models, reducing their utility for users seeking varied responses and suggesting the need for new training and evaluation paradigms that prioritize diversity alongside quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning is concerned with the task of removing knowledge learned from particular data points from a trained model. In the context of large language models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention, particularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for privacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the unlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be unlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is treated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of this paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does not hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on the frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a model and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent knowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between probability and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this problem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the need for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that take the training data of models into account.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized their ability to handle single-turn tasks, yet real-world applications demand sophisticated multi-turn interactions. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available atthis https URL.

  As language models achieve increasingly human-like capabilities in conversational text generation, a critical question emerges: to what extent can these systems simulate the characteristics of specific individuals? To evaluate this, we introduce IMPersona, a framework for evaluating LMs at impersonating specific individuals' writing style and personal knowledge. Using supervised fine-tuning and a hierarchical memory-inspired retrieval system, we demonstrate that even modestly sized open-source models, such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, can achieve impersonation abilities at concerning levels. In blind conversation experiments, participants (mis)identified our fine-tuned models with memory integration as human in 44.44% of interactions, compared to just 25.00% for the best prompting-based approach. We analyze these results to propose detection methods and defense strategies against such impersonation attempts. Our findings raise important questions about both the potential applications and risks of personalized language models, particularly regarding privacy, security, and the ethical deployment of such technologies in real-world contexts.

  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about concerns regarding copyright infringement and unethical practices in data and model usage. For instance, slight modifications to existing LLMs may be used to falsely claim the development of new models, leading to issues of model copying and violations of ownership rights. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel metric for quantifying LLM similarity, which leverages perplexity curves and differences in Menger curvature. Comprehensive experiments validate the performance of our methodology, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods and its ability to generalize across diverse models and domains. Furthermore, we highlight the capability of our approach in detecting model replication through simulations, emphasizing its potential to preserve the originality and integrity of LLMs. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source both the synthetic data collected and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-form video processing fundamentally challenges vision-language models (VLMs) due to the high computational costs of handling extended temporal sequences. Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice critical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce differential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves task-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this principle, we develop ViLaMP, a hierarchical video-language model that processes hour-long videos at ``mixed precision'' through two key mechanisms: (1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while maintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential feature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the patch level. Hence, ViLaMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing non-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision training. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLaMP's superior performance across four video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content. Notably, ViLaMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

  Recent advancements in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), applied during the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced their capabilities in structured reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logical inference. However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong performance in multilingual question-answering (QA) tasks by leveraging relevant passages retrieved from corpora. In multilingual RAG (mRAG), the retrieved passages can be written in languages other than that of the query entered by the user, making it challenging for LLMs to effectively utilize the provided information. Recent research suggests that retrieving passages from multilingual corpora can improve RAG performance, particularly for low-resource languages. However, the extent to which LLMs can leverage different kinds of multilingual contexts to generate accurate answers, *independently from retrieval quality*, remains understudied. In this paper, we conduct an extensive assessment of LLMs' ability to (i) make consistent use of a relevant passage regardless of its language, (ii) respond in the expected language, and (iii) focus on the relevant passage even when multiple `distracting' passages in different languages are provided in the context. Our experiments with four LLMs across three QA datasets covering a total of 48 languages reveal a surprising ability of LLMs to extract the relevant information from out-language passages, but a much weaker ability to formulate a full answer in the correct language. Our analysis, based on both accuracy and feature attribution techniques, further shows that distracting passages negatively impact answer quality regardless of their language. However, distractors in the query language exert a slightly stronger influence. Taken together, our findings deepen the understanding of how LLMs utilize context in mRAG systems, providing directions for future improvements.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across various domains spanning search engines, code generation, and text creation. However, a major concern associated with their adoption is the high cost of inference, impacting both their sustainability and financial feasibility. In this study, we empirically study how different prompt and response characteristics directly impact LLM inference energy cost. We conduct experiments leveraging three open-source transformer-based LLMs across three task types$-$question answering, sentiment analysis, and text generation. For each inference, we analyzed prompt and response characteristics (length, semantic meaning, time taken, energy consumption). Our results demonstrate that even when presented with identical tasks, models generate responses with varying characteristics and subsequently exhibit distinct energy consumption patterns. We found that prompt length is less significant than the semantic meaning of the task itself. In addition, we identified specific keywords associated with higher or lower energy usage that vary between associated tasks. These findings highlight the importance of prompt design in optimizing inference efficiency. We conclude that the semantic meaning of prompts and certain task-related keywords significantly impact inference costs, leading the way for deeper exploration towards creating energy-adaptive LLMs.

  The increasing complexity of LLMs presents significant challenges to their transparency and interpretability, necessitating the use of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance trustworthiness and usability. This study introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework with four novel metrics for assessing the effectiveness of five XAI techniques across five LLMs and two downstream tasks. We apply this framework to evaluate several XAI techniques LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and Attention Mechanism Visualization (AMV) using the IMDB Movie Reviews and Tweet Sentiment Extraction datasets. The evaluation focuses on four key metrics: Human-reasoning Agreement (HA), Robustness, Consistency, and Contrastivity. Our results show that LIME consistently achieves high scores across multiple LLMs and evaluation metrics, while AMV demonstrates superior Robustness and near-perfect Consistency. LRP excels in Contrastivity, particularly with more complex models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different XAI methods, offering guidance for developing and selecting appropriate XAI techniques for LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The performance emergence of large language models (LLMs) driven by data scaling laws makes the selection of pre-training data increasingly important. However, existing methods rely on limited heuristics and human intuition, lacking comprehensive and clear guidelines. To address this, we are inspired by ``reverse thinking'' -- prompting LLMs to self-identify which criteria benefit its performance. As its pre-training capabilities are related to perplexity (PPL), we derive 14 quality criteria from the causes of text perplexity anomalies and introduce 15 common application domains to support domain mixing. In this paper, we train a Data Manager (DataMan) to learn quality ratings and domain recognition from pointwise rating, and use it to annotate a 447B token pre-training corpus with 14 quality ratings and domain type. Our experiments validate our approach, using DataMan to select 30B tokens to train a 1.3B-parameter language model, demonstrating significant improvements in in-context learning (ICL), perplexity, and instruction-following ability over the state-of-the-art baseline. The best-performing model, based on the Overall Score l=5 surpasses a model trained with 50% more data using uniform sampling. We continue pre-training with high-rated, domain-specific data annotated by DataMan to enhance domain-specific ICL performance and thus verify DataMan's domain mixing ability. Our findings emphasize the importance of quality ranking, the complementary nature of quality criteria, and their low correlation with perplexity, analyzing misalignment between PPL and ICL performance. We also thoroughly analyzed our pre-training dataset, examining its composition, the distribution of quality ratings, and the original document sources.

  A significant and growing number of published scientific articles is found to involve fraudulent practices, posing a serious threat to the credibility and safety of research in fields such as medicine. We propose Pub-Guard-LLM, the first large language model-based system tailored to fraud detection of biomedical scientific articles. We provide three application modes for deploying Pub-Guard-LLM: vanilla reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-agent debate. Each mode allows for textual explanations of predictions. To assess the performance of our system, we introduce an open-source benchmark, PubMed Retraction, comprising over 11K real-world biomedical articles, including metadata and retraction labels. We show that, across all modes, Pub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and provides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more relevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by multiple assessment methods. By enhancing both detection performance and explainability in scientific fraud detection, Pub-Guard-LLM contributes to safeguarding research integrity with a novel, effective, open-source tool.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in large language model (LLM) outputs severely limit their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering. To address this challenge, we introduce REFIND (Retrieval-augmented Factuality hallucINation Detection), a novel framework that detects hallucinated spans within LLM outputs by directly leveraging retrieved documents. As part of the REFIND, we propose the Context Sensitivity Ratio (CSR), a novel metric that quantifies the sensitivity of LLM outputs to retrieved evidence. This innovative approach enables REFIND to efficiently and accurately detect hallucinations, setting it apart from existing methods. In the evaluation, REFIND demonstrated robustness across nine languages, including low-resource settings, and significantly outperformed baseline models, achieving superior IoU scores in identifying hallucinated spans. This work highlights the effectiveness of quantifying context sensitivity for hallucination detection, thereby paving the way for more reliable and trustworthy LLM applications across diverse languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for assessing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), as it reveals confidence in predictions, identifies failure modes, and gauges output reliability. Conformal Prediction (CP), a model-agnostic method that generates prediction sets with a specified error rate, has been adopted for UQ in classification tasks, where the size of the prediction set indicates the model's uncertainty. However, when adapting CP to NLG, the sampling-based method for generating candidate outputs cannot guarantee the inclusion of the ground truth, limiting its applicability across a wide range of error rates. To address this, we propose \ourmethod, a method that explicitly adds the ground truth to the candidate outputs and uses logit scores to measure nonconformity. Our experiments with six LLMs on four NLG tasks show that \ourmethod outperforms baseline methods in calibrating error rates and empirical cover rates, offering accurate UQ across a wide range of user-specified error rates.

  Ensuring the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse linguistic settings remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages. Existing safety alignment methods are English-centric, limiting their effectiveness. We systematically compare Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) for aligning SEA-Lion-v2.1-Instruct, a Llama 3-8B variant, to reduce toxicity in Singlish. Our results show that SFT+KTO achieves superior safety alignment with higher sample efficiency than DPO. Additionally, we introduce KTO-S, which enhances stability via improved KL divergence regularization. Our approach reduces Singlish toxicity by 99\%, generalizes to TOXIGEN, and maintains strong performance on standard LLM benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for safer AI deployment in multilingual contexts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) typically relies on producing large sets of input-output pairs. Yet for a given question, there can be many valid outputs. In practice, these outputs are often derived by distilling knowledge from teacher models, and they can vary depending on the specific teacher model or prompting strategy employed. Recent findings show that how these training outputs are generated can significantly affect the performance of the fine-tuned model, raising an important question: how do we pick the best data generation method from among numerous possibilities? Rather than exhaustively training and evaluating on each candidate, this paper proposes a scalable approximate method that assesses a small subset of generated data to estimate its suitability for a specific target LLM. Our central idea is that effective outputs should be familiar to the target LLM. While previous work measures familiarity with perplexity, we find that perplexity might be suboptimal in characterizing 'familiarity' through theoretical analysis and practical observations. To address this, we introduce self-aligned perplexity, a novel metric capturing how closely candidate outputs adhere to the target LLM's own style and reasoning patterns. In this way, we can identify the most effective generation strategy on a small sample, then apply it to produce the complete training set. We demonstrate that training on data generated by the chosen method yields significant improvements across diverse reasoning-focused benchmarks.

  The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.

  Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their superior performance in many knowledge-driven applications on the world widethis http URLmodels are designed to train hundreds of millions or more parameters on large amounts of text data, enabling them to understand and generate naturallanguage effectively. As the superior performance of LLMs becomes apparent,they are increasingly being applied to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) related tasks to improve the processing results. Traditional KGE representation learning methods map entities and relations into a low-dimensional vector space, enablingthe triples in the knowledge graph to satisfy a specific scoring function in thevector space. However, based on the powerful language understanding and seman-tic modeling capabilities of LLMs, that have recently been invoked to varying degrees in different types of KGE related scenarios such as multi-modal KGE andopen KGE according to their task characteristics. In this paper, we investigate awide range of approaches for performing LLMs-related tasks in different types of KGE scenarios. To better compare the various approaches, we summarize each KGE scenario in a classification. Finally, we discuss the applications in which the methods are mainly used and suggest several forward-looking directions for the development of this new research area.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text-to-SQL systems. However, most LLM-based methods often narrowly focus on SQL generation, neglecting the complexities of real-world conversational queries. This oversight can lead to unreliable responses, particularly for ambiguous questions that cannot be directly addressed with SQL. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSQL, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the question classification and SQL generation capabilities of LLMs by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse question types and multi-turn Q&A interactions. Using MMSQL, we assessed the performance of popular LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, and identified key factors impacting their performance in such scenarios. Moreover, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent framework that employs specialized agents to identify question types and determine appropriate answering strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the model's ability to navigate the complexities of conversational dynamics, effectively handling the diverse and complex nature of user queries.

  Indexing is an important step towards strong performance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, existing methods organize data based on either semantic similarity (similarity) or related information (relatedness), but do not cover both perspectives comprehensively. Our analysis reveals that modeling only one perspective results in insufficient knowledge synthesis, leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks requiring multihop reasoning. In this paper, we propose SiReRAG, a novel RAG indexing approach that explicitly considers both similar and related information. On the similarity side, we follow existing work and explore some variances to construct a similarity tree based on recursive summarization. On the relatedness side, SiReRAG extracts propositions and entities from texts, groups propositions via shared entities, and generates recursive summaries to construct a relatedness tree. We index and flatten both similarity and relatedness trees into a unified retrieval pool. Our experiments demonstrate that SiReRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods on three multihop datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA), with an average 1.9% improvement in F1 scores. As a reasonably efficient solution, SiReRAG enhances existing reranking methods significantly, with up to 7.8% improvement in average F1 scores. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Empirical evidence indicates that LLMs exhibit spontaneous cross-lingual alignment. However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in IE, a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal information extraction. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we enhance the model's cross-lingual transferability through IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on a translated instance prediction task we proposed. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages, KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by $30.17\%$ and SoTA by $20.03\%$, thereby demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through boosting the IE alignment.

  Aligning large language models (LLMs) through supervised fine-tuning is essential for tailoring them to specific applications. Recent studies suggest that alignment primarily adjusts a model's presentation style rather than its foundational knowledge, indicating that only certain components of the model are significantly impacted. To uncover how alignment affects model behavior at a granular level, we propose identifying which layers within LLMs are most critical to the alignment process. Our approach, named ILA, involves learning a binary mask for the parameter changes in each layer during alignment, as an indicator of layer significance. Experimental results reveal that, despite substantial differences in alignment datasets, the important layers of a model identified by ILA exhibit nearly 90\% overlap, highlighting fundamental patterns in LLM alignment. The results also indicate that freezing non-essential layers improves overall model performance, while selectively tuning the most critical layers significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency with minimal performance loss. Finally, we discuss how these findings extend from LLM alignment to reasoning.

  As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks.

- **[Scaling Laws for Predicting Downstream Performance in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08527)**  `arXiv:2410.08527`  
  _Yangyi Chen, Binxuan Huang, Yifan Gao, Zhengyang Wang, Jingfeng Yang, Heng Ji_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precise estimation of downstream performance in large language models (LLMs) prior to training is essential for guiding their development process. Scaling laws analysis utilizes the statistics of a series of significantly smaller sampling language models (LMs) to predict the performance of the target LLM. For downstream performance prediction, the critical challenge lies in the emergent abilities in LLMs that occur beyond task-specific computational thresholds. In this work, we focus on the pre-training loss as a more computation-efficient metric for performance estimation. Our two-stage approach FLP consists of first estimating a function that maps computational resources (e.g., FLOPs) to the pre-training Loss using a series of fully-converged sampling models, followed by mapping the pre-training loss to downstream task Performance using the intermediate models with emerged performance. In our experiments, this FLP solution accurately predicts the performance of LLMs with 7B and 13B parameters using a series of sampling LMs up to 3B, achieving error margins of 5% and 10%, respectively, and significantly outperforming the FLOPs-to-Performance approach. Further, we present FLP-M, a fundamental approach for performance prediction that addresses the practical need to integrate datasets from multiple sources during pre-training. FLP-M extends the power law analytical function to predict domain-specific pre-training loss based on FLOPs across data sources, and employs a two-layer neural network to model the non-linear relationship between multiple domain-specific loss and downstream performance. By utilizing a 3B LLM trained on a specific ratio and a series of smaller sampling LMs, FLP-M can effectively forecast the performance of 3B and 7B LLMs across various data mixtures for most benchmarks within 10% error margins.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought have established themselves as a popular vehicle for improving the outputs of large language models (LLMs). For code generation, however, their exact mechanics and efficacy are under-explored. We thus investigate the effects of a wide range of prompting strategies with a focus on automatic re-prompting over multiple turns and computational requirements. After systematically decomposing reasoning, instruction, and execution feedback prompts, we conduct an extensive grid search on the competitive programming benchmarks CodeContests and TACO for multiple LLM families and sizes (Llama 3.0 and 3.1, 8B, 70B, 405B, and GPT-4o). Our study reveals strategies that consistently improve performance across all models with small and large sampling budgets. We then show how finetuning with such an optimal configuration allows models to internalize the induced reasoning process and obtain improvements in performance and scalability for multi-turn code generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unlearning methods have the potential to improve the privacy and safety of large language models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. The LLM unlearning research community has increasingly turned toward empirical benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of such methods. In this paper, we find that existing benchmarks provide an overly optimistic and potentially misleading view on the effectiveness of candidate unlearning methods. By introducing simple, benign modifications to a number of popular benchmarks, we expose instances where supposedly unlearned information remains accessible, or where the unlearning process has degraded the model's performance on retained information to a much greater extent than indicated by the original benchmark. We identify that existing benchmarks are particularly vulnerable to modifications that introduce even loose dependencies between the forget and retain information. Further, we show that ambiguity in unlearning targets in existing benchmarks can easily lead to the design of methods that overfit to the given test queries. Based on our findings, we urge the community to be cautious when interpreting benchmark results as reliable measures of progress, and we provide several recommendations to guide future LLM unlearning research.

  In traditional innovation practices, concept and IP generation are often iteratively integrated. Both processes demand an intricate understanding of advanced technical domain knowledge. Existing large language models (LLMs), while possessing massive pre-trained knowledge, often fall short in the innovative concept generation due to a lack of specialized knowledge necessary for the generation. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a novel knowledge finetuning (KFT) framework to endow LLM-based AI with the ability to autonomously mine, understand, and apply domain-specific knowledge and concepts for invention generation, i.e., concept and patent generation together. Our proposed PatentGPT integrates knowledge injection pre-training (KPT), domain-specific supervised finetuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Extensive evaluation shows that PatentGPT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on patent-related benchmark tests. Our method not only provides new insights into data-driven innovation but also paves a new path to fine-tune LLMs for applications in the context of technology. We also discuss the managerial and policy implications of AI-generating inventions in the future.

  Accurate nutrition estimation helps people make informed dietary choices and is essential in the prevention of serious health complications. We present NutriBench, the first publicly available natural language meal description nutrition benchmark. NutriBench consists of 11,857 meal descriptions generated from real-world global dietary intake data. The data is human-verified and annotated with macro-nutrient labels, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. We conduct an extensive evaluation of NutriBench on the task of carbohydrate estimation, testing twelve leading Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Llama3.1, Qwen2, Gemma2, and OpenBioLLM models, using standard, Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation strategies. Additionally, we present a study involving professional nutritionists, finding that LLMs can provide comparable but significantly faster estimates. Finally, we perform a real-world risk assessment by simulating the effect of carbohydrate predictions on the blood glucose levels of individuals with diabetes. Our work highlights the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs for nutrition estimation, demonstrating their potential to aid professionals and laypersons and improve health outcomes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet their inference processes are hindered by substantial time and energy demands due to single-token generation at each decoding step. While previous methods such as speculative decoding mitigate these inefficiencies by producing multiple tokens per step, each token is still generated by its single-token distribution, thereby enhancing speed without improving effectiveness. In contrast, our work simultaneously enhances inference speed and improves the output effectiveness. We consider multi-token joint decoding (MTJD), which generates multiple tokens from their joint distribution at each iteration, theoretically reducing perplexity and enhancing task performance. However, MTJD suffers from the high cost of sampling from the joint distribution of multiple tokens. Inspired by speculative decoding, we introduce multi-token assisted decoding (MTAD), a novel framework designed to accelerate MTJD. MTAD leverages a smaller auxiliary model to approximate the joint distribution of a larger model, incorporating a verification mechanism that not only ensures the accuracy of this approximation, but also improves the decoding efficiency over conventional speculative decoding. Theoretically, we demonstrate that MTAD closely approximates exact MTJD with bounded error. Empirical evaluations using Llama-2 and OPT models ranging from 13B to 70B parameters across various tasks reveal that MTAD reduces perplexity by 21.2% and improves downstream performance compared to standard single-token sampling. Furthermore, MTAD achieves a 1.42x speed-up and consumes 1.54x less energy than conventional speculative decoding methods. These results highlight MTAD's ability to make multi-token joint decoding both effective and efficient, promoting more sustainable and high-performance deployment of LLMs.

  Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) is crucial for enabling applications of symbolic knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to downstream tasks by projecting knowledge facts into vector spaces. Despite their effectiveness in modeling KG structural information, KRL methods are suffering from the sparseness of KGs. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the Transformer architecture presents promising opportunities for enhancing KRL by incorporating textual information to address information sparsity in KGs. LLM-enhanced KRL methods, including three key approaches, encoder-based methods that leverage detailed contextual information, encoder-decoder-based methods that utilize a unified Seq2Seq model for comprehensive encoding and decoding, and decoder-based methods that utilize extensive knowledge from large corpora, have significantly advanced the effectiveness and generalization of KRL in addressing a wide range of downstream tasks. This work provides a broad overview of downstream tasks while simultaneously identifying emerging research directions in these evolving domains.

  _Zhi Qu, Chenchen Ding, Taro Watanabe_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding representation transfer in multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) can reveal the reason for the zero-shot translation deficiency. In this work, we systematically analyze the representational issue of MNMT models. We first introduce the identity pair, translating a sentence to itself, to address the lack of the base measure in multilingual investigations, as the identity pair can reflect the representation of a language within the model. Then, we demonstrate that the encoder transfers the source language to the representational subspace of the target language instead of the language-agnostic state. Thus, the zero-shot translation deficiency arises because the representation of a translation is entangled with other languages and not transferred to the target language effectively. Based on our findings, we propose two methods: 1) low-rank language-specific embedding at the encoder, and 2) language-specific contrastive learning of the representation at the decoder. The experimental results on Europarl-15, TED-19, and OPUS-100 datasets show that our methods substantially enhance the performance of zero-shot translations without sacrifices in supervised directions by improving language transfer capacity, thereby providing practical evidence to support our conclusions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural language processing (NLP) is utilized in a wide range of fields, where words in text are typically transformed into feature vectors called embeddings. BioConceptVec is a specific example of embeddings tailored for biology, trained on approximately 30 million PubMed abstracts using models such as skip-gram. Generally, word embeddings are known to solve analogy tasks through simple vector arithmetic. For instance, $\mathrm{\textit{king}} - \mathrm{\textit{man}} + \mathrm{\textit{woman}}$ predicts $\mathrm{\textit{queen}}$. In this study, we demonstrate that BioConceptVec embeddings, along with our own embeddings trained on PubMed abstracts, contain information about drug-gene relations and can predict target genes from a given drug through analogy computations. We also show that categorizing drugs and genes using biological pathways improves performance. Furthermore, we illustrate that vectors derived from known relations in the past can predict unknown future relations in datasets divided by year. Despite the simplicity of implementing analogy tasks as vector additions, our approach demonstrated performance comparable to that of large language models such as GPT-4 in predicting drug-gene relations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have used both automatic metrics and human evaluations to assess the simplification abilities of LLMs. However, the suitability of existing evaluation methodologies for LLMs remains in question. First, the suitability of current automatic metrics on LLMs' simplification evaluation is still uncertain. Second, current human evaluation approaches in sentence simplification often fall into two extremes: they are either too superficial, failing to offer a clear understanding of the models' performance, or overly detailed, making the annotation process complex and prone to inconsistency, which in turn affects the evaluation's reliability. To address these problems, this study provides in-depth insights into LLMs' performance while ensuring the reliability of the evaluation. We design an error-based human annotation framework to assess the LLMs' simplification capabilities. We select both closed-source and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama-3.2-3B. We believe that these models offer a representative selection across large, medium, and small sizes of LLMs. Results show that GPT-4 generally generates fewer erroneous simplification outputs compared to the current state-of-the-art. However, LLMs have their limitations, as seen in GPT-4's struggles with lexical paraphrasing. Results show that LLMs generally generate fewer erroneous simplification outputs compared to the previous state-of-the-art. However, LLMs have their limitations, as seen in GPT-4's and Qwen2.5-72B's struggle with lexical paraphrasing. Furthermore, we conduct meta-evaluations on widely used automatic metrics using our human annotations. We find that these metrics lack sufficient sensitivity to assess the overall high-quality simplifications, particularly those generated by high-performance LLMs.

  This study investigates the ability of GPT models (ChatGPT, GPT-4 and GPT-4o) to generate dialogue summaries that adhere to human guidelines. Our evaluation involved experimenting with various prompts to guide the models in complying with guidelines on two datasets: DialogSum (English social conversations) and DECODA (French call center interactions). Human evaluation, based on summarization guidelines, served as the primary assessment method, complemented by extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our findings reveal a preference for GPT-generated summaries over those from task-specific pre-trained models and reference summaries, highlighting GPT models' ability to follow human guidelines despite occasionally producing longer outputs and exhibiting divergent lexical and structural alignment with references. The discrepancy between ROUGE, BERTScore, and human evaluation underscores the need for more reliable automatic evaluation metrics.

  We address the task of 3D reconstruction in dynamic scenes, where object motions degrade the quality of previous 3D pointmap regression methods, such as DUSt3R, originally designed for static 3D scene reconstruction. Although these methods provide an elegant and powerful solution in static settings, they struggle in the presence of dynamic motions that disrupt alignment based solely on camera poses. To overcome this, we propose D^2USt3R that regresses 4D pointmaps that simultaneiously capture both static and dynamic 3D scene geometry in a feed-forward manner. By explicitly incorporating both spatial and temporal aspects, our approach successfully encapsulates spatio-temporal dense correspondence to the proposed 4D pointmaps, enhancing downstream tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently achieves superior reconstruction performance across various datasets featuring complex motions.

  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an important image format widely adopted in graphic design because of their resolution independence and editability. The study of generating high-quality SVG has continuously drawn attention from both designers and researchers in the AIGC community. However, existing methods either produces unstructured outputs with huge computational cost or is limited to generating monochrome icons of over-simplified structures. To produce high-quality and complex SVG, we propose OmniSVG, a unified framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for end-to-end multimodal SVG generation. By parameterizing SVG commands and coordinates into discrete tokens, OmniSVG decouples structural logic from low-level geometry for efficient training while maintaining the expressiveness of complex SVG structure. To further advance the development of SVG synthesis, we introduce MMSVG-2M, a multimodal dataset with two million richly annotated SVG assets, along with a standardized evaluation protocol for conditional SVG generation tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG outperforms existing methods and demonstrates its potential for integration into professional SVG design workflows.

  Despite the span in estimating pain from facial expressions, limited works have focused on estimating the sequence-level pain, which is reported by patients and used commonly in clinics. In this paper, we introduce a novel Statistical Relation Network, referred to as PainNet, designed for the estimation of the sequence-level pain. PainNet employs two key modules, the embedding and the relation modules, for comparing pairs of pain videos, and producing relation scores indicating if each pair belongs to the same pain category or not. At the core of the embedding module is a statistical layer mounted on the top of a RNN for extracting compact video-level features. The statistical layer is implemented as part of the deep architecture. Doing so, allows combining multiple training stages used in previous research, into a single end-to-end training stage. PainNet is trained using the episode-based training scheme, which involves comparing a query video with a set of videos representing the different pain categories. Experimental results show the benefit of using the statistical layer and the episode-based training in the proposed model. Furthermore, PainNet outperforms the state-of-the-art results on self-reported pain estimation.

  Unified multimodal models aim to integrate understanding (text output) and generation (pixel output), but aligning these different modalities within a single architecture often demands complex training recipes and careful data balancing. We introduce MetaQueries, a set of learnable queries that act as an efficient interface between autoregressive multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models. MetaQueries connects the MLLM's latents to the diffusion decoder, enabling knowledge-augmented image generation by leveraging the MLLM's deep understanding and reasoning capabilities. Our method simplifies training, requiring only paired image-caption data and standard diffusion objectives. Notably, this transfer is effective even when the MLLM backbone remains frozen, thereby preserving its state-of-the-art multimodal understanding capabilities while achieving strong generative performance. Additionally, our method is flexible and can be easily instruction-tuned for advanced applications such as image editing and subject-driven generation.

  Nowadays, video ads spread through numerous online platforms, and are being watched by millions of viewers worldwide. Big brands gauge the liking and purchase intent of their new ads, by analyzing the facial responses of viewers recruited online to watch the ads from home or work. Although this approach captures naturalistic responses, it is susceptible to distractions inherent in the participants' environments, such as a movie playing on TV, a colleague speaking, or mobile notifications. Inattentive participants should get flagged and eliminated to avoid skewing the ad-testing process. In this paper we introduce an architecture for monitoring viewer attention during online ads. Leveraging two behavior analysis toolkits; AFFDEX 2.0 and SmartEye SDK, we extract low-level facial features encompassing facial expressions, head pose, and gaze direction. These features are then combined to extract high-level features that include estimated gaze on the screen plane, yawning, speaking, etc -- this enables the identification of four primary distractors; off-screen gaze, drowsiness, speaking, and unattended screen. Our architecture tailors the gaze settings according to the device type (desktop or mobile). We validate our architecture first on datasets annotated for specific distractors, and then on a real-world ad testing dataset with various distractors. The proposed architecture shows promising results in detecting distraction across both desktop and mobile devices.

  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion/flow models have drawn considerable attention recently due to their remarkable ability to deliver flexible visual creations. Still, high-resolution image synthesis presents formidable challenges due to the scarcity and complexity of high-resolution content. To this end, we present HiFlow, a training-free and model-agnostic framework to unlock the resolution potential of pre-trained flow models. Specifically, HiFlow establishes a virtual reference flow within the high-resolution space that effectively captures the characteristics of low-resolution flow information, offering guidance for high-resolution generation through three key aspects: initialization alignment for low-frequency consistency, direction alignment for structure preservation, and acceleration alignment for detail fidelity. By leveraging this flow-aligned guidance, HiFlow substantially elevates the quality of high-resolution image synthesis of T2I models and demonstrates versatility across their personalized variants. Extensive experiments validate HiFlow's superiority in achieving superior high-resolution image quality over current state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a technique that allows us to adapt powerful Foundation Models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks while preserving and unleashing their inherent capabilities. However, we have observed that existing PEFT methods, which are often designed with natural imagery in mind, struggle when applied to Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios. This is primarily due to their inability to handle artifact influences, a problem particularly severe in RS image features. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Earth-Adapter, the first PEFT method specifically designed for RS artifacts conquering. Earth-Adapter introduces a novel Mixture of Frequency Adaptation process that combines a Mixture of Adapter (MoA) with Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT). By utilizing DFT, Earth-Adapter can decompose features into different frequency components, precisely separating artifacts from original features. The MoA then dynamically assigns weights to each adapter expert, allowing for the combination of features across various frequency domains. These simple-yet-effective approaches enable Earth-Adapter to more efficiently overcome the disturbances caused by artifacts than previous PEFT methods, significantly enhancing the FMs' performance on RS scenarios. Experiments on Domain Adaptation (DA), and Domain Generalization (DG) semantic segmentation benchmarks showcase the Earth-Adapter's effectiveness. Compared with baseline Rein, Earth-Adapter significantly improves 9.0% mIoU in DA and 3.1% mIoU in DG benchmarks. Our code will be released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Hierarchical Motion Representation (HiMoR), a novel deformation representation for 3D Gaussian primitives capable of achieving high-quality monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction. The insight behind HiMoR is that motions in everyday scenes can be decomposed into coarser motions that serve as the foundation for finer details. Using a tree structure, HiMoR's nodes represent different levels of motion detail, with shallower nodes modeling coarse motion for temporal smoothness and deeper nodes capturing finer motion. Additionally, our model uses a few shared motion bases to represent motions of different sets of nodes, aligning with the assumption that motion tends to be smooth and simple. This motion representation design provides Gaussians with a more structured deformation, maximizing the use of temporal relationships to tackle the challenging task of monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction. We also propose using a more reliable perceptual metric as an alternative, given that pixel-level metrics for evaluating monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction can sometimes fail to accurately reflect the true quality of reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's efficacy in achieving superior novel view synthesis from challenging monocular videos with complex motions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-resolution segmentation is critical for precise disease diagnosis by extracting micro-imaging information from medical images. Existing transformer-based encoder-decoder frameworks have demonstrated remarkable versatility and zero-shot performance in medical segmentation. While beneficial, they usually require huge memory costs when handling large-size segmentation mask predictions, which are expensive to apply to real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a memory-efficient framework for high-resolution medical image segmentation, called HRMedSeg. Specifically, we first devise a lightweight gated vision transformer (LGViT) as our image encoder to model long-range dependencies with linear complexity. Then, we design an efficient cross-multiscale decoder (ECM-Decoder) to generate high-resolution segmentation masks. Moreover, we utilize feature distillation during pretraining to unleash the potential of our proposed model. Extensive experiments reveal that HRMedSeg outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse high-resolution medical image segmentation tasks. In particular, HRMedSeg uses only 0.59GB GPU memory per batch during fine-tuning, demonstrating low training costs. Besides, when HRMedSeg meets the Segment Anything Model (SAM), our HRMedSegSAM takes 0.61% parameters of SAM-H. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Chronic wounds affect a large population, particularly the elderly and diabetic patients, who often exhibit limited mobility and co-existing health conditions. Automated wound monitoring via mobile image capture can reduce in-person physician visits by enabling remote tracking of wound size. Semantic segmentation is key to this process, yet wound segmentation remains underrepresented in medical imaging research. To address this, we benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models from general-purpose vision, medical imaging, and top methods from public wound challenges. For fair comparison, we standardize training, data augmentation, and evaluation, conducting cross-validationto minimize partitioning bias. We also assess real-world deployment aspects, including generalization to an out-of-distribution wound dataset, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a reference object-based approach to convert AI-generated masks into clinically relevant wound size estimates, and evaluate this, along with mask quality, for the best models based on physician assessments. Overall, the transformer-based TransNeXt showed the highest levels of generalizability. Despite variations in inference times, all models processed at least one image per second on the CPU, which is deemed adequate for the intended application. Interpretability analysis typically revealed prominent activations in wound regions, emphasizing focus on clinically relevant features. Expert evaluation showed high mask approval for all analyzed models, with VWFormer and ConvNeXtS backbone performing the best. Size retrieval accuracy was similar across models, and predictions closely matched expert annotations. Finally, we demonstrate how our AI-driven wound size estimation framework, WoundAmbit, can be integrated into a custom telehealth system. Our code will be made available on GitHub upon publication.

  Existing text-to-3D and image-to-3D models often struggle with complex scenes involving multiple objects and intricate interactions. Although some recent attempts have explored such compositional scenarios, they still require an extensive process of optimizing the entire layout, which is highly cumbersome if not infeasible at all. To overcome these challenges, we propose Flash Sculptor in this paper, a simple yet effective framework for compositional 3D scene/object reconstruction from a single image. At the heart of Flash Sculptor lies a divide-and-conquer strategy, which decouples compositional scene reconstruction into a sequence of sub-tasks, including handling the appearance, rotation, scale, and translation of each individual instance. Specifically, for rotation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine scheme that brings the best of both worlds--efficiency and accuracy--while for translation, we develop an outlier-removal-based algorithm that ensures robust and precise parameters in a single step, without any iterative optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Flash Sculptor achieves at least a 3 times speedup over existing compositional 3D methods, while setting new benchmarks in compositional 3D reconstruction performance.

In this survey, we introduce a taxonomy with nine dimensions related to the AV task, encompassing data, methodological approaches, evaluation techniques, and practical applications. Through this analysis, we aim to identify the essential characteristics of effective AV methods, highlight existing gaps in research, and propose future directions for advancing the field.

  _Saad Wazir, Daeyoung Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identifying biomarkers in medical images is vital for a wide range of biotech applications. However, recent Transformer and CNN based methods often struggle with variations in morphology and staining, which limits their feature extraction capabilities. In medical image segmentation, where data samples are often limited, state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods improve accuracy by using pre-trained encoders, while end-to-end approaches typically fall short due to difficulties in transferring multiscale features effectively between encoders and decoders. To handle these challenges, we introduce a nested UNet architecture that captures both local and global context through Multiscale Feature Fusion and Attention Mechanisms. This design improves feature integration from encoders, highlights key channels and regions, and restores spatial details to enhance segmentation performance. Our method surpasses SOTA approaches, as evidenced by experiments across four datasets and detailed ablation studies. Code:this https URL

  Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for label-free model pretraining, particularly in the video domain, where manual annotation is costly and time-intensive. However, existing self-supervised approaches employ diverse experimental setups, making direct comparisons challenging due to the absence of a standardized benchmark. In this work, we establish a unified benchmark that enables fair comparisons across different methods. Additionally, we systematically investigate five critical aspects of self-supervised learning in videos: (1) dataset size, (2) model complexity, (3) data distribution, (4) data noise, and (5) feature representations. To facilitate this study, we evaluate six self-supervised learning methods across six network architectures, conducting extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets and assessing performance on two distinct downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals key insights into the interplay between pretraining strategies, dataset characteristics, pretext tasks, and model architectures. Furthermore, we extend these findings to Video Foundation Models (ViFMs), demonstrating their relevance in large-scale video representation learning. Finally, leveraging these insights, we propose a novel approach that significantly reduces training data requirements while surpassing state-of-the-art methods that rely on 10% more pretraining data. We believe this work will guide future research toward a deeper understanding of self-supervised video representation learning and its broader implications.

  _Xiangxi Zheng, Linjie Li, Zhengyuan Yang, Ping Yu, Alex Jinpeng Wang, Rui Yan, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have led to significant improvements across various multimodal benchmarks. However, as evaluations shift from static datasets to open-world, dynamic environments, current game-based benchmarks remain inadequate because they lack visual-centric tasks and fail to assess the diverse reasoning skills required for real-world decision-making. To address this, we introduce Visual-centric Multiple Abilities Game Evaluation (V-MAGE), a game-based evaluation framework designed to assess visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. V-MAGE features five diverse games with 30+ handcrafted levels, testing models on core visual skills such as positioning, trajectory tracking, timing, and visual memory, alongside higher-level reasoning like long-term planning and deliberation. We use V-MAGE to evaluate leading MLLMs, revealing significant challenges in their visual perception and reasoning. In all game environments, the top-performing MLLMs, as determined by Elo rating comparisons, exhibit a substantial performance gap compared to humans. Our findings highlight critical limitations, including various types of perceptual errors made by the models, and suggest potential avenues for improvement from an agent-centric perspective, such as refining agent strategies and addressing perceptual inaccuracies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a training-free style-aligned image generation method that leverages a scale-wise autoregressive model. While large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models, particularly diffusion-based methods, have demonstrated impressive generation quality, they often suffer from style misalignment across generated image sets and slow inference speeds, limiting their practical usability. To address these issues, we propose three key components: initial feature replacement to ensure consistent background appearance, pivotal feature interpolation to align object placement, and dynamic style injection, which reinforces style consistency using a schedule function. Unlike previous methods requiring fine-tuning or additional training, our approach maintains fast inference while preserving individual content details. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves generation quality comparable to competing approaches, significantly improves style alignment, and delivers inference speeds over six times faster than the fastest model.

  Generative models can reconstruct face images from encoded representations (templates) bearing remarkable likeness to the original face raising security and privacy concerns. We present FaceCloak, a neural network framework that protects face templates by generating smart, renewable binary cloaks. Our method proactively thwarts inversion attacks by cloaking face templates with unique disruptors synthesized from a single face template on the fly while provably retaining biometric utility and unlinkability. Our cloaked templates can suppress sensitive attributes while generalizing to novel feature extraction schemes and outperforms leading baselines in terms of biometric matching and resiliency to reconstruction attacks. FaceCloak-based matching is extremely fast (inference time cost=0.28ms) and light-weight (0.57MB).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing lane detection algorithms generally perform well under favorable weather conditions. However, their performance degrades significantly in adverse conditions, such as fog, which increases the risk of traffic accidents. This challenge is compounded by the lack of specialized datasets and methods designed for foggy environments. To address this, we introduce the FoggyLane dataset, captured in real-world foggy scenarios, and synthesize two additional datasets, FoggyCULane and FoggyTusimple, from existing popular lane detection datasets. Furthermore, we propose a robust Fog-Enhanced Network for lane detection, incorporating a Global Feature Fusion Module (GFFM) to capture global relationships in foggy images, a Kernel Feature Fusion Module (KFFM) to model the structural and positional relationships of lane instances, and a Low-level Edge Enhanced Module (LEEM) to address missing edge details in foggy conditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 95.04 on FoggyLane, 79.85 on FoggyCULane, and 96.95 on FoggyTusimple. Additionally, with TensorRT acceleration, the method reaches a processing speed of 38.4 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, confirming its real-time capabilities and robustness in foggy environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an intriguing open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention. Given a dataset that includes both labelled and unlabelled images, GCD aims to categorize all images in the unlabelled subset, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. In GCD, the common practice typically involves applying a spherical projection operator at the end of the self-supervised pretrained backbone, operating within Euclidean or spherical space. However, both of these spaces have been shown to be suboptimal for encoding samples that possesses hierarchical structures. In contrast, hyperbolic space exhibits exponential volume growth relative to radius, making it inherently strong at capturing the hierarchical structure of samples from both seen and unseen categories. Therefore, we propose to tackle the category discovery challenge in the hyperbolic space. We introduce HypCD, a simple \underline{Hyp}erbolic framework for learning hierarchy-aware representations and classifiers for generalized \underline{C}ategory \underline{D}iscovery. HypCD first transforms the Euclidean embedding space of the backbone network into hyperbolic space, facilitating subsequent representation and classification learning by considering both hyperbolic distance and the angle between samples. This approach is particularly helpful for knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories in GCD. We thoroughly evaluate HypCD on public GCD benchmarks, by applying it to various baseline and state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving significant improvements.

  Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a critical task in computer vision, traditionally enhanced by re-ranking retrieval results with image matching. However, recent advancements in VPR methods have significantly improved performance, challenging the necessity of re-ranking. In this work, we show that modern retrieval systems often reach a point where re-ranking can degrade results, as current VPR datasets are largely saturated. We propose using image matching as a verification step to assess retrieval confidence, demonstrating that inlier counts can reliably predict when re-ranking is beneficial. Our findings shift the paradigm of retrieval pipelines, offering insights for more robust and adaptive VPR systems.

  _Divyanshu Mishra, Pramit Saha, He Zhao, Netzahualcoyotl Hernandez-Cruz, Olga Patey, Aris Papageorghiou, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate standard plane acquisition in fetal ultrasound (US) videos is crucial for fetal growth assessment, anomaly detection, and adherence to clinical guidelines. However, manually selecting standard frames is time-consuming and prone to intra- and inter-sonographer variability. Existing methods primarily rely on image-based approaches that capture standard frames and then classify the input frames across different anatomies. This ignores the dynamic nature of video acquisition and its interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Tier Class-Aware Token Transformer (MCAT), a visual query-based video clip localization (VQ-VCL) method, to assist sonographers by enabling them to capture a quick US sweep. By then providing a visual query of the anatomy they wish to analyze, MCAT returns the video clip containing the standard frames for that anatomy, facilitating thorough screening for potential anomalies. We evaluate MCAT on two ultrasound video datasets and a natural image VQ-VCL dataset based on Ego4D. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% and 13% mIoU on the ultrasound datasets and by 5.35% mIoU on the Ego4D dataset, using 96% fewer tokens. MCAT's efficiency and accuracy have significant potential implications for public health, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where it may enhance prenatal care by streamlining standard plane acquisition, simplifying US-based screening, diagnosis and allowing sonographers to examine more patients.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Capsule endoscopy is a method to capture images of the gastrointestinal tract and screen for diseases which might remain hidden if investigated with standard endoscopes. Due to the limited size of a video capsule, embedding AI models directly into the capsule demands careful consideration of the model size and thus complicates anomaly detection in this field. Furthermore, the scarcity of available data in this domain poses an ongoing challenge to achieving effective anomaly detection. Thus, this work introduces an ensemble strategy to address this challenge in anomaly detection tasks in video capsule endoscopies, requiring only a small number of individual neural networks during both the training and inference phases. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of multiple independently trained neural networks. This has shown to be highly effective in enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models. However, this comes at the cost of higher memory usage and increased computational effort, which quickly becomes prohibitive in many real-world applications. Instead of applying the same training algorithm to each individual network, we propose using various loss functions, drawn from the anomaly detection field, to train each network. The methods are validated on the two largest publicly available datasets for video capsule endoscopy images, the Galar and the Kvasir-Capsule dataset. We achieve an AUC score of 76.86% on the Kvasir-Capsule and an AUC score of 76.98% on the Galar dataset. Our approach outperforms current baselines with significantly fewer parameters across all models, which is a crucial step towards incorporating artificial intelligence into capsule endoscopies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive scene understanding and generative quality, incorporating image conditions to guide generation. However, these models primarily animate static images without extending beyond their provided context. Introducing additional constraints, such as camera trajectories, can enhance diversity but often degrades visual quality, limiting their applicability for tasks requiring faithful scene representation. We propose CamContextI2V, an I2V model that integrates multiple image conditions with 3D constraints alongside camera control to enrich both global semantics and fine-grained visual details. This enables more coherent and context-aware video generation. Moreover, we motivate the necessity of temporal awareness for an effective context representation. Our comprehensive study on the RealEstate10K dataset demonstrates improvements in visual quality and camera controllability. We make our code and models publicly available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel memory-modular learner for image classification that separates knowledge memorization from reasoning. Our model enables effective generalization to new classes by simply replacing the memory contents, without the need for model retraining. Unlike traditional models that encode both world knowledge and task-specific skills into their weights during training, our model stores knowledge in the external memory of web-crawled image and text data. At inference time, the model dynamically selects relevant content from the memory based on the input image, allowing it to adapt to arbitrary classes by simply replacing the memory contents. The key differentiator that our learner meta-learns to perform classification tasks with noisy web data from unseen classes, resulting in robust performance across various classification scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance and versatility of our approach in handling diverse classification tasks, including zero-shot/few-shot classification of unseen classes, fine-grained classification, and class-incremental classification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose the FedFeat+ framework, which distinctively separates feature extraction from classification. We develop a two-tiered model training process: following local training, clients transmit their weights and some features extracted from the feature extractor from the final local epochs to the server. The server aggregates these models using the FedAvg method and subsequently retrains the global classifier utilizing the shared features. The classifier retraining process enhances the model's understanding of the holistic view of the data distribution, ensuring better generalization across diverse datasets. This improved generalization enables the classifier to adaptively influence the feature extractor during subsequent local training epochs. We establish a balance between enhancing model accuracy and safeguarding individual privacy through the implementation of differential privacy mechanisms. By incorporating noise into the feature vectors shared with the server, we ensure that sensitive data remains confidential. We present a comprehensive convergence analysis, along with theoretical reasoning regarding performance enhancement and privacy preservation. We validate our approach through empirical evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and FMNIST, achieving high accuracy while adhering to stringent privacy guarantees. The experimental results demonstrate that the FedFeat+ framework, despite using only a lightweight two-layer CNN classifier, outperforms the FedAvg method in both IID and non-IID scenarios, achieving accuracy improvements ranging from 3.92 % to 12.34 % across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The primary focus of most recent works on open-vocabulary neural fields is extracting precise semantic features from the VLMs and then consolidating them efficiently into a multi-view consistent 3D neural fields representation. However, most existing works over-trusted SAM to regularize image-level CLIP without any further refinement. Moreover, several existing works improved efficiency by dimensionality reduction of semantic features from 2D VLMs before fusing with 3DGS semantic fields, which inevitably leads to multi-view inconsistency. In this work, we propose econSG for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with 3DGS. Our econSG consists of: 1) A Confidence-region Guided Regularization (CRR) that mutually refines SAM and CLIP to get the best of both worlds for precise semantic features with complete and precise boundaries. 2) A low dimensional contextual space to enforce 3D multi-view consistency while improving computational efficiency by fusing backprojected multi-view 2D features and follow by dimensional reduction directly on the fused 3D features instead of operating on each 2D view separately. Our econSG shows state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, we are also the most efficient training among all the methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancement of sensing technology has driven the widespread application of high-dimensional data. However, issues such as missing entries during acquisition and transmission negatively impact the accuracy of subsequent tasks. Tensor reconstruction aims to recover the underlying complete data from under-sampled observed data by exploring prior information in high-dimensional data. However, due to insufficient exploration, reconstruction methods still face challenges when sampling rate is extremely low. This work proposes a tensor reconstruction method integrating multiple priors to comprehensively exploit the inherent structure of the data. Specifically, the method combines learnable tensor decomposition to enforce low-rank constraints of the reconstructed data, a pre-trained convolutional neural network for smoothing and denoising, and block-matching and 3D filtering regularization to enhance the non-local similarity in the reconstructed data. An alternating direction method of the multipliers algorithm is designed to decompose the resulting optimization problem into three subproblems for efficient resolution. Extensive experiments on color images, hyperspectral images, and grayscale videos datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in extreme cases as compared with state-of-the-art methods.

  The landscape of image generation has rapidly evolved, from early GAN-based approaches to diffusion models and, most recently, to unified generative architectures that seek to bridge understanding and generation tasks. Recent advances, especially the GPT-4o, have demonstrated the feasibility of high-fidelity multimodal generation, their architectural design remains mysterious and unpublished. This prompts the question of whether image and text generation have already been successfully integrated into a unified framework for those methods. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of GPT-4o's image generation capabilities, benchmarking it against leading open-source and commercial models. Our evaluation covers four main categories, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-3D, and image-to-X generation, with more than 20 tasks. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of GPT-4o under various settings, and situates it within the broader evolution of generative modeling. Through this investigation, we identify promising directions for future unified generative models, emphasizing the role of architectural design and data scaling.

  Medical image segmentation often involves inherent uncertainty due to variations in expert annotations. Capturing this uncertainty is an important goal and previous works have used various generative image models for the purpose of representing the full distribution of plausible expert ground truths. In this work, we explore the design space of diffusion models for generative segmentation, investigating the impact of noise schedules, prediction types, and loss weightings. Notably, we find that making the noise schedule harder with input scaling significantly improves performance. We conclude that x- and v-prediction outperform epsilon-prediction, likely because the diffusion process is in the discrete segmentation domain. Many loss weightings achieve similar performance as long as they give enough weight to the end of the diffusion process. We base our experiments on the LIDC-IDRI lung lesion dataset and obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, we introduce a randomly cropped variant of the LIDC-IDRI dataset that is better suited for uncertainty in image segmentation. Our model also achieves SOTA in this harder setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic view positioning is crucial for cardiac computed tomography (CT) examinations, including disease diagnosis and surgical planning. However, it is highly challenging due to individual variability and large 3D search space. Existing work needs labor-intensive and time-consuming manual annotations to train view-specific models, which are limited to predicting only a fixed set of planes. However, in real clinical scenarios, the challenge of positioning semantic 2D slices with any orientation into varying coordinate space in arbitrary 3D volume remains unsolved. We thus introduce a novel framework, AVP-AP, the first to use Atlas Prompting for self-supervised Automatic View Positioning in the 3D CT volume. Specifically, this paper first proposes an atlas prompting method, which generates a 3D canonical atlas and trains a network to map slices into their corresponding positions in the atlas space via a self-supervised manner. Then, guided by atlas prompts corresponding to the given query images in a reference CT, we identify the coarse positions of slices in the target CT volume using rigid transformation between the 3D atlas and target CT volume, effectively reducing the search space. Finally, we refine the coarse positions by maximizing the similarity between the predicted slices and the query images in the feature space of a given foundation model. Our framework is flexible and efficient compared to other methods, outperforming other methods by 19.8% average structural similarity (SSIM) in arbitrary view positioning and achieving 9% SSIM in two-chamber view compared to four radiologists. Meanwhile, experiments on a public dataset validate our framework's generalizability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-Shot Action Recognition (FSAR) aims to train a model with only a few labeled video instances. A key challenge in FSAR is handling divergent narrative trajectories for precise video matching. While the frame- and tuple-level alignment approaches have been promising, their methods heavily rely on pre-defined and length-dependent alignment units (e.g., frames or tuples), which limits flexibility for actions of varying lengths and speeds. In this work, we introduce a novel TEmporal Alignment-free Matching (TEAM) approach, which eliminates the need for temporal units in action representation and brute-force alignment during matching. Specifically, TEAM represents each video with a fixed set of pattern tokens that capture globally discriminative clues within the video instance regardless of action length or speed, ensuring its flexibility. Furthermore, TEAM is inherently efficient, using token-wise comparisons to measure similarity between videos, unlike existing methods that rely on pairwise comparisons for temporal alignment. Additionally, we propose an adaptation process that identifies and removes common information across classes, establishing clear boundaries even between novel categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TEAM. Codes are available atthis http URL.

  Vision-language temporal alignment is a crucial capability for human dynamic recognition and cognition in real-world scenarios. While existing research focuses on capturing vision-language relevance, it faces limitations due to biased temporal distributions, imprecise annotations, and insufficient compositionally. To achieve fair evaluation and comprehensive exploration, our objective is to investigate and evaluate the ability of models to achieve alignment from a temporal perspective, specifically focusing on their capacity to synchronize visual scenarios with linguistic context in a temporally coherent manner. As a preliminary step, we present the statistical analysis of existing benchmarks and reveal the existing challenges from a decomposed perspective. To this end, we introduce SVLTA, the Synthetic Vision-Language Temporal Alignment derived via a well-designed and feasible control generation method within a simulation environment. The approach considers commonsense knowledge, manipulable action, and constrained filtering, which generates reasonable, diverse, and balanced data distributions for diagnostic evaluations. Our experiments reveal diagnostic insights through the evaluations in temporal question answering, distributional shift sensitiveness, and temporal alignment adaptation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The role of long- and short-term dynamics towards salient object detection in videos is under-researched. We present a Transformer-based approach to learn a joint representation of video frames and past saliency information. Our model embeds long- and short-term information to detect dynamically shifting saliency in video. We provide our model with a stream of video frames and past saliency maps, which acts as a prior for the next prediction, and extract spatiotemporal tokens from both modalities. The decomposition of the frame sequence into tokens lets the model incorporate short-term information from within the token, while being able to make long-term connections between tokens throughout the sequence. The core of the system consists of a dual-stream Transformer architecture to process the extracted sequences independently before fusing the two modalities. Additionally, we apply a saliency-based masking scheme to the input frames to learn an embedding that facilitates the recognition of deviations from previous outputs. We observe that the additional prior information aids in the first detection of the salient location. Our findings indicate that the ratio of spatiotemporal long- and short-term features directly impacts the model's performance. While increasing the short-term context is beneficial up to a certain threshold, the model's performance greatly benefits from an expansion of the long-term context.

  Driving scene understanding is a critical real-world problem that involves interpreting and associating various elements of a driving environment, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals. Despite advancements in autonomous driving, traditional pipelines rely on deterministic models that fail to capture the probabilistic nature and inherent uncertainty of real-world driving. To address this, we propose PRIMEDrive-CoT, a novel uncertainty-aware model for object interaction and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in driving scenarios. In particular, our approach combines LiDAR-based 3D object detection with multi-view RGB references to ensure interpretable and reliable scene understanding. Uncertainty and risk assessment, along with object interactions, are modelled using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguous conditions. Interpretable decisions are facilitated through CoT reasoning, leveraging object dynamics and contextual cues, while Grad-CAM visualizations highlight attention regions. Extensive evaluations on the DriveCoT dataset demonstrate that PRIMEDrive-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art CoT and risk-aware models.

  Recent unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) methods predominantly adopt the motion-appearance paradigm. Mainstream motion-appearance approaches use either the two-encoder structure to separately encode motion and appearance features, or the single-encoder structure for joint encoding. However, these methods fail to properly balance the motion-appearance relationship. Consequently, even with complex fusion modules for motion-appearance integration, the extracted suboptimal features degrade the models' overall performance. Moreover, the quality of optical flow varies across scenarios, making it insufficient to rely solely on optical flow to achieve high-quality segmentation results. To address these challenges, we propose the Intrinsic Saliency guided Trunk-Collateral Net}work (ISTC-Net), which better balances the motion-appearance relationship and incorporates model's intrinsic saliency information to enhance segmentation performance. Specifically, considering that optical flow maps are derived from RGB images, they share both commonalities and differences. We propose a novel Trunk-Collateral structure. The shared trunk backbone captures the motion-appearance commonality, while the collateral branch learns the uniqueness of motion features. Furthermore, an Intrinsic Saliency guided Refinement Module (ISRM) is devised to efficiently leverage the model's intrinsic saliency information to refine high-level features, and provide pixel-level guidance for motion-appearance fusion, thereby enhancing performance without additional input. Experimental results show that ISTC-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance on three UVOS datasets (89.2% J&F on DAVIS-16, 76% J on YouTube-Objects, 86.4% J on FBMS) and four standard video salient object detection (VSOD) benchmarks with the notable increase, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over previous methods.

  3D semantic segmentation plays a critical role in urban modelling, enabling detailed understanding and mapping of city environments. In this paper, we introduce Turin3D: a new aerial LiDAR dataset for point cloud semantic segmentation covering an area of around 1.43 km2 in the city centre of Turin with almost 70M points. We describe the data collection process and compare Turin3D with others previously proposed in the literature. We did not fully annotate the dataset due to the complexity and time-consuming nature of the process; however, a manual annotation process was performed on the validation and test sets, to enable a reliable evaluation of the proposed techniques. We first benchmark the performances of several point cloud semantic segmentation models, trained on the existing datasets, when tested on Turin3D, and then improve their performances by applying a semi-supervised learning technique leveraging the unlabelled training set. The dataset will be publicly available to support research in outdoor point cloud segmentation, with particular relevance for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches given the absence of ground truth annotations for the training set.

  Latent diffusion models can be used as a powerful augmentation method to artificially extend datasets for enhanced training. To the human eye, these augmented images look very different to the originals. Previous work has suggested to use this data augmentation technique for data anonymization. However, we show that latent diffusion models that are conditioned on features like depth maps or edges to guide the diffusion process are not suitable as a privacy preserving method. We use a contrastive learning approach to train a model that can correctly identify people out of a pool of candidates. Moreover, we demonstrate that anonymization using conditioned diffusion models is susceptible to black box attacks. We attribute the success of the described methods to the conditioning of the latent diffusion model in the anonymization process. The diffusion model is instructed to produce similar edges for the anonymized images. Hence, a model can learn to recognize these patterns for identification.

  Human Activity Recognition (HAR) primarily relied on traditional RGB cameras to achieve high-performance activity recognition. However, the challenging factors in real-world scenarios, such as insufficient lighting and rapid movements, inevitably degrade the performance of RGB cameras. To address these challenges, biologically inspired event cameras offer a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional RGB cameras. In this work, we rethink human activity recognition by combining the RGB and event cameras. The first contribution is the proposed large-scale multi-modal RGB-Event human activity recognition benchmark dataset, termed HARDVS 2.0, which bridges the dataset gaps. It contains 300 categories of everyday real-world actions with a total of 107,646 paired videos covering various challenging scenarios. Inspired by the physics-informed heat conduction model, we propose a novel multi-modal heat conduction operation framework for effective activity recognition, termed MMHCO-HAR. More in detail, given the RGB frames and event streams, we first extract the feature embeddings using a stem network. Then, multi-modal Heat Conduction blocks are designed to fuse the dual features, the key module of which is the multi-modal Heat Conduction Operation layer. We integrate RGB and event embeddings through a multi-modal DCT-IDCT layer while adaptively incorporating the thermal conductivity coefficient via FVEs into this module. After that, we propose an adaptive fusion module based on a policy routing strategy for high-performance classification. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently performs well, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The source code and benchmark dataset will be released onthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) helps reduce hallucinations in Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VLLMs), but its reliance on offline preference data limits adaptability and fails to capture true video-response misalignment. We propose Video Direct Preference Optimization (VDPO), an online preference learning framework that eliminates the need for preference annotation by leveraging video augmentations to generate rejected samples while keeping responses fixed. However, selecting effective augmentations is non-trivial, as some clips may be semantically identical to the original under specific prompts, leading to false rejections and disrupting alignment. To address this, we introduce Prompt-aware Multi-instance Learning VDPO (PaMi-VDPO), which selects augmentations based on prompt context. Instead of a single rejection, we construct a candidate set of augmented clips and apply a close-to-far selection strategy, initially ensuring all clips are semantically relevant while then prioritizing the most prompt-aware distinct clip. This allows the model to better capture meaningful visual differences, mitigating hallucinations, while avoiding false rejections, and improving alignment. PaMi-VDPOseamlessly integrates into existing VLLMs without additional parameters, GPT-4/human supervision. With only 10k SFT data, it improves the base model by 5.3% on VideoHallucer, surpassing GPT-4o, while maintaining stable performance on general video benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sphericity and roundness are fundamental measures used for assessing object uniformity in 2D and 3D images. However, using their strict definition makes computation costly. As both 2D and 3D microscopy imaging datasets grow larger, there is an increased demand for efficient algorithms that can quantify multiple objects in large volumes. We propose a novel approach for extracting sphericity and roundness based on the output of a local thickness algorithm. For sphericity, we simplify the surface area computation by modeling objects as spheroids/ellipses of varying lengths and widths of mean local thickness. For roundness, we avoid a complex corner curvature determination process by approximating it with local thickness values on the contour/surface of the object. The resulting methods provide an accurate representation of the exact measures while being significantly faster than their existing implementations.

  Current image fusion methods struggle to adapt to real-world environments encompassing diverse degradations with spatially varying characteristics. To address this challenge, we propose a robust fusion controller (RFC) capable of achieving degradation-aware image fusion through fine-grained language instructions, ensuring its reliable application in adverse environments. Specifically, RFC first parses language instructions to innovatively derive the functional condition and the spatial condition, where the former specifies the degradation type to remove, while the latter defines its spatial coverage. Then, a composite control priori is generated through a multi-condition coupling network, achieving a seamless transition from abstract language instructions to latent control variables. Subsequently, we design a hybrid attention-based fusion network to aggregate multi-modal information, in which the obtained composite control priori is deeply embedded to linearly modulate the intermediate fused features. To ensure the alignment between language instructions and control outcomes, we introduce a novel language-feature alignment loss, which constrains the consistency between feature-level gains and the composite control priori. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our RFC is robust against various composite degradations, particularly in highly challenging flare scenarios.

  Recently, state space models (SSM), particularly Mamba, have attracted significant attention from scholars due to their ability to effectively balance computational efficiency and performance. However, most existing visual Mamba methods flatten images into 1D sequences using predefined scan orders, which results the model being less capable of utilizing the spatial structural information of the image during the feature extraction process. To address this issue, we proposed a novel visual foundation model called DefMamba. This model includes a multi-scale backbone structure and deformable mamba (DM) blocks, which dynamically adjust the scanning path to prioritize important information, thus enhancing the capture and processing of relevant input features. By combining a deformable scanning(DS) strategy, this model significantly improves its ability to learn image structures and detects changes in object details. Numerous experiments have shown that DefMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in various visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The code is open source on DefMamba.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human pose estimation is a critical tool across a variety of healthcare applications. Despite significant progress in pose estimation algorithms targeting adults, such developments for infants remain limited. Existing algorithms for infant pose estimation, despite achieving commendable performance, depend on fully supervised approaches that require large amounts of labeled data. These algorithms also struggle with poor generalizability under distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce SHIFT: Leveraging SyntHetic Adult Datasets for Unsupervised InFanT Pose Estimation, which leverages the pseudo-labeling-based Mean-Teacher framework to compensate for the lack of labeled data and addresses distribution shifts by enforcing consistency between the student and the teacher pseudo-labels. Additionally, to penalize implausible predictions obtained from the mean-teacher framework, we incorporate an infant manifold pose prior. To enhance SHIFT's self-occlusion perception ability, we propose a novel visibility consistency module for improved alignment of the predicted poses with the original image. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that SHIFT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) pose estimation methods by 5% and supervised infant pose estimation methods by a margin of 16%.

  3D spatial understanding is essential in real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and medical imaging. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), having demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, have been leveraged to enhance 3D understanding tasks, showing potential to surpass traditional computer vision methods. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of methods integrating LLMs with 3D spatial understanding. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three branches: image-based methods deriving 3D understanding from 2D visual data, point cloud-based methods working directly with 3D representations, and hybrid modality-based methods combining multiple data streams. We systematically review representative methods along these categories, covering data representations, architectural modifications, and training strategies that bridge textual and 3D modalities. Finally, we discuss current limitations, including dataset scarcity and computational challenges, while highlighting promising research directions in spatial perception, multi-modal fusion, and real-world applications.

  Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that demands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal dynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in integrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through positional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video sequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a novel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T integrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference (TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for capturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module identifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes within the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these temporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual understanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated through extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results underscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in improving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.

  Multimodal reasoning, which integrates language and visual cues into problem solving and decision making, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and a crucial step toward artificial general intelligence. However, the evaluation of multimodal reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains inadequate. Most existing reasoning benchmarks are constrained by limited data size, narrow domain coverage, and unstructured knowledge distribution. To close these gaps, we introduce MDK12-Bench, a multi-disciplinary benchmark assessing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs via real-world K-12 examinations. Spanning six disciplines (math, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and information science), our benchmark comprises 140K reasoning instances across diverse difficulty levels from primary school to 12th grade. It features 6,827 instance-level knowledge point annotations based on a well-organized knowledge structure, detailed answer explanations, difficulty labels and cross-year partitions, providing a robust platform for comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, we present a novel dynamic evaluation framework to mitigate data contamination issues by bootstrapping question forms, question types, and image styles during evaluation. Extensive experiment on MDK12-Bench reveals the significant limitation of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning. The findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the next-generation models. Our data and codes are available atthis https URL.

  Shadow removal is challenging due to the complex interaction of geometry, lighting, and environmental factors. Existing unsupervised methods often overlook shadow-specific priors, leading to incomplete shadow recovery. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised Frequency Aware Shadow Removal Network (FASR-Net), which leverages the inherent frequency characteristics of shadow regions. Specifically, the proposed Wavelet Attention Downsampling Module (WADM) integrates wavelet-based image decomposition and deformable attention, effectively breaking down the image into frequency components to enhance shadow details within specific frequency bands. We also introduce several new loss functions for precise shadow-free image reproduction: a frequency loss to capture image component details, a brightness-chromaticity loss that references the chromaticity of shadow-free regions, and an alignment loss to ensure smooth transitions between shadowed and shadow-free regions. Experimental results on the AISTD and SRD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior shadow removal performance.

  Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have set new benchmarks in semantic segmentation. However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target domains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention mechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to key objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture, scale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive Cluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images into structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized transferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA) module that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs' attention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low transferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across 20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2% MIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The source code will be publicly available.

SDA-Net incorporates: (1) a Dual Attention Mechanism to enhance stroke-level and spatial feature extraction; (2) a Dynamic Context Encoding module that adaptively refines semantic information using a learnable gating mechanism; (3) a U-Net-inspired Feature Fusion Strategy for combining low-level and high-level features; and (4) a highly optimized lightweight backbone that reduces memory and computational demands.Experimental results show that SDA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging OCR benchmarks, with significantly faster inference, making it well-suited for deployment in real-time and edge-based OCR systems.

  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been widely adopted for reconstructing high quality 3D point clouds from 2D RGB images. However, the segmentation of these reconstructed 3D scenes is more essential for downstream tasks such as object counting, size estimation, and scene understanding. While segmentation on raw 3D point clouds using deep learning requires labor intensive and time-consuming manual annotation, directly training NeRF on binary masks also fails due to the absence of color and shading cues essential for geometry learning. We propose Invariant NeRF for Segmentation (InvNeRFSeg), a two step, zero change fine tuning strategy for 3D segmentation. We first train a standard NeRF on RGB images and then fine tune it using 2D segmentation masks without altering either the model architecture or loss function. This approach produces higher quality, cleaner segmented point clouds directly from the refined radiance field with minimal computational overhead or complexity. Field density analysis reveals consistent semantic refinement: densities of object regions increase while background densities are suppressed, ensuring clean and interpretable segmentations. We demonstrate InvNeRFSegs superior performance over both SA3D and FruitNeRF on both synthetic fruit and real world soybean datasets. This approach effectively extends 2D segmentation to high quality 3D segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The paramount challenge in audio-driven One-shot Talking Head Animation (ADOS-THA) lies in capturing subtle imperceptible changes between adjacent video frames. Inherently, the temporal relationship of adjacent audio clips is highly correlated with that of the corresponding adjacent video frames, offering supplementary information that can be pivotal for guiding and supervising talking head animations. In this work, we propose to learn audio-visual correlations and integrate the correlations to help enhance feature representation and regularize final generation by a novel Temporal Audio-Visual Correlation Embedding (TAVCE) framework. Specifically, it first learns an audio-visual temporal correlation metric, ensuring the temporal audio relationships of adjacent clips are aligned with the temporal visual relationships of corresponding adjacent video frames. Since the temporal audio relationship contains aligned information about the visual frame, we first integrate it to guide learning more representative features via a simple yet effective channel attention mechanism. During training, we also use the alignment correlations as an additional objective to supervise generating visual frames. We conduct extensive experiments on several publicly available benchmarks (i.e., HDTF, LRW, VoxCeleb1, and VoxCeleb2) to demonstrate its superiority over existing leading algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion transformers have demonstrated remarkable generation quality, albeit requiring longer training iterations and numerous inference steps. In each denoising step, diffusion transformers encode the noisy inputs to extract the lower-frequency semantic component and then decode the higher frequency with identical modules. This scheme creates an inherent optimization dilemma: encoding low-frequency semantics necessitates reducing high-frequency components, creating tension between semantic encoding and high-frequency decoding. To resolve this challenge, we propose a new \textbf{\color{ddt}D}ecoupled \textbf{\color{ddt}D}iffusion \textbf{\color{ddt}T}ransformer~(\textbf{\color{ddt}DDT}), with a decoupled design of a dedicated condition encoder for semantic extraction alongside a specialized velocity decoder. Our experiments reveal that a more substantial encoder yields performance improvements as model size increases. For ImageNet $256\times256$, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of {1.31 FID}~(nearly $4\times$ faster training convergence compared to previous diffusion transformers). For ImageNet $512\times512$, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.28. Additionally, as a beneficial by-product, our decoupled architecture enhances inference speed by enabling the sharing self-condition between adjacent denoising steps. To minimize performance degradation, we propose a novel statistical dynamic programming approach to identify optimal sharing strategies.

  Mesh generation plays a crucial role in 3D content creation, as mesh is widely used in various industrial applications. Recent works have achieved impressive results but still face several issues, such as unrealistic patterns or pits on surfaces, thin parts missing, and incomplete structures. Most of these problems stem from the choice of shape representation or the capabilities of the generative network. To alleviate these, we extend PoNQ, a Quadric Error Metrics (QEM)-based representation, and propose a novel model, QEMesh, for high-quality mesh generation. PoNQ divides the shape surface into tiny patches, each represented by a point with its normal and QEM matrix, which preserves fine local geometry information. In our QEMesh, we regard these elements as generable parameters and design a unique latent diffusion model containing a novel multi-decoder VAE for PoNQ parameters generation. Given the latent code generated by the diffusion model, three parameter decoders produce several PoNQ parameters within each voxel cell, and an occupancy decoder predicts which voxel cells containing parameters to form the final shape. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method generates results with watertight surfaces and is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in several main metrics.

  Continued advances in self-supervised learning have led to significant progress in video representation learning, offering a scalable alternative to supervised approaches by removing the need for manual annotations. Despite strong performance on standard action recognition benchmarks, video self-supervised learning methods are largely evaluated under narrow protocols, typically pretraining on Kinetics-400 and fine-tuning on similar datasets, limiting our understanding of their generalization in real world scenarios. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of modern video self-supervised models, focusing on generalization across four key downstream factors: domain shift, sample efficiency, action granularity, and task diversity. Building on our prior work analyzing benchmark sensitivity in CNN-based contrastive learning, we extend the study to cover state-of-the-art transformer-based video-only and video-text models. Specifically, we benchmark 12 transformer-based methods (7 video-only, 5 video-text) and compare them to 10 CNN-based methods, totaling over 1100 experiments across 8 datasets and 7 downstream tasks. Our analysis shows that, despite architectural advances, transformer-based models remain sensitive to downstream conditions. No method generalizes consistently across all factors, video-only transformers perform better under domain shifts, CNNs outperform for fine-grained tasks, and video-text models often underperform despite large scale pretraining. We also find that recent transformer models do not consistently outperform earlier approaches. Our findings provide a detailed view of the strengths and limitations of current video SSL methods and offer a unified benchmark for evaluating generalization in video representation learning.

  Understanding human behavior is an important problem in the pursuit of visual intelligence. A challenge in this endeavor is the extensive and costly effort required to accurately label action segments. To address this issue, we consider learning methods that demand minimal supervision for segmentation of human actions in long instructional videos. Specifically, we introduce a weakly-supervised framework that uniquely incorporates pose knowledge during training while omitting its use during inference, thereby distilling pose knowledge pertinent to each action component. We propose a pose-inspired contrastive loss as a part of the whole weakly-supervised framework which is trained to distinguish action boundaries more effectively. Our approach, validated through extensive experiments on representative datasets, outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) in segmenting long instructional videos under both online and offline settings. Additionally, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability to various segmentation backbones and pose extractors across different datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent point-based object completion methods have demonstrated the ability to accurately recover the missing geometry of partially observed objects. However, these approaches are not well-suited for completing objects within a scene, as they do not consider known scene constraints (e.g., other observed surfaces) in their completions and further expect the partial input to be in a canonical coordinate system, which does not hold for objects within scenes. While instance scene completion methods have been proposed for completing objects within a scene, they lag behind point-based object completion methods in terms of object completion quality and still do not consider known scene constraints during completion. To overcome these limitations, we propose a point cloud-based instance completion model that can robustly complete objects at arbitrary scales and pose in the scene. To enable reasoning at the scene level, we introduce a sparse set of scene constraints represented as point clouds and integrate them into our completion model via a cross-attention mechanism. To evaluate the instance scene completion task on indoor scenes, we further build a new dataset called ScanWCF, which contains labeled partial scans as well as aligned ground truth scene completions that are watertight and collision-free. Through several experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves improved fidelity to partial scans, higher completion quality, and greater plausibility over existing state-of-the-art methods.

  Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is proved to be greatly valuable for enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs. Researchers have been starting to apply RFT to MLLMs, hoping it will also enhance the capabilities of visual understanding. However, these works are at a very early stage and have not examined how suitable RFT actually is for visual tasks. In this work, we endeavor to understand the suitabilities and limitations of RFT for visual tasks, through experimental analysis and observations. We start by quantitative comparisons on various tasks, which shows RFT is generally better than SFT on visual tasks. %especially when the number of training samples are limited. To check whether such advantages are brought up by the reasoning process, we design a new reward that encourages the model to ``think'' more, whose results show more thinking can be beneficial for complicated tasks but harmful for simple tasks. We hope this study can provide more insight for the rapid advancements on this topic.

  Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based visual inspections are a more efficient alternative to manual methods for examining civil structural defects, offering safe access to hazardous areas and significant cost savings by reducing labor requirements. However, traditional frame-based cameras, widely used in UAV-based inspections, often struggle to capture defects under low or dynamic lighting conditions. In contrast, Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), or event-based cameras, excel in such scenarios by minimizing motion blur, enhancing power efficiency, and maintaining high-quality imaging across diverse lighting conditions without saturation or information loss. Despite these advantages, existing research lacks studies exploring the feasibility of using DVS for detecting civil structuralthis http URL, there is no dedicated event-based dataset tailored for this purpose. Addressing this gap, this study introduces the first event-based civil infrastructure defect detection dataset, capturing defective surfaces as a spatio-temporal event stream usingthis http URLaddition to event-based data, the dataset includes grayscale intensity image frames captured simultaneously using an Active Pixel Sensor (APS).

  Neural network ensembles is a simple yet effective approach for enhancing generalization capabilities. The most common method involves independently training multiple neural networks initialized with different weights and then averaging their predictions during inference. However, this approach increases training time linearly with the number of ensemble members. To address this issue, we propose the novel ``\textbf{Noisy Deep Ensemble}'' method, significantly reducing the training time required for neural network ensembles. In this method, a \textit{parent model} is trained until convergence, and then the weights of the \textit{parent model} are perturbed in various ways to construct multiple \textit{child models}. This perturbation of the \textit{parent model} weights facilitates the exploration of different local minima while significantly reducing the training time for each ensemble member. We evaluated our method using diverse CNN architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, surpassing conventional efficient ensemble methods and achieving test accuracy comparable to standard ensembles.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As short videos have risen in popularity, the role of video content in advertising has become increasingly significant. Typically, advertisers record a large amount of raw footage about the product and then create numerous different short-form advertisement videos based on this raw footage. Creating such videos mainly involves editing raw footage and writing advertisement scripts, which requires a certain level of creative ability. It is usually challenging to create many different video contents for the same product, and manual efficiency is often low. In this paper, we present VC-LLM, a framework powered by Large Language Models for the automatic creation of high-quality short-form advertisement videos. Our approach leverages high-resolution spatial input and low-resolution temporal input to represent video clips more effectively, capturing both fine-grained visual details and broader temporal dynamics. In addition, during training, we incorporate supplementary information generated by rewriting the ground truth text, ensuring that all key output information can be directly traced back to the input, thereby reducing model hallucinations. We also designed a benchmark to evaluate the quality of the created videos. Experiments show that VC-LLM based on GPT-4o can produce videos comparable to those created by humans. Furthermore, we collected numerous high-quality short advertisement videos to create a pre-training dataset and manually cleaned a portion of the data to construct a high-quality fine-tuning dataset. Experiments indicate that, on the benchmark, the VC-LLM based on fine-tuned LLM can produce videos with superior narrative logic compared to those created by the VC-LLM based on GPT-4o.

  _Shunsuke Sakai, Tatsuhito Hasegawa_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models, with their robust distribution approximation capabilities, have demonstrated excellent performance in anomaly detection. However, conventional reconstruction-based approaches rely on computing the reconstruction error between the original and denoised images, which requires careful noise-strength tuning and over ten network evaluations per input-leading to significantly slower detection speeds. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based anomaly detection method that circumvents the need for resource-intensive reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing the input image, we directly infer its corresponding latent variables and measure their density under the Gaussian prior distribution. Remarkably, the prior density proves effective as an anomaly score even when using a short partial diffusion process of only 2-5 steps. We evaluate our method on the MVTecAD dataset, achieving an AUC of 0.991 at 15 FPS, thereby setting a new state-of-the-art speed-AUC anomaly detection trade-off.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a fundamental task in the field of autonomous driving. This paper explores the unique advantage of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LiDAR in autonomous perception. Given a single frame FMCW point cloud with radial velocity measurements, we expect that our object detector can detect the short-term future locations of objects using only the current frame sensor data and demonstrate a fast ability to respond to intermediate danger. To achieve this, we extend the standard object detection task to a novel task named predictive object detection (POD), which aims to predict the short-term future location and dimensions of objects based solely on current observations. Typically, a motion prediction task requires historical sensor information to process the temporal contexts of each object, while our detector's avoidance of multi-frame historical information enables a much faster response time to potential dangers. The core advantage of FMCW LiDAR lies in the radial velocity associated with every reflected point. We propose a novel POD framework, the core idea of which is to generate a virtual future point using a ray casting mechanism, create virtual two-frame point clouds with the current and virtual future frames, and encode these two-frame voxel features with a sparse 4D encoder. Subsequently, the 4D voxel features are separated by temporal indices and remapped into two Bird's Eye View (BEV) features: one decoded for standard current frame object detection and the other for future predictive object detection. Extensive experiments on our in-house dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art standard and predictive detection performance of the proposed POD framework.

  Recent studies focus on the Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR), which aims at searching for the corresponding targets based on the given query. Among these efforts, the application of Foundation Models (FMs), such as CLIP, to the domain of remote sensing has yielded encouraging outcomes. However, existing FM based methodologies neglect the negative impact of weakly correlated sample pairs and fail to account for the key distinctions among remote sensing texts, leading to biased and superficial exploration of sample pairs. To address these challenges, we propose an approach named iEBAKER (an Improved Eliminate Before Align strategy with Keyword Explicit Reasoning framework) for RSITR. Specifically, we propose an innovative Eliminate Before Align (EBA) strategy to filter out the weakly correlated sample pairs, thereby mitigating their deviations from optimal embedding space duringthis http URL, two specific schemes are introduced from the perspective of whether local similarity and global similarity affect each other. On this basis, we introduce an alternative Sort After Reversed Retrieval (SAR) strategy, aims at optimizing the similarity matrix via reverse retrieval. Additionally, we incorporate a Keyword Explicit Reasoning (KER) module to facilitate the beneficial impact of subtle key concept distinctions. Without bells and whistles, our approach enables a direct transition from FM to RSITR task, eliminating the need for additional pretraining on remote sensing data. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed iEBAKER method surpasses the state-of-the-art models while requiring less training data.

  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health concern, necessitating precise and efficient image analysis to aid diagnosis and treatment planning. Automated segmentation of kidney pathology images plays a central role in facilitating clinical workflows, yet conventional segmentation models often require delicate threshold tuning. This paper proposes a novel \textit{Cascaded Threshold-Integrated U-Net (CTI-Unet)} to overcome the limitations of single-threshold segmentation. By sequentially integrating multiple thresholded outputs, our approach can reconcile noise suppression with the preservation of finer structural details. Experiments on the challenging KPIs2024 dataset demonstrate that CTI-Unet outperforms state-of-the-art architectures such as nnU-Net, Swin-Unet, and CE-Net, offering a robust and flexible framework for kidney pathology image segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cameras rely on auto white balance (AWB) to correct undesirable color casts caused by scene illumination and the camera's spectral sensitivity. This is typically achieved using an illuminant estimator that determines the global color cast solely from the color information in the camera's raw sensor image. Mobile devices provide valuable additional metadata-such as capture timestamp and geolocation-that offers strong contextual clues to help narrow down the possible illumination solutions. This paper proposes a lightweight illuminant estimation method that incorporates such contextual metadata, along with additional capture information and image colors, into a compact model (~5K parameters), achieving promising results, matching or surpassing larger models. To validate our method, we introduce a dataset of 3,224 smartphone images with contextual metadata collected at various times of day and under diverse lighting conditions. The dataset includes ground-truth illuminant colors, determined using a color chart, and user-preferred illuminants validated through a user study, providing a comprehensive benchmark for AWB evaluation.

  _Xiao Zhang, Xiangyu Han, Xiwen Lai, Yao Sun, Pei Zhang, Konrad Kording_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Today's unsupervised image segmentation algorithms often segment suboptimally. Modern graph-cut based approaches rely on high-dimensional attention maps from Transformer-based foundation models, typically employing a relaxed Normalized Cut solved recursively via the Fiedler vector (the eigenvector of the second smallest eigenvalue). Consequently, they still lag behind supervised methods in both mask generation speed and segmentation accuracy. We present a regularized fractional alternating cut (Falcon), an optimization-based K-way Normalized Cut without relying on recursive eigenvector computations, achieving substantially improved speed and accuracy. Falcon operates in two stages: (1) a fast K-way Normalized Cut solved by extending into a fractional quadratic transformation, with an alternating iterative procedure and regularization to avoid local minima; and (2) refinement of the resulting masks using complementary low-level information, producing high-quality pixel-level segmentations. Experiments show that Falcon not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 2.5% across six widely recognized benchmarks (reaching up to 4.3\% improvement on Cityscapes), but also reduces runtime by around 30% compared to prior graph-based approaches. These findings demonstrate that the semantic information within foundation-model attention can be effectively harnessed by a highly parallelizable graph cut framework. Consequently, Falcon can narrow the gap between unsupervised and supervised segmentation, enhancing scalability in real-world applications and paving the way for dense prediction-based vision pre-training in various downstream tasks. The code is released inthis https URL.

  _Zhenteng Li, Sheng Lian, Dengfeng Pan, Youlin Wang, Wei Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images poses significant challenges due to complex scale variations and class imbalance among objects. Existing methods often address these challenges separately, overlooking the intricate nature of UAV images and the potential synergy between them. In response, this paper proposes AD-Det, a novel framework employing a coherent coarse-to-fine strategy that seamlessly integrates two pivotal components: Adaptive Small Object Enhancement (ASOE) and Dynamic Class-balanced Copy-paste (DCC). ASOE utilizes a high-resolution feature map to identify and cluster regions containing small objects. These regions are subsequently enlarged and processed by a fine-grained detector. On the other hand, DCC conducts object-level resampling by dynamically pasting tail classes around the cluster centers obtained by ASOE, main-taining a dynamic memory bank for each tail class. This approach enables AD-Det to not only extract regions with small objects for precise detection but also dynamically perform reasonable resampling for tail-class objects. Consequently, AD-Det enhances the overall detection performance by addressing the challenges of scale variations and class imbalance in UAV images through a synergistic and adaptive framework. We extensively evaluate our approach on two public datasets, i.e., VisDrone and UAVDT, and demonstrate that AD-Det significantly outperforms existing competitive alternatives. Notably, AD-Det achieves a 37.5% Average Precision (AP) on the VisDrone dataset, surpassing its counterparts by at least 3.1%.

  We introduce Skywork R1V, a multimodal reasoning model extending the an R1-series Large language models (LLM) to visual modalities via an efficient multimodal transfer method. Leveraging a lightweight visual projector, Skywork R1V facilitates seamless multimodal adaptation without necessitating retraining of either the foundational language model or the vision encoder. To strengthen visual-text alignment, we propose a hybrid optimization strategy that combines Iterative Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), significantly enhancing cross-modal integration efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive-length Chain-of-Thought distillation approach for reasoning data generation. This approach dynamically optimizes reasoning chain lengths, thereby enhancing inference efficiency and preventing excessive reasoning overthinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Skywork R1V, with only 38B parameters, delivers competitive performance, achieving a score of 69.0 on the MMMU benchmark and 67.5 on MathVista. Meanwhile, it maintains robust textual reasoning performance, evidenced by impressive scores of 72.0 on AIME and 94.0 on MATH500. The Skywork R1V model weights have been publicly released to promote openness and reproducibility.

  _Qi Mao, Lan Chen, Yuchao Gu, Mike Zheng Shou, Ming-Hsuan Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Balancing fidelity and editability is essential in text-based image editing (TIE), where failures commonly lead to over- or under-editing issues. Existing methods typically rely on attention injections for structure preservation and leverage the inherent text alignment capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models for editability, but they lack explicit and unified mechanisms to properly balance these two objectives. In this work, we introduce UnifyEdit, a tuning-free method that performs diffusion latent optimization to enable a balanced integration of fidelity and editability within a unified framework. Unlike direct attention injections, we develop two attention-based constraints: a self-attention (SA) preservation constraint for structural fidelity, and a cross-attention (CA) alignment constraint to enhance text alignment for improved editability. However, simultaneously applying both constraints can lead to gradient conflicts, where the dominance of one constraint results in over- or under-editing. To address this challenge, we introduce an adaptive time-step scheduler that dynamically adjusts the influence of these constraints, guiding the diffusion latent toward an optimal balance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority in achieving a robust balance between structure preservation and text alignment across various editing tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning-based image dehazing algorithms have shown remarkable success in synthetic domains. However, real image dehazing is still in suspense due to computational resource constraints and the diversity of real-world scenes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an algorithm that excels in both efficiency and adaptability to address real image dehazing effectively. This work proposes a Compression-and-Adaptation (CoA) computational flow to tackle these challenges from a divide-and-conquer perspective. First, model compression is performed in the synthetic domain to develop a compact dehazing parameter space, satisfying efficiency demands. Then, a bilevel adaptation in the real domain is introduced to be fearless in unknown real environments by aggregating the synthetic dehazing capabilities during the learning process. Leveraging a succinct design free from additional constraints, our CoA exhibits domain-irrelevant stability and model-agnostic flexibility, effectively bridging the model chasm between synthetic and real domains to further improve its practical utility. Extensive evaluations and analyses underscore the approach's superiority and effectiveness. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inspired by human visual attention, deep neural networks have widely adopted attention mechanisms to learn locally discriminative attributes for challenging visual classification tasks. However, existing approaches primarily emphasize the representation of such features while neglecting their precise localization, which often leads to misclassification caused by shortcut biases. This limitation becomes even more pronounced when models are evaluated on transfer or out-of-distribution datasets. In contrast, humans are capable of leveraging prior object knowledge to quickly localize and compare fine-grained attributes, a capability that is especially crucial in complex and high-variance classification scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce Gaze-CIFAR-10, a human gaze time-series dataset, along with a dual-sequence gaze encoder that models the precise sequential localization of human attention on distinct local attributes. In parallel, a Vision Transformer (ViT) is employed to learn the sequential representation of image content. Through cross-modal fusion, our framework integrates human gaze priors with machine-derived visual sequences, effectively correcting inaccurate localization in image feature representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that gaze-guided cognitive cues significantly enhance classification accuracy.

  Tracking Any Point (TAP) in a video is a challenging computer vision problem with many demonstrated applications in robotics, video editing, and 3D reconstruction. Existing methods for TAP rely heavily on complex tracking-specific inductive biases and heuristics, limiting their generality and potential for scaling. To address these challenges, we present TAPNext, a new approach that casts TAP as sequential masked token decoding. Our model is causal, tracks in a purely online fashion, and removes tracking-specific inductive biases. This enables TAPNext to run with minimal latency, and removes the temporal windowing required by many existing state of art trackers. Despite its simplicity, TAPNext achieves a new state-of-the-art tracking performance among both online and offline trackers. Finally, we present evidence that many widely used tracking heuristics emerge naturally in TAPNext through end-to-end training.

  We present CAT-V (Caption AnyThing in Video), a training-free framework for fine-grained object-centric video captioning that enables detailed descriptions of user-selected objects through time. CAT-V integrates three key components: a Segmenter based on SAMURAI for precise object segmentation across frames, a Temporal Analyzer powered by TRACE-Uni for accurate event boundary detection and temporal analysis, and a Captioner using InternVL-2.5 for generating detailed object-centric descriptions. Through spatiotemporal visual prompts and chain-of-thought reasoning, our framework generates detailed, temporally-aware descriptions of objects' attributes, actions, statuses, interactions, and environmental contexts without requiring additional training data. CAT-V supports flexible user interactions through various visual prompts (points, bounding boxes, and irregular regions) and maintains temporal sensitivity by tracking object states and interactions across different time segments. Our approach addresses limitations of existing video captioning methods, which either produce overly abstract descriptions or lack object-level precision, enabling fine-grained, object-specific descriptions while maintaining temporal coherence and spatial accuracy.

  We propose a deep learning framework designed to significantly optimize bandwidth for motion-transfer-enabled video applications, including video conferencing, virtual reality interactions, health monitoring systems, and vision-based real-time anomaly detection. To capture complex motion effectively, we utilize the First Order Motion Model (FOMM), which encodes dynamic objects by detecting keypoints and their associated local affine transformations. These keypoints are identified using a self-supervised keypoint detector and arranged into a time series corresponding to the successive frames. Forecasting is performed on these keypoints by integrating two advanced generative time series models into the motion transfer pipeline, namely the Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) and the Gated Recurrent Unit with Normalizing Flow (GRU-NF). The predicted keypoints are subsequently synthesized into realistic video frames using an optical flow estimator paired with a generator network, thereby facilitating accurate video forecasting and enabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. We validate our results across three datasets for video animation and reconstruction using the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture Embedding Distance, Structural Similarity Index, and Average Pair-wise Displacement. Our results confirm that by utilizing the superior reconstruction property of the Variational Autoencoder, the VRNN integrated FOMM excels in applications involving multi-step ahead forecasts such as video conferencing. On the other hand, by leveraging the Normalizing Flow architecture for exact likelihood estimation, and enabling efficient latent space sampling, the GRU-NF based FOMM exhibits superior capabilities for producing diverse future samples while maintaining high visual quality for tasks like real-time video-based anomaly detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the continuous advancement of generative models, face morphing attacks have become a significant challenge for existing face verification systems due to their potential use in identity fraud and other malicious activities. Contemporary Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) approaches frequently rely on supervised, discriminative models trained on examples of bona fide and morphed images. These models typically perform well with morphs generated with techniques seen during training, but often lead to sub-optimal performance when subjected to novel unseen morphing techniques. While unsupervised models have been shown to perform better in terms of generalizability, they typically result in higher error rates, as they struggle to effectively capture features of subtle artifacts. To address these shortcomings, we present SelfMAD, a novel self-supervised approach that simulates general morphing attack artifacts, allowing classifiers to learn generic and robust decision boundaries without overfitting to the specific artifacts induced by particular face morphing methods. Through extensive experiments on widely used datasets, we demonstrate that SelfMAD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art MADs, reducing the detection error by more than 64% in terms of EER when compared to the strongest unsupervised competitor, and by more than 66%, when compared to the best performing discriminative MAD model, tested in cross-morph settings.

  A personalized model for scanpath prediction provides insights into the visual preferences and attention patterns of individual subjects. However, existing methods for training scanpath prediction models are data-intensive and cannot be effectively personalized to new individuals with only a few available examples. In this paper, we propose few-shot personalized scanpath prediction task (FS-PSP) and a novel method to address it, which aims to predict scanpaths for an unseen subject using minimal support data of that subject's scanpath behavior. The key to our method's adaptability is the Subject-Embedding Network (SE-Net), specifically designed to capture unique, individualized representations for each subject's scanpaths. SE-Net generates subject embeddings that effectively distinguish between subjects while minimizing variability among scanpaths from the same individual. The personalized scanpath prediction model is then conditioned on these subject embeddings to produce accurate, personalized results. Experiments on multiple eye-tracking datasets demonstrate that our method excels in FS-PSP settings and does not require any fine-tuning steps at test time. Code is available at:this https URL

Recent methods often utilize memory banks to handle untrimmed videos for video-level understanding. However, they typically compress visual memory using similarity-based greedy approaches, which can overlook the contextual importance of individual tokens. To address this, we introduce an efficient LLM adapter designed for video-level understanding of untrimmed videos that prioritizes the contextual relevance of spatio-temporal tokens. Our framework leverages scorer networks to selectively compress the visual memory bank and filter spatial tokens based on relevance, using a differentiable Top-K operator for end-to-end training. Across three key video-level understanding tasks$\unicode{x2013}$ untrimmed video classification, video question answering, and video captioning$\unicode{x2013}$our method achieves competitive or superior results on four large-scale datasets while reducing computational overhead by up to 34%. The code will be available soon on GitHub.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks for medical image classification often fail to generalize consistently in clinical practice due to violations of the i.i.d. assumption and opaque decision-making. This paper examines interpretability in deep neural networks fine-tuned for fracture detection by evaluating model performance against adversarial attack and comparing interpretability methods to fracture regions annotated by an orthopedic surgeon. Our findings prove that robust models yield explanations more aligned with clinically meaningful areas, indicating that robustness encourages anatomically relevant feature prioritization. We emphasize the value of interpretability for facilitating human-AI collaboration, in which models serve as assistants under a human-in-the-loop paradigm: clinically plausible explanations foster trust, enable error correction, and discourage reliance on AI for high-stakes decisions. This paper investigates robustness and interpretability as complementary benchmarks for bridging the gap between benchmark performance and safe, actionable clinical deployment.

  This paper investigates the use of large-scale diffusion models for Zero-Shot Video Object Segmentation (ZS-VOS) without fine-tuning on video data or training on any image segmentation data. While diffusion models have demonstrated strong visual representations across various tasks, their direct application to ZS-VOS remains underexplored. Our goal is to find the optimal feature extraction process for ZS-VOS by identifying the most suitable time step and layer from which to extract features. We further analyze the affinity of these features and observe a strong correlation with point correspondences. Through extensive experiments on DAVIS-17 and MOSE, we find that diffusion models trained on ImageNet outperform those trained on larger, more diverse datasets for ZS-VOS. Additionally, we highlight the importance of point correspondences in achieving high segmentation accuracy, and we yield state-of-the-art results in ZS-VOS. Finally, our approach performs on par with models trained on expensive image segmentation datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video-Question-Answering (VideoQA) comprises the capturing of complex visual relation changes over time, remaining a challenge even for advanced Video Language Models (VLM), i.a., because of the need to represent the visual content to a reasonably sized input for those models. To address this problem, we proposeRElation-based Video rEpresentAtion Learning (REVEAL), a framework designed to capture visual relation information by encoding them into structured, decomposed representations. Specifically, inspired by spatiotemporal scene graphs, we propose to encode video sequences as sets of relation triplets in the form of (\textit{subject-predicate-object}) over time via their language embeddings. To this end, we extract explicit relations from video captions and introduce a Many-to-Many Noise Contrastive Estimation (MM-NCE) together with a Q-Former architecture to align an unordered set of video-derived queries with corresponding text-based relation descriptions. At inference, the resulting Q-former produces an efficient token representation that can serve as input to a VLM for VideoQA.We evaluate the proposed framework on five challenging benchmarks: NeXT-QA, Intent-QA, STAR, VLEP, and TVQA. It shows that the resulting query-based video representation is able to outperform global alignment-based CLS or patch token representations and achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art models, particularly on tasks requiring temporal reasoning and relation comprehension. The code and models will be publicly released.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To achieve realistic immersion in landscape images, fluids such as water and clouds need to move within the image while revealing new scenes from various camera perspectives. Recently, a field called dynamic scene video has emerged, which combines single image animation with 3D photography. These methods use pseudo 3D space, implicitly represented with Layered Depth Images (LDIs). LDIs separate a single image into depth-based layers, which enables elements like water and clouds to move within the image while revealing new scenes from different camera perspectives. However, as landscapes typically consist of continuous elements, including fluids, the representation of a 3D space separates a landscape image into discrete layers, and it can lead to diminished depth perception and potential distortions depending on camera movement. Furthermore, due to its implicit modeling of 3D space, the output may be limited to videos in the 2D domain, potentially reducing their versatility. In this paper, we propose representing a complete 3D space for dynamic scene video by modeling explicit representations, specifically 4D Gaussians, from a single image. The framework is focused on optimizing 3D Gaussians by generating multi-view images from a single image and creating 3D motion to optimize 4D Gaussians. The most important part of proposed framework is consistent 3D motion estimation, which estimates common motion among multi-view images to bring the motion in 3D space closer to actual motions. As far as we know, this is the first attempt that considers animation while representing a complete 3D space from a single landscape image. Our model demonstrates the ability to provide realistic immersion in various landscape images through diverse experiments and metrics. Extensive experimental results arethis https URL.

  When a vision-language model (VLM) is prompted to identify an entity depicted in an image, it may answer 'I see a conifer,' rather than the specific label 'norway spruce'. This raises two issues for evaluation: First, the unconstrained generated text needs to be mapped to the evaluation label space (i.e., 'conifer'). Second, a useful classification measure should give partial credit to less-specific, but not incorrect, answers ('norway spruce' being a type of 'conifer'). To meet these requirements, we propose a framework for evaluating unconstrained text predictions, such as those generated from a vision-language model, against a taxonomy. Specifically, we propose the use of hierarchical precision and recall measures to assess the level of correctness and specificity of predictions with regard to a taxonomy. Experimentally, we first show that existing text similarity measures do not capture taxonomic similarity well. We then develop and compare different methods to map textual VLM predictions onto a taxonomy. This allows us to compute hierarchical similarity measures between the generated text and the ground truth labels. Finally, we analyze modern VLMs on fine-grained visual classification tasks based on our proposed taxonomic evaluation scheme.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown impressive results in various image synthesis tasks. Vast studies have demonstrated that GANs are more powerful in feature and expression learning compared to other generative models and their latent space encodes rich semantic information. However, the tremendous performance of GANs heavily relies on the access to large-scale training data and deteriorates rapidly when the amount of data is limited. This paper aims to provide an overview of GANs, its variants and applications in various vision tasks, focusing on addressing the limited data issue. We analyze state-of-the-art GANs in limited data regime with designed experiments, along with presenting various methods attempt to tackle this problem from different perspectives. Finally, we further elaborate on remaining challenges and trends for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional methods for view-invariant learning from video rely on controlled multi-view settings with minimal scene clutter. However, they struggle with in-the-wild videos that exhibit extreme viewpoint differences and share little visual content. We introduce a method for learning rich video representations in the presence of such severe view-occlusions. We first define a geometry-based metric that ranks views at a fine-grained temporal scale by their likely occlusion level. Then, using those rankings, we formulate a knowledge distillation objective that preserves action-centric semantics with a novel curriculum learning procedure that pairs incrementally more challenging views over time, thereby allowing smooth adaptation to extreme viewpoint differences. We evaluate our approach on two tasks, outperforming SOTA models on both temporal keystep grounding and fine-grained keystep recognition benchmarks - particularly on views that exhibit severe occlusion.

  _Ziad Kheil, Soleakhena Ken, Laurent Risser_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Regularization strategies in medical image registration often take a one-size-fits-all approach by imposing uniform constraints across the entire image domain. Yet biological structures are anything but regular. Lacking structural awareness, these strategies may fail to consider a panoply of spatially inhomogeneous deformation properties, which would faithfully account for the biomechanics of soft and hard tissues, especially in poorly contrasted structures.To bridge this gap, we propose a learning-based image registration approach in which the inferred deformation properties can locally adapt themselves to trained biomechanical characteristics. Specifically, we first enforce in the training process local rigid displacements, shearing motions or pseudo-elastic deformations using regularization losses inspired from the field of solid-mechanics. We then show on synthetic and real 3D thoracic and abdominal images that these mechanical properties of different nature are well generalized when inferring the deformations between new image pairs. Our approach enables neural-networks to infer tissue-specific deformation patterns directly from input images, ensuring mechanically plausible motion. These networks preserve rigidity within hard tissues while allowing controlled sliding in regions where tissues naturally separate, more faithfully capturing physiological motion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose a new diffusion-based method for video frame interpolation (VFI), in the context of traditional hand-made animation. We introduce three main contributions: The first is that we explicitly handle the interpolation time in our model, which we also re-estimate during the training process, to cope with the particularly large variations observed in the animation domain, compared to natural videos; The second is that we adapt and generalize a diffusion scheme called ResShift recently proposed in the super-resolution community to VFI, which allows us to perform a very low number of diffusion steps (in the order of 10) to produce our estimates; The third is that we leverage the stochastic nature of the diffusion process to provide a pixel-wise estimate of the uncertainty on the interpolated frame, which could be useful to anticipate where the model may be wrong. We provide extensive comparisons with respect to state-of-the-art models and show that our model outperforms these models on animation videos.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D reassembly is a challenging spatial intelligence task with broad applications across scientific domains. While large-scale synthetic datasets have fueled promising learning-based approaches, their generalizability to different domains is limited. Critically, it remains uncertain whether models trained on synthetic datasets can generalize to real-world fractures where breakage patterns are more complex. To bridge this gap, we propose GARF, a generalizable 3D reassembly framework for real-world fractures. GARF leverages fracture-aware pretraining to learn fracture features from individual fragments, with flow matching enabling precise 6-DoF alignments. At inference time, we introduce one-step preassembly, improving robustness to unseen objects and varying numbers of fractures. In collaboration with archaeologists, paleoanthropologists, and ornithologists, we curate Fractura, a diverse dataset for vision and learning communities, featuring real-world fracture types across ceramics, bones, eggshells, and lithics. Comprehensive experiments have shown our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving 82.87\% lower rotation error and 25.15\% higher part accuracy. This sheds light on training on synthetic data to advance real-world 3D puzzle solving, demonstrating its strong generalization across unseen object shapes and diverse fracture types.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Lunima-OmniLV (abbreviated as OmniLV), a universal multimodal multi-task framework for low-level vision that addresses over 100 sub-tasks across four major categories: image restoration, image enhancement, weak-semantic dense prediction, and stylization. OmniLV leverages both textual and visual prompts to offer flexible and user-friendly interactions. Built on Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based generative priors, our framework supports arbitrary resolutions -- achieving optimal performance at 1K resolution -- while preserving fine-grained details and high fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that separately encoding text and visual instructions, combined with co-training using shallow feature control, is essential to mitigate task ambiguity and enhance multi-task generalization. Our findings also reveal that integrating high-level generative tasks into low-level vision models can compromise detail-sensitive restoration. These insights pave the way for more robust and generalizable low-level vision systems.

  Generative diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools to synthetically produce training data, offering potential solutions to data scarcity and reducing labelling costs for downstream supervised deep learning applications. However, effectively leveraging text-conditioned image generation for building classifier training sets requires addressing key issues: constructing informative textual prompts, adapting generative models to specific domains, and ensuring robust performance. This paper proposes the Text-Conditioned Knowledge Recycling (TCKR) pipeline to tackle these challenges. TCKR combines dynamic image captioning, parameter-efficient diffusion model fine-tuning, and Generative Knowledge Distillation techniques to create synthetic datasets tailored for image classification. The pipeline is rigorously evaluated on ten diverse image classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that models trained solely on TCKR-generated data achieve classification accuracies on par with (and in several cases exceeding) models trained on real images. Furthermore, the evaluation reveals that these synthetic-data-trained models exhibit substantially enhanced privacy characteristics: their vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks is significantly reduced, with the membership inference AUC lowered by 5.49 points on average compared to using real training data, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the performance-privacy trade-off. These findings indicate that high-fidelity synthetic data can effectively replace real data for training classifiers, yielding strong performance whilst simultaneously providing improved privacy protection as a valuable emergent property. The code and trained models are available in the accompanying open-source repository.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In Visual Document Understanding (VDU) tasks, fine-tuning a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) with new datasets often falls short in optimizing the vision encoder to identify query-specific regions in text-rich document images. Existing methods that directly inject queries into model layers by modifying the network architecture often struggle to adapt to new datasets with limited annotations. To address this, we introduce QID, a novel, streamlined, architecture-preserving approach that integrates query embeddings into the vision encoder, leading to notable performance gains, particularly in data-scarce fine-tuning scenarios. Specifically, our approach introduces a dual-module framework: a query-aware module that generates a unique query vector to precisely guide the model's focus, as well as a query-agnostic module that captures the positional relationships among tokens, ensuring robust spatial understanding. Notably, both modules operate independently of the vision attention blocks, facilitating targeted learning of query embeddings and enhancing visual semantic identification. Experiments with OCR-free VLMs across multiple datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements using our method, especially in handling text-rich documents in data-scarce environments.

  Large Multi-modality Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in visual understanding and generation, but they still face challenges in General Visual Editing, particularly in following complex instructions, preserving appearance consistency, and supporting flexible input formats. To address this gap, we introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning types: Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for each category and propose an evaluation framework that assesses Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human judges and an LMM-as-a-judge approach. Our experiments reveal that while GPT-4o-Native significantly outperforms other open-source and proprietary models, even this state-of-the-art system struggles with logical reasoning tasks, highlighting an area that remains underexplored. As an initial effort, RISEBench aims to provide foundational insights into reasoning-aware visual editing and to catalyze future research. Though still in its early stages, we are committed to continuously expanding and refining the benchmark to support more comprehensive, reliable, and scalable evaluations of next-generation multimodal systems. Our code and data will be released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly in processing multimodal information, but their ability to reconcile conflicting signals across modalities remains underexplored. This work investigates how VLMs process ASCII art, a unique medium where textual elements collectively form visual patterns, potentially creating semantic-visual conflicts. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that systematically challenges five state-of-the-art models (including GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini) using adversarial ASCII art, where character-level semantics deliberately contradict global visual patterns. Our experiments reveal a strong text-priority bias: VLMs consistently prioritize textual information over visual patterns, with visual recognition ability declining dramatically as semantic complexity increases. Various mitigation attempts through visual parameter tuning and prompt engineering yielded only modest improvements, suggesting that this limitation requires architectural-level solutions. These findings uncover fundamental flaws in how current VLMs integrate multimodal information, providing important guidance for future model development while highlighting significant implications for content moderation systems vulnerable to adversarial examples.

  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have become a popular 3D reconstruction approach in recent years. While they produce high-quality results, they also demand lengthy training times, often spanning days. This paper studies neural pruning as a strategy to address these concerns. We compare pruning approaches, including uniform sampling, importance-based methods, and coreset-based techniques, to reduce the model size and speed up training. Our findings show that coreset-driven pruning can achieve a 50% reduction in model size and a 35% speedup in training, with only a slight decrease in accuracy. These results suggest that pruning can be an effective method for improving the efficiency of NeRF models in resource-limited settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in novel view synthesis but is limited by the substantial number of Gaussian primitives required, posing challenges for deployment on lightweight devices. Recent methods address this issue by compressing the storage size of densified Gaussians, yet fail to preserve rendering quality and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoGS to learn Gaussian prototypes to represent Gaussian primitives, significantly reducing the total Gaussian amount without sacrificing visual quality. Our method directly uses Gaussian prototypes to enable efficient rendering and leverage the resulting reconstruction loss to guide prototype learning. To further optimize memory efficiency during training, we incorporate structure-from-motion (SfM) points as anchor points to group Gaussian primitives. Gaussian prototypes are derived within each group by clustering of K-means, and both the anchor points and the prototypes are optimized jointly. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets prove that we outperform existing methods, achieving a substantial reduction in the number of Gaussians, and enabling high rendering speed while maintaining or even enhancing rendering fidelity.

  Despite the recent success of image-text contrastive models like CLIP and SigLIP, these models often struggle with vision-centric tasks that demand high-fidelity image understanding, such as counting, depth estimation, and fine-grained object recognition. These models, by performing language alignment, tend to prioritize high-level semantics over visual understanding, weakening their image understanding. On the other hand, vision-focused models are great at processing visual information but struggle to understand language, limiting their flexibility for language-driven tasks. In this work, we introduce TULIP, an open-source, drop-in replacement for existing CLIP-like models. Our method leverages generative data augmentation, enhanced image-image and text-text contrastive learning, and image/text reconstruction regularization to learn fine-grained visual features while preserving global semantic alignment. Our approach, scaling to over 1B parameters, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple benchmarks, establishing a new SOTA zero-shot performance on ImageNet-1K, delivering up to a $2\times$ enhancement over SigLIP on RxRx1 in linear probing for few-shot classification, and improving vision-language models, achieving over $3\times$ higher scores than SigLIP on MMVP.

  Humans inhabit a world defined by interactions -- with other humans, objects, and environments. These interactive movements not only convey our relationships with our surroundings but also demonstrate how we perceive and communicate with the real world. Therefore, replicating these interaction behaviors in digital systems has emerged as an important topic for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and animation. While recent advances in deep generative models and new datasets have accelerated progress in this field, significant challenges remain in modeling the intricate human dynamics and their interactions with entities in the external world. In this survey, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive overview of the literature in human interaction motion generation. We begin by establishing foundational concepts essential for understanding the research background. We then systematically review existing solutions and datasets across three primary interaction tasks -- human-human, human-object, and human-scene interactions -- followed by evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss open research directions and future opportunities.

  Accurate material retrieval is critical for creating realistic 3D assets. Existing methods rely on datasets that capture shape-invariant and lighting-varied representations of materials, which are scarce and face challenges due to limited diversity and inadequate real-world generalization. Most current approaches adopt traditional image search techniques. They fall short in capturing the unique properties of material spaces, leading to suboptimal performance in retrieval tasks. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MaRI, a framework designed to bridge the feature space gap between synthetic and real-world materials. MaRI constructs a shared embedding space that harmonizes visual and material attributes through a contrastive learning strategy by jointly training an image and a material encoder, bringing similar materials and images closer while separating dissimilar pairs within the feature space. To support this, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising high-quality synthetic materials rendered with controlled shape variations and diverse lighting conditions, along with real-world materials processed and standardized using material transfer techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance, accuracy, and generalization capabilities of MaRI across diverse and complex material retrieval tasks, outperforming existing methods.

  Since the establishment of vision-language foundation models as the new mainstay in low-shot vision classification tasks, the question of domain generalization arising from insufficient target data is assuming more importance. This scarcity challenge induces sampling bias and amplifies model sensitivity to variations and shifts in data distributions. While fine-tuning on multiple domains could mitigate such domain generalization issues, it is resource-intensive and demands diverse data sources.In this work, we systematically analyze two critical challenges: (1) covariate shift between the pre-training distribution and the underspecified target distribution, and (2) confidence misalignment, where predictions on novel data are overconfident.To address both challenges simultaneously, we introduce \textbf{Confidence-Calibrated Covariate Shift Correction (CalShift)} -- a unified approach that combines a Fisher information penalty to mitigate covariate shift and a Confidence Misalignment Penalty (CMP) to reduce overconfidence in misclassified examples.Experimental evaluations across various vision and covariate shift benchmarks demonstrate that CalShift significantly improves model calibration, achieving up to a 5.82\% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Furthermore, CalShift enhances robustness, improving accuracy by 3.5\% on challenging datasets impacted by covariate shifts.Our results highlight CalShift as a promising strategy for building robust and reliable low-shot vision-language systems for real-world applications.

  The potato is a widely grown crop in many regions of the world. In recent decades, potato farming has gained incredible traction in the world. Potatoes are susceptible to several illnesses that stunt their development. This plant seems to have significant leaf disease. Early Blight and Late Blight are two prevalent leaf diseases that affect potato plants. The early detection of these diseases would be beneficial for enhancing the yield of this crop. The ideal solution is to use image processing to identify and analyze these disorders. Here, we present an autonomous method based on image processing and machine learning to detect late blight disease affecting potato leaves. The proposed method comprises four different phases: (1) Histogram Equalization is used to improve the quality of the input image; (2) feature extraction is performed using a Deep CNN model, then these extracted features are concatenated; (3) feature selection is performed using wrapper-based feature selection; (4) classification is performed using an SVM classifier and its variants. This proposed method achieves the highest accuracy of 99% using SVM by selecting 550 features.

- **[Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02514)**  `arXiv:2502.02514`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image autoregressive generation has emerged as a powerful new paradigm, with image autoregressive models (IARs) matching state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) in image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) while allowing for higher generation speed. However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns about their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to those of DMs as a reference point. Specifically, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images, with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% (TPR@FPR=1%) of 86.38%, compared to just 6.38% for DMs using comparable attacks. We leverage our novel MIA to perform dataset inference (DI) for IARs and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership, compared to 200 samples for DI in DMs. This confirms a higher level of information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance. This trend suggests that incorporating techniques from DMs into IARs, such as modeling the per-token probability distribution using a diffusion procedure, could help mitigate IARs' vulnerability to privacy attacks.

  _Shilong Hong, Yanzhou Zhou, Weichao Xu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of modern transportation systems and the exponential growth of logistics volumes, intelligent X-ray-based security inspection systems play a crucial role in public safety. Although single-view X-ray equipment is widely deployed, it struggles to accurately identify contraband in complex stacking scenarios due to strong viewpoint dependency and inadequate feature representation. To address this, we propose an innovative multi-scale interactive feature fusion framework tailored for dual-view X-ray security inspection image classification. The framework comprises three core modules: the Frequency Domain Interaction Module (FDIM) enhances frequency-domain features through Fourier transform; the Multi-Scale Cross-View Feature Enhancement (MSCFE) leverages cross-view attention mechanisms to strengthen feature interactions; and the Convolutional Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) efficiently fuses features by integrating channel attention with depthwise-separable convolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple backbone architectures, particularly excelling in complex scenarios with occlusions and object stacking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the field of deep learning-based computer vision, YOLO is revolutionary. With respect to deep learning models, YOLO is also the one that is evolving the most rapidly. Unfortunately, not every YOLO model possesses scholarly publications. Moreover, there exists a YOLO model that lacks a publicly accessible official architectural diagram. Naturally, this engenders challenges, such as complicating the understanding of how the model operates in practice. Furthermore, the review articles that are presently available do not delve into the specifics of each model. The objective of this study is to present a comprehensive and in-depth architecture comparison of the four most recent YOLO models, specifically YOLOv8 through YOLO11, thereby enabling readers to quickly grasp not only how each model functions, but also the distinctions between them. To analyze each YOLO version's architecture, we meticulously examined the relevant academic papers, documentation, and scrutinized the source code. The analysis reveals that while each version of YOLO has improvements in architecture and feature extraction, certain blocks remain unchanged. The lack of scholarly publications and official diagrams presents challenges for understanding the model's functionality and future enhancement. Future developers are encouraged to provide these resources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the robustness of vision-language models against adversarial visual perturbations and introduces a novel ``double visual defense" to enhance this robustness. Unlike previous approaches that resort to lightweight adversarial fine-tuning of a pre-trained CLIP model, we perform large-scale adversarial vision-language pre-training from scratch using web-scale data. We then strengthen the defense by incorporating adversarial visual instruction tuning. The resulting models from each stage, $\Delta$CLIP and $\Delta^2$LLaVA, show substantially enhanced zero-shot robustness and set a new state-of-the-art in adversarial defense for vision-language models. For example, the adversarial robustness of $\Delta$CLIP surpasses that of the previous best models on ImageNet-1k by ~20%. %For example, $\Delta$CLIP surpasses the previous best models on ImageNet-1k by ~20% in terms of adversarial robustness. Similarly, compared to prior art, $\Delta^2$LLaVA brings a ~30% robustness improvement to image captioning task and a ~20% robustness improvement to visual question answering task. Furthermore, our models exhibit stronger zero-shot recognition capability, fewer hallucinations, and superior reasoning performance compared to baselines. Our project page isthis https URL.

  _Arpita Chowdhury, Dipanjyoti Paul, Zheda Mai, Jianyang Gu, Ziheng Zhang, Kazi Sajeed Mehrab, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a simple approach to make pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) interpretable for fine-grained analysis, aiming to identify and localize the traits that distinguish visually similar categories, such as bird species. Pre-trained ViTs, such as DINO, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in extracting localized, discriminative features. However, saliency maps like Grad-CAM often fail to identify these traits, producing blurred, coarse heatmaps that highlight entire objects instead. We propose a novel approach, Prompt Class Attention Map (Prompt-CAM), to address this limitation. Prompt-CAM learns class-specific prompts for a pre-trained ViT and uses the corresponding outputs for classification. To correctly classify an image, the true-class prompt must attend to unique image patches not present in other classes' images (i.e., traits). As a result, the true class's multi-head attention maps reveal traits and their locations. Implementation-wise, Prompt-CAM is almost a ``free lunch,'' requiring only a modification to the prediction head of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT). This makes Prompt-CAM easy to train and apply, in stark contrast to other interpretable methods that require designing specific models and training processes. Extensive empirical studies on a dozen datasets from various domains (e.g., birds, fishes, insects, fungi, flowers, food, and cars) validate the superior interpretation capability of Prompt-CAM.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models have undergone significant advancements over recent years. Many MDE models aim to predict affine-invariant relative depth from monocular images, while recent developments in large-scale training and vision foundation models enable reasonable estimation of metric (absolute) depth. However, effectively leveraging these predictions for geometric vision tasks, in particular relative pose estimation, remains relatively under explored. While depths provide rich constraints for cross-view image alignment, the intrinsic noise and ambiguity from the monocular depth priors present practical challenges to improving upon classic keypoint-based solutions. In this paper, we develop three solvers for relative pose estimation that explicitly account for independent affine (scale and shift) ambiguities, covering both calibrated and uncalibrated conditions. We further propose a hybrid estimation pipeline that combines our proposed solvers with classic point-based solvers and epipolar constraints. We find that the affine correction modeling is beneficial to not only the relative depth priors but also, surprisingly, the "metric" ones. Results across multiple datasets demonstrate large improvements of our approach over classic keypoint-based baselines and PnP-based solutions, under both calibrated and uncalibrated setups. We also show that our method improves consistently with different feature matchers and MDE models, and can further benefit from very recent advances on both modules.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs) remains limited due to over-reliance on textual cues and memorized knowledge. To investigate the visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs in complex real-world scenarios, we introduce DrivingVQA, a visual question answering dataset derived from driving theory exams, which contains 3,931 multiple-choice problems with expert-written explanations and grounded entities relevant to the reasoning process. Leveraging this dataset, we propose RIV-CoT, a Retrieval-Based Interleaved Visual Chain-of-Thought method that enables VLMs to reason using visual crops corresponding to these relevant entities. Our experiments demonstrate that RIV-CoT improves answer accuracy by 3.1% and reasoning accuracy by 4.6% over vanilla CoT prompting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method effectively scales to the larger A-OKVQA reasoning dataset by leveraging automatically generated pseudo-labels, outperforming CoT prompting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual odometry (VO) aims to estimate camera poses from visual inputs -- a fundamental building block for many applications such as VR/AR and robotics. This work focuses on monocular RGB VO where the input is a monocular RGB video without IMU or 3D sensors. Existing approaches lack robustness under this challenging scenario and fail to generalize to unseen data (especially outdoors); they also cannot recover metric-scale poses. We propose Robust Metric Visual Odometry (RoMeO), a novel method that resolves these issues leveraging priors from pre-trained depth models. RoMeO incorporates both monocular metric depth and multi-view stereo (MVS) models to recover metric-scale, simplify correspondence search, provide better initialization and regularize optimization. Effective strategies are proposed to inject noise during training and adaptively filter noisy depth priors, which ensure the robustness of RoMeO on in-the-wild data. As shown in Fig.1, RoMeO advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin across 6 diverse datasets covering both indoor and outdoor scenes. Compared to the current SOTA DPVO, RoMeO reduces the relative (align the trajectory scale with GT) and absolute trajectory errors both by >50%. The performance gain also transfers to the full SLAM pipeline (with global BA & loop closure). Code will be released upon acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current advanced policy learning methodologies have demonstrated the ability to develop expert-level strategies when provided enough information. However, their requirements, including task-specific rewards, action-labeled expert trajectories, and huge environmental interactions, can be expensive or even unavailable in many scenarios. In contrast, humans can efficiently acquire skills within a few trials and errors by imitating easily accessible internet videos, in the absence of any other supervision. In this paper, we try to let machines replicate this efficient watching-and-learning process through Unsupervised Policy from Ensemble Self-supervised labeled Videos (UPESV), a novel framework to efficiently learn policies from action-free videos without rewards and any other expert supervision. UPESV trains a video labeling model to infer the expert actions in expert videos through several organically combined self-supervised tasks. Each task performs its duties, and they together enable the model to make full use of both action-free videos and reward-free interactions for robust dynamics understanding and advanced action prediction. Simultaneously, UPESV clones a policy from the labeled expert videos, in turn collecting environmental interactions for self-supervised tasks. After a sample-efficient, unsupervised, and iterative training process, UPESV obtains an advanced policy based on a robust video labeling model. Extensive experiments in sixteen challenging procedurally generated environments demonstrate that the proposed UPESV achieves state-of-the-art interaction-limited policy learning performance (outperforming five current advanced baselines on 12/16 tasks) without exposure to any other supervision except for videos.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We tackle the ill-posed inverse rendering problem in 3D reconstruction with a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approach informed by Physics-Based Rendering (PBR) theory, named PBR-NeRF. Our method addresses a key limitation in most NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches: they estimate view-dependent appearance without modeling scene materials and illumination. To address this limitation, we present an inverse rendering (IR) model capable of jointly estimating scene geometry, materials, and illumination. Our model builds upon recent NeRF-based IR approaches, but crucially introduces two novel physics-based priors that better constrain the IR estimation. Our priors are rigorously formulated as intuitive loss terms and achieve state-of-the-art material estimation without compromising novel view synthesis quality. Our method is easily adaptable to other inverse rendering and 3D reconstruction frameworks that require material estimation. We demonstrate the importance of extending current neural rendering approaches to fully model scene properties beyond geometry and view-dependent appearance.

  We introduce RadA-BenchPlat, an evaluation platform that benchmarks the performance of large language models (LLMs) act as agent cores in radiology environments using 2,200 radiologist-verified synthetic patient records covering six anatomical regions, five imaging modalities, and 2,200 disease scenarios, resulting in 24,200 question-answer pairs that simulate diverse clinical situations. The platform also defines ten categories of tools for agent-driven task solving and evaluates seven leading LLMs, revealing that while models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet can achieve a 67.1% task completion rate in routine settings, they still struggle with complex task understanding and tool coordination, limiting their capacity to serve as the central core of automated radiology systems. By incorporating four advanced prompt engineering strategies--where prompt-backpropagation and multi-agent collaboration contributed 16.8% and 30.7% improvements, respectively--the performance for complex tasks was enhanced by 48.2% overall. Furthermore, automated tool building was explored to improve robustness, achieving a 65.4% success rate, thereby offering promising insights for the future integration of fully automated radiology applications into clinical practice.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multimodal language model (MLM) training approaches overlook the influence of instruction templates. Previous research deals with this problem by leveraging hand-crafted or model-generated templates, failing to investigate the scaling effect of instruction templates on MLM training. In this work, we propose a programmatic instruction template generator capable of producing over 15K unique instruction templates by filling randomly sampled positional synonyms into weighted sampled meta templates, enabling us to comprehensively explore MLM's performance across various template scales in the training process. Our investigation into scaling instruction templates for MLM training demonstrates that MLM capabilities do not consistently improve with increasing template scale. Instead, optimal performance is achieved at a medium template scale. Models trained with data augmented at the optimal template scale achieve performance gains of up to 10% over those trained on the original data and achieve the best overall performance compared with the similar-scale MLMs tuned on at most 75 times the scale of our augmented dataset. The code will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), especially in abductive reasoning and defeasible reasoning, remain poorly understood. Most benchmarks focus on typical visual scenarios, making it difficult to discern whether model performance stems from keen perception and reasoning skills, or reliance on pure statistical recall. We argue that by focusing on atypical events in videos, clearer insights can be gained on the core capabilities of VLMs. Explaining and understanding such out-of-distribution events requires models to extend beyond basic pattern recognition and regurgitation of their prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce BlackSwanSuite, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to reason about unexpected events through abductive and defeasible tasks. Our tasks artificially limit the amount of visual information provided to models while questioning them about hidden unexpected events, or provide new visual information that could change an existing hypothesis about the event. We curate a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising over 3,800 MCQ, 4,900 generative and 6,700 yes/no questions, spanning 1,655 videos. After extensively evaluating various state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source VLMs such as LLaVA-Video, we find significant performance gaps of up to 32% from humans on these tasks. Our findings reveal key limitations in current VLMs, emphasizing the need for enhanced model architectures and training strategies. Our data and leaderboard is available atthis http URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in interpreting visual content. While existing works demonstrate these models' vulnerability to deliberately placed adversarial texts, such texts are often easily identifiable as anomalous. In this paper, we present the first approach to generate scene-coherent typographic adversarial attacks that mislead advanced LVLMs while maintaining visual naturalness through the capability of the LLM-based agent. Our approach addresses three critical questions: what adversarial text to generate, where to place it within the scene, and how to integrate it seamlessly. We propose a training-free, multi-modal LLM-driven scene-coherent typographic adversarial planning (SceneTAP) that employs a three-stage process: scene understanding, adversarial planning, and seamless integration. The SceneTAP utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning to comprehend the scene, formulate effective adversarial text, strategically plan its placement, and provide detailed instructions for natural integration within the image. This is followed by a scene-coherent TextDiffuser that executes the attack using a local diffusion mechanism. We extend our method to real-world scenarios by printing and placing generated patches in physical environments, demonstrating its practical implications. Extensive experiments show that our scene-coherent adversarial text successfully misleads state-of-the-art LVLMs, including ChatGPT-4o, even after capturing new images of physical setups. Our evaluations demonstrate a significant increase in attack success rates while maintaining visual naturalness and contextual appropriateness. This work highlights vulnerabilities in current vision-language models to sophisticated, scene-coherent adversarial attacks and provides insights into potential defense mechanisms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches. Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilize backpropagation, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than text-to-image inference, or only enforce the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast and high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We observe that, during inference, we can interchange between gradient updates computed on the noisy image and updates computed on the final, clean image. This allows us to employ a numerical approximation to expensive gradient computations, incurring significant speed-ups in inference. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference approaches while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear and non-linear constraints. An implementation is provided atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data augmentation is a critical component of deep learning pipelines, enhancing model generalization by increasing dataset diversity. Traditional augmentation strategies rely on manually designed transformations, stochastic sampling, or automated search-based approaches. Although automated methods improve performance, they often require extensive computational resources and are tailored to specific datasets. In this work, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided augmentation optimization strategy that refines augmentation policies based on model performance feedback. We introduce two approaches: (1) LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where augmentation policies are selected by an LLM prior to training and iteratively refined across multiple training cycles, and (2) Adaptive LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where policies adapt in real-time based on performance metrics. This in-training approach eliminates the need for full model retraining before receiving LLM feedback, thereby reducing computational costs while improving performance. Our methodology employs an LLM to dynamically select augmentation transformations based on dataset characteristics, model architecture, and prior training outcomes. Unlike traditional search-based methods, our approach leverages the contextual knowledge of LLMs, particularly in specialized domains like medical imaging, to recommend augmentation strategies tailored to domain-specific data. We evaluate our approach on multiple domain-specific image classification datasets where augmentation is key to model robustness. Results show that LLM-guided augmentation optimization outperforms traditional methods, improving model accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in automating and adapting deep learning training workflows.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have great potential in various visual tasks due to their rich spectral information. However, obtaining high-resolution hyperspectral images remains challenging due to limitations of physical imaging. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose an efficient HSI super-resolution (HSI-SR) model to fuse a low-resolution HSI (LR-HSI) and a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI), yielding a high-resolution HSI (HR-HSI). To achieve the effective integration of spatial information from HR-MSI, we design a fusion module based on KANs, called KAN-Fusion. Further inspired by the channel attention mechanism, we design a spectral channel attention module called KAN Channel Attention Block (KAN-CAB) for post-fusion feature extraction. As a channel attention module integrated with KANs, KAN-CAB not only enhances the fine-grained adjustment ability of deep networks, enabling networks to accurately simulate details of spectral sequences and spatial textures, but also effectively avoid Curse of Dimensionality. Extensive experiments show that, compared to current state-of-the-art HSI-SR methods, proposed HSR-KAN achieves the best performance in terms of both qualitative and quantitative assessments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural implicit reconstruction via volume rendering has demonstrated its effectiveness in recovering dense 3D surfaces. However, it is non-trivial to simultaneously recover meticulous geometry and preserve smoothness across regions with differing characteristics. To address this issue, previous methods typically employ geometric priors, which are often constrained by the performance of the prior models. In this paper, we propose ND-SDF, which learns a Normal Deflection field to represent the angular deviation between the scene normal and the prior normal. Unlike previous methods that uniformly apply geometric priors on all samples, introducing significant bias in accuracy, our proposed normal deflection field dynamically learns and adapts the utilization of samples based on their specific characteristics, thereby improving both the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. Our method not only obtains smooth weakly textured regions such as walls and floors but also preserves the geometric details of complex structures. In addition, we introduce a novel ray sampling strategy based on the deflection angle to facilitate the unbiased rendering process, which significantly improves the quality and accuracy of intricate surfaces, especially on thin structures. Consistent improvements on various challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

  We present Text-driven object-centric style editing model named Style-Editor, a novel method that guides style editing at an object-centric level using textual inputs. The core of Style-Editor is our Patch-wise Co-Directional (PCD) loss, meticulously designed for precise object-centric editing that are closely aligned with the input text. This loss combines a patch directional loss for text-guided style direction and a patch distribution consistency loss for even CLIP embedding distribution across object regions. It ensures a seamless and harmonious style editing across object regions. Key to our method are the Text-Matched Patch Selection (TMPS) and Pre-fixed Region Selection (PRS) modules for identifying object locations via text, eliminating the need for segmentation masks. Lastly, we introduce an Adaptive Background Preservation (ABP) loss to maintain the original style and structural essence of the image's background. This loss is applied to dynamically identified background areas. Extensive experiments underline the effectiveness of our approach in creating visually coherent and textually aligned style editing.

The concerns are more severe when biometric data is altered through such nuanced transformations. In this work, we address the challenge of near-duplicate detection in face images by, firstly, identifying the original image from a set of near-duplicates and, secondly, deducing the relationship between the original image and the near-duplicates. We construct a tree-like structure, called an Image Phylogeny Tree (IPT) using a graph-theoretic approach to estimate the relationship, i.e., determine the sequence in which they have been generated. We further extend our method to create an ensemble of IPTs known as Image Phylogeny Forests (IPFs). We rigorously evaluate our method to demonstrate robustness across other modalities, unseen transformations by latest generative models and IPT configurations, thereby significantly advancing the state-of-the-art performance by 42% on IPF reconstruction accuracy.

  This paper addresses the problem of inverse rendering from photometric images. Existing approaches for this problem suffer from the effects of self-shadows, inter-reflections, and lack of constraints on the surface reflectance, leading to inaccurate decomposition of reflectance and illumination due to the ill-posed nature of inverse rendering. In this work, we propose a new method for neural inverse rendering. Our method jointly optimizes the light source position to account for the self-shadows in images, and computes indirect illumination using a differentiable rendering layer and an importance sampling strategy. To enhance surface reflectance decomposition, we introduce a new regularization by distilling DINO features to foster accurate and consistent material decomposition. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in reflectance decomposition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  CT image-guided thermal ablation is widely used for lung cancer treatment; however, follow-up data indicate that physicians' subjective assessments of intraoperative images often overestimate the ablation effect, potentially leading to incomplete treatment. To address these challenges, we developed \textit{Respiratory Differencing}, a novel intraoperative CT image assistance system aimed at improving ablation evaluation. The system first segments tumor regions in preoperative CT images and then employs a multi-stage registration process to align these images with corresponding intraoperative or postoperative images, compensating for respiratory deformations and treatment-induced changes. This system provides two key outputs to help physicians evaluate intraoperative ablation. First, differential images are generated by subtracting the registered preoperative images from the intraoperative ones, allowing direct visualization and quantitative comparison of pre- and post-treatment differences. These differential images enable physicians to assess the relative positions of the tumor and ablation zones, even when the tumor is no longer visible in post-ablation images, thus improving the subjective evaluation of ablation effectiveness. Second, the system provides a quantitative metric that measures the discrepancies between the tumor area and the treatment zone, offering a numerical assessment of the overall efficacy ofthis http URLpioneering system compensates for complex lung deformations and integrates pre- and intra-operative imaging data, enhancing quality control in cancer ablation treatments. A follow-up study involving 35 clinical cases demonstrated that our system significantly outperforms traditional subjective assessments in identifying under-ablation cases during or immediately after treatment, highlighting its potential to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

  _Hao Ding, Yuqian Zhang, Tuxun Lu, Ruixing Liang, Hongchao Shu, Lalithkumar Seenivasan, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Surgical data science has seen rapid advancement due to the excellent performance of end-to-end deep neural networks (DNNs) for surgical video analysis. Despite their successes, end-to-end DNNs have been proven susceptible to even minor corruptions, substantially impairing the model's performance. This vulnerability has become a major concern for the translation of cutting-edge technology, especially for high-stakes decision-making in surgical data science. We introduce SegSTRONG-C, a benchmark and challenge in surgical data science dedicated, aiming to better understand model deterioration under unforeseen but plausible non-adversarial corruption and the capabilities of contemporary methods that seek to improve it. Through comprehensive baseline experiments and participating submissions from widespread community engagement, SegSTRONG-C reveals key themes for model failure and identifies promising directions for improving robustness. The performance of challenge winners, achieving an average 0.9394 DSC and 0.9301 NSD across the unreleased test sets with corruption types: bleeding, smoke, and low brightness, shows inspiring improvement of 0.1471 DSC and 0.2584 NSD in average comparing to strongest baseline methods with UNet architecture trained with AutoAugment. In conclusion, the SegSTRONG-C challenge has identified some practical approaches for enhancing model robustness, yet most approaches relied on conventional techniques that have known, and sometimes quite severe, limitations. Looking ahead, we advocate for expanding intellectual diversity and creativity in non-adversarial robustness beyond data augmentation or training scale, calling for new paradigms that enhance universal robustness to corruptions and may enable richer applications in surgical data science.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study uses CAPM (Convex Adversarial Polytope for Maxpool-based CNN) to improve the verified bound for general purpose maxpool-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under bounded norm adversarial perturbations. The maxpool function is decomposed as a series of ReLU functions to extend the convex relaxation technique to maxpool functions, by which the verified bound can be efficiently computed through a dual network. The experimental results demonstrate that this technique allows the state-of-the-art verification precision for maxpool-based CNNs and involves a much lower computational cost than current verification methods, such as DeepZ, DeepPoly and PRIMA. This method is also applicable to large-scale CNNs, which previous studies show to be often computationally prohibitively expensive. Under certain circumstances, CAPM is 40-times, 20-times or twice as fast and give a significantly higher verification bound (CAPM 98% vs. PRIMA 76%/DeepPoly 73%/DeepZ 8%) as compared to PRIMA/DeepPoly/DeepZ. Furthermore, we additionally present the time complexity of our algorithm as $O(W^2NK)$, where $W$ is the maximum width of the neural network, $N$ is the number of neurons, and $K$ is the size of the maxpool layer's kernel.

  Existing neural head avatars methods have achieved significant progress in the image quality and motion range of portrait animation. However, these methods neglect the computational overhead, and to the best of our knowledge, none is designed to run on mobile devices. This paper presents MobilePortrait, a lightweight one-shot neural head avatars method that reduces learning complexity by integrating external knowledge into both the motion modeling and image synthesis, enabling real-time inference on mobile devices. Specifically, we introduce a mixed representation of explicit and implicit keypoints for precise motion modeling and precomputed visual features for enhanced foreground and background synthesis. With these two key designs and using simple U-Nets as backbones, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with less than one-tenth the computational demand. It has been validated to reach speeds of over 100 FPS on mobile devices and support both video and audio-driven inputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D occupancy prediction (3DOcc) is a rapidly rising and challenging perception task in the field of autonomous driving. Existing 3D occupancy networks (OccNets) are both computationally heavy and label-hungry. In terms of model complexity, OccNets are commonly composed of heavy Conv3D modules or transformers at the voxel level. Moreover, OccNets are supervised with expensive large-scale dense voxel labels. Model and data inefficiencies, caused by excessive network parameters and label annotation requirements, severely hinder the onboard deployment of OccNets. This paper proposes an EFFicient Occupancy learning framework, EFFOcc, that targets minimal network complexity and label requirements while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We first propose an efficient fusion-based OccNet that only uses simple 2D operators and improves accuracy to the state-of-the-art on three large-scale benchmarks: Occ3D-nuScenes, Occ3D-Waymo, and OpenOccupancy-nuScenes. On the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, the fusion-based model with ResNet-18 as the image backbone has 21.35M parameters and achieves 51.49 in terms of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). Furthermore, we propose a multi-stage occupancy-oriented distillation to efficiently transfer knowledge to vision-only OccNet. Extensive experiments on occupancy benchmarks show state-of-the-art precision for both fusion-based and vision-based OccNets. For the demonstration of learning with limited labels, we achieve 94.38\% of the performance (mIoU = 28.38) of a 100\% labeled vision OccNet (mIoU = 30.07) using the same OccNet trained with only 40\% labeled sequences and distillation from the fusion-based OccNet.

  _Zhe Huang, Yizhe Zhao, Hao Xiao, Chenyan Wu, Lingting Ge_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-view camera-only 3D object detection largely follows two primary paradigms: exploiting bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations or focusing on perspective-view (PV) features, each with distinct advantages. Although several recent approaches explore combining BEV and PV, many rely on partial fusion or maintain separate detection heads. In this paper, we propose DuoSpaceNet, a novel framework that fully unifies BEV and PV feature spaces within a single detection pipeline for comprehensive 3D perception. Our design includes a decoder to integrate BEV and PV features into unified detection queries, as well as a feature enhancement strategy that enriches different feature representations. In addition, DuoSpaceNet can be extended to handle multi-frame inputs, enabling more robust temporal analysis. Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset show that DuoSpaceNet surpasses both BEV-based baselines (e.g., BEVFormer) and PV-based baselines (e.g., Sparse4D) in 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation, verifying the effectiveness of our proposed design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning-based face restoration models, increasingly prevalent in smart devices, have become targets for sophisticated backdoor attacks. These attacks, through subtle trigger injection into input face images, can lead to unexpected restoration outcomes. Unlike conventional methods focused on classification tasks, our approach introduces a unique degradation objective tailored for attacking restoration models. Moreover, we propose the Adaptive Selective Frequency Injection Backdoor Attack (AS-FIBA) framework, employing a neural network for input-specific trigger generation in the frequency domain, seamlessly blending triggers with benign images. This results in imperceptible yet effective attacks, guiding restoration predictions towards subtly degraded outputs rather than conspicuous targets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the degradation objective on state-of-the-art face restoration models. Additionally, it is notable that AS-FIBA can insert effective backdoors that are more imperceptible than existing backdoor attack methods, including WaNet, ISSBA, and FIBA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end scene text spotting, which aims to read the text in natural images, has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, recent state-of-the-art methods usually incorporate detection and recognition simply by sharing the backbone, which does not directly take advantage of the feature interaction between the two tasks. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end scene text spotting framework termed SwinTextSpotter v2, which seeks to find a better synergy between text detection and recognition. Specifically, we enhance the relationship between two tasks using novel Recognition Conversion and Recognition Alignment modules. Recognition Conversion explicitly guides text localization through recognition loss, while Recognition Alignment dynamically extracts text features for recognition through the detection predictions. This simple yet effective design results in a concise framework that requires neither an additional rectification module nor character-level annotations for the arbitrarily-shaped text. Furthermore, the parameters of the detector are greatly reduced without performance degradation by introducing a Box Selection Schedule. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SwinTextSpotter v2 achieved state-of-the-art performance on various multilingual (English, Chinese, and Vietnamese) benchmarks. The code will be available at \href{this https URL}{SwinTextSpotter v2}.

  Conversational AI tools that can generate and discuss clinically correct radiology reports for a given medical image have the potential to transform radiology. Such a human-in-the-loop radiology assistant could facilitate a collaborative diagnostic process, thus saving time and improving the quality of reports. Towards this goal, we introduce RaDialog, the first thoroughly evaluated and publicly available large vision-language model for radiology report generation and interactive dialog. RaDialog effectively integrates visual image features and structured pathology findings with a large language model (LLM) while simultaneously adapting it to a specialized domain using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To keep the conversational abilities of the underlying LLM, we propose a comprehensive, semi-automatically labeled, image-grounded instruct dataset for chest X-ray radiology tasks. By training with this dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art clinical correctness in report generation and shows impressive abilities in interactive tasks such as correcting reports and answering questions, serving as a foundational step toward clinical dialog systems.

  Human facial data offers valuable potential for tackling classification problems, including face recognition, age estimation, gender identification, emotion analysis, and race classification. However, recent privacy regulations, particularly the EU General Data Protection Regulation, have restricted the collection and usage of human images in research. As a result, several previously published face data sets have been removed from the internet due to inadequate data collection methods and privacy concerns. While synthetic data sets have been suggested as an alternative, they fall short of accurately representing the real data distribution. Additionally, most existing data sets are labeled for just a single task, which limits their versatility. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-Task Face (MTF) data set, designed for various tasks, including face recognition and classification by race, gender, and age, as well as for aiding in training generative networks. The MTF data set comes in two versions: a non-curated set containing 132,816 images of 640 individuals and a manually curated set with 5,246 images of 240 individuals, meticulously selected to maximize their classification quality. Both data sets were ethically sourced, using publicly available celebrity images in full compliance with copyright regulations. Along with providing detailed descriptions of data collection and processing, we evaluated the effectiveness of the MTF data set in training five deep learning models across the aforementioned classification tasks, achieving up to 98.88\% accuracy for gender classification, 95.77\% for race classification, 97.60\% for age classification, and 79.87\% for face recognition with the ConvNeXT model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can encode complex relationships in their latent spaces, yet harnessing them for optimization under uncertainty remains challenging. We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM finetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep kernel methods. We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs to preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input space for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive uncertainty for more efficient sampling. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction optimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing reactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the top 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14% improvement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized features. Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from general chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization - demonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements across: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder), (3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4) hyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). Finally, we explain these improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood implicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce (1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration, and (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss. This work provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and insights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

  Much of the federated learning (FL) literature focuses on settings where local dataset statistics remain the same between training and testing time. Recent advances in domain generalization (DG) aim to use data from source (training) domains to train a model that generalizes well to data from unseen target (testing) domains. In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG objectives and training processes; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the conventional star-topology architecture. Addressing the second gap, we develop $\textit{Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing}$ ($\texttt{StyleDDG}$), a fully decentralized DG algorithm designed to allow devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style information inferred from their datasets. Additionally, we fill the first gap by providing the first systematic approach to mathematically analyzing style-based DG training optimization. We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and employ their formalisms to model $\texttt{StyleDDG}$. Based on this, we obtain analytical conditions under which a sub-linear convergence rate of $\texttt{StyleDDG}$ can be obtained. Through experiments on two popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that $\texttt{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across target domains with minimal added communication overhead compared to decentralized gradient methods that do not employ style sharing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Considerable progress has been made in the recent literature studies to tackle the Algorithms Selection and Parametrization (ASP) problem, which is diversified in multiple meta-learning setups. Yet there is a lack of surveys and comparative evaluations that critically analyze, summarize and assess the performance of existing methods. In this paper, we provide an overview of the state of the art in this continuously evolving field. The survey sheds light on the motivational reasons for pursuing classifiers selection through meta-learning. In this regard, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is usually treated as an ASP problem under the umbrella of the democratization of machine learning. Accordingly, AutoML makes machine learning techniques accessible to domain scientists who are interested in applying advanced analytics but lack the required expertise. It can ease the task of manually selecting ML algorithms and tuning related hyperparameters. We comprehensively discuss the different phases of classifiers selection based on a generic framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing prior works. Subsequently, we propose a benchmark knowledge base of 4 millions previously learned models and present extensive comparative evaluations of the prominent methods for classifiers selection based on 08 classification algorithms and 400 benchmark datasets. The comparative study quantitatively assesses the performance of algorithms selection methods along while emphasizing the strengths and limitations of existing studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Link prediction is a crucial graph-learning task with applications including citation prediction and product recommendation. Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hall Effect Thrusters (HETs) are electric thrusters that eject heavy ionized gas particles from the spacecraft to generate thrust. Although traditionally they were used for station keeping, recently They have been used for interplanetary space missions due to their high delta-V potential and their operational longevity in contrast to other thrusters, e.g., chemical. However, the operation of HETs involves complex processes such as ionization of gases, strong magnetic fields, and complicated solar panel power supply interactions. Therefore, their operation is extremely difficult to model thus necessitating Data Assimilation (DA) approaches for estimating and predicting their operational states. Because HET's operating environment is often noisy with non-Gaussian sources, this significantly limits applicable DA tools. We describe a topological approach for data assimilation that bypasses these limitations that does not depend on the noise model, and utilize it to forecast spatiotemporal plume field states of HETs. Our approach is a generalization of the Topological Approach for Data Assimilation (TADA) method that allows including different forecast functions. We show how TADA can be combined with the Long Short-Term Memory network for accurate forecasting. We then apply our approach to high-fidelity Hall Effect Thruster (HET) simulation data from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) rocket propulsion division where we demonstrate the forecast resiliency of TADA on noise contaminated, high-dimensional data.

  Reward modeling has emerged as a promising approach for the scalable alignment of language models. However, contemporary reward models (RMs) often lack robustness, awarding high rewards to low-quality, out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This can lead to reward hacking, where policies exploit unintended shortcuts to maximize rewards, undermining alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce Adv-RM, a novel adversarial training framework that automatically identifies adversarial examples -- responses that receive high rewards from the target RM but are OOD and of low quality. By leveraging reinforcement learning, Adv-RM trains a policy to generate adversarial examples that reliably expose vulnerabilities in large state-of-the-art reward models such as Nemotron 340B RM. Incorporating these adversarial examples into the reward training process improves the robustness of RMs, mitigating reward hacking and enhancing downstream performance in RLHF. We demonstrate that Adv-RM significantly outperforms conventional RM training, increasing stability and enabling more effective RLHF training in both synthetic and real-data settings.

  _Erik Hellsten, Carl Hvarfner, Leonard Papenmeier, Luigi Nardi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian optimization (BO ) is an effective method for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. While high-dimensional problems can be particularly challenging, due to the multitude of parameter choices and the potentially high number of data points required to fit the model, this limitation can be addressed if the problem satisfies simplifying assumptions. Axis-aligned subspace approaches, where few dimensions have a significant impact on the objective, motivated several algorithms for high-dimensional BO . However, the validity of this assumption is rarely verified, and the assumption is rarely exploited to its full extent. We propose a group testing ( GT) approach to identify active variables to facilitate efficient optimization in these domains. The proposed algorithm, Group Testing Bayesian Optimization (GTBO), first runs a testing phase where groups of variables are systematically selected and tested on whether they influence the objective, then terminates once active dimensions are identified. To that end, we extend the well-established GT theory to functions over continuous domains. In the second phase, GTBO guides optimization by placing more importance on the active dimensions. By leveraging the axis-aligned subspace assumption, GTBO outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks satisfying the assumption of axis-aligned subspaces, while offering improved interpretability.

  Accurately predicting fluid dynamics and evolution has been a long-standing challenge in physical sciences. Conventional deep learning methods often rely on the nonlinear modeling capabilities of neural networks to establish mappings between past and future states, overlooking the fluid dynamics, or only modeling the velocity field, neglecting the coupling of multiple physical quantities. In this paper, we propose a new physics-informed learning approach that incorporates coupled physical quantities into the prediction process to assist with forecasting. Central to our method lies in the discretization of physical equations, which are directly integrated into the model architecture and loss function. This integration enables the model to provide robust, long-term future predictions. By incorporating physical equations, our model demonstrates temporal extrapolation and spatial generalization capabilities. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance in spatiotemporal prediction across both numerical simulations and real-world extreme-precipitation nowcasting benchmarks.

  Enhancing energy efficiency in residential buildings is a crucial step toward mitigating climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Retrofitting existing buildings, which account for a significant portion of energy consumption, is critical particularly in regions with outdated and inefficient building stocks. This study presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)-based framework to recommend energy efficiency measures for residential buildings, leveraging accessible building characteristics to achieve energy class targets. Using Latvia as a case study, the methodology addresses challenges associated with limited datasets, class imbalance and data scarcity. The proposed approach integrates Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) to generate synthetic data, enriching and balancing the dataset. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model serves as the predictive model performing multi-label classification to predict appropriate retrofit strategies. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), ensures transparency and trust by identifying key features that influence recommendations and guiding feature engineering choices for improved reliability and performance. The evaluation of the approach shows that it notably overcomes data limitations, achieving improvements up to 54% in precision, recall and F1 score. Although this study focuses on Latvia, the methodology is adaptable to other regions, underscoring the potential of AI in reducing the complexity and cost of building energy retrofitting overcoming data limitations. By facilitating decision-making processes and promoting stakeholders engagement, this work supports the global transition toward sustainable energy use in the residential building sector.

  Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has driven many recent breakthroughs in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet, persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC (TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.

  Reliable forecasting is critical for early warning systems and adaptive drought management. Most previous deep learning approaches focus solely on homogeneous regions and rely on single-structured data. This paper presents a hybrid neural architecture that integrates time series and static data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the DroughtED dataset. Our results illustrate the potential of designing neural models for the treatment of heterogeneous data in climate related tasks and present reliable prediction of USDM categories, an expert-informed drought metric. Furthermore, this work validates the potential of DroughtED for enabling location-agnostic training of deep learning models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose CKGAN, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) variant based on an integral probability metrics framework with characteristic kernel (CKIPM). CKIPM, as a distance between two probability distributions, is designed to optimize the lowerbound of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and thus can be used to train GANs. CKGAN mitigates the notorious problem of mode collapse by mapping the generated images back to random noise. To save the effort of selecting the kernel function manually, we propose a soft selection method to automatically learn a characteristic kernel function. The experimental evaluation conducted on a set of synthetic and real image benchmarks (MNIST, CelebA, etc.) demonstrates that CKGAN generally outperforms other MMD-based GANs. The results also show that at the cost of moderately more training time, the automatically selected kernel function delivers very close performance to the best of manually fine-tuned one on real image benchmarks and is able to improve the performances of other MMD-based GANs.

  Adverse Drug Events (ADEs), harmful medication effects, pose significant healthcare challenges, impacting patient safety and costs. This study evaluates automatic Knowledge-Driven Feature Engineering (aKDFE) for improved ADE prediction from Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, comparing it with automated event-based Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). We investigated how incorporating domain-specific ADE risk scores for prolonged heart QT interval, extracted from the Janusmed Riskprofile (Janusmed) Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), affects prediction performance using EHR data and medication handling events. Results indicate that, while aKDFE step 1 (event-based feature generation) alone did not significantly improve ADE prediction performance, aKDFE step 2 (patient-centric transformation) enhances the prediction performance. High Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) values suggest strong feature correlations to the outcome, aligning with the predictive power of patients' prior healthcare history for ADEs. Statistical analysis did not confirm that incorporating the Janusmed information (i) risk scores and (ii) medication route of administration into the model's feature set enhanced predictive performance. However, the patient-centric transformation applied by aKDFE proved to be a highly effective feature engineering approach. Limitations include a single-project focus, potential bias from machine learning pipeline methods, and reliance on AUROC. In conclusion, aKDFE, particularly with patient-centric transformation, improves ADE prediction from EHR data. Future work will explore attention-based models, event feature sequences, and automatic methods for incorporating domain knowledge into the aKDFE framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Molecular property prediction is essential for applications such as drug discovery and toxicity assessment. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results by modeling molecules as molecular graphs, their reliance on data-driven learning limits their ability to generalize, particularly in the presence of data imbalance and diverse molecular substructures. Existing methods often overlook the varying contributions of different substructures to molecular properties, treating them uniformly. To address these challenges, we propose ASE-Mol, a novel GNN-based framework that leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for molecular property prediction. ASE-Mol incorporates BRICS decomposition and significant substructure awareness to dynamically identify positive and negative substructures. By integrating a MoE architecture, it reduces the adverse impact of negative motifs while improving adaptability to positive motifs. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability.

  Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms assume the distribution of the data to be uniform or mostly uniform. However, this is not the case with most real-world applications like autonomous driving or in nature where animals roam. Some experiences are encountered frequently, and most of the remaining experiences occur rarely; the resulting distribution is called Zipfian. Taking inspiration from the theory of complementary learning systems, an architecture for learning from Zipfian distributions is proposed where important long tail trajectories are discovered in an unsupervised manner. The proposal comprises an episodic memory buffer containing a prioritised memory module to ensure important rare trajectories are kept longer to address the Zipfian problem, which needs credit assignment to happen in a sample efficient manner. The experiences are then reinstated from episodic memory and given weighted importance forming the trajectory to be executed. Notably, the proposed architecture is modular, can be incorporated in any RL architecture and yields improved performance in multiple Zipfian tasks over traditional architectures. Our method outperforms IMPALA by a significant margin on all three tasks and all three evaluation metrics (Zipfian, Uniform, and Rare Accuracy) and also gives improvements on most Atari environments that are considered challenging

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The right to be forgotten is a fundamental principle of privacy-preserving regulations and extends to Machine Learning (ML) paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL). While FL enhances privacy by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data, trained models still retain the influence of training data. Federated Unlearning (FU) methods recently proposed often rely on impractical assumptions for real-world FL deployments, such as storing client update histories or requiring access to a publicly available dataset. To address these constraints, this paper introduces a novel method that leverages negated Pseudo-gradients Updates for Federated Unlearning (PUF). Our approach only uses standard client model updates, anyway employed during regular FL rounds, and interprets them as pseudo-gradients. When a client needs to be forgotten, we apply the negated of their pseudo-gradients, appropriately scaled, to the global model. Unlike state-of-the-art mechanisms, PUF seamlessly integrates with FL workflows, incurs no additional computational and communication overhead beyond standard FL rounds, and supports concurrent unlearning requests. We extensively evaluated the proposed method on two well-known benchmark image classification datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) and a real-world medical imaging dataset for segmentation (ProstateMRI), using three different neural architectures: two residual networks and a vision transformer. The experimental results across various settings demonstrate that PUF achieves state-of-the-art forgetting effectiveness and recovery time, without relying on any additional assumptions, thus underscoring its practical applicability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in challenging tasks such as mathematical reasoning, existing methods to enhance reasoning ability predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning-specific data after pre-training. However, these approaches critically depend on external supervisions--such as human labelled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models--which limits scalability and practical applicability. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (EMPO), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. EMPO does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries in a latent semantic space, EMPO enables purely self-supervised evolution of reasoning capabilities with strong flexibility and practicality. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance of EMPO on both mathematical reasoning and free-form commonsense reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, EMPO boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves truthfulness accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Instruct from 87.16\% to 97.25\% on TruthfulQA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In several practical applications, particularly healthcare, clinical data of each patient is individually recorded in a database at irregular intervals as required. This causes a sparse and irregularly sampled time series, which makes it difficult to handle as a structured representation of the prerequisites of neural network models. We therefore propose temporal dynamic embedding (TDE), which enables neural network models to receive data that change the number of variables over time. TDE regards each time series variable as an embedding vector evolving over time, instead of a conventional fixed structured representation, which causes a critical missing problem. For each time step, TDE allows for the selective adoption and aggregation of only observed variable subsets and represents the current status of patient based on current observations. The experiment was conducted on three clinical datasets: PhysioNet 2012, MIMIC-III, and PhysioNet 2019. The TDE model performed competitively or better than the imputation-based baseline and several recent state-of-the-art methods with reduced training runtime.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study proposes a method for imbalanced data classification based on deep probabilistic graphical models (DPGMs) to solve the problem that traditional methods have insufficient learning ability for minority class samples. To address the classification bias caused by class imbalance, we introduce variational inference optimization probability modeling, which enables the model to adaptively adjust the representation ability of minority classes and combines the class-aware weight adjustment strategy to enhance the classifier's sensitivity to minority classes. In addition, we combine the adversarial learning mechanism to generate minority class samples in the latent space so that the model can better characterize the category boundary in the high-dimensional feature space. The experiment is evaluated on the Kaggle "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset and compared with a variety of advanced imbalanced classification methods (such as GAN-based sampling, BRF, XGBoost-Cost Sensitive, SAAD, HAN). The results show that the method in this study has achieved the best performance in AUC, Precision, Recall and F1-score indicators, effectively improving the recognition rate of minority classes and reducing the false alarm rate. This method can be widely used in imbalanced classification tasks such as financial fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection, providing a new solution for related research.

  Graph-level clustering remains a pivotal yet formidable challenge in graph learning. Recently, the integration of deep learning with representation learning has demonstrated notable advancements, yielding performance enhancements to a certain degree. However, existing methods suffer from at least one of the following issues: 1. the original graph structure has noise, and 2. during feature propagation and pooling processes, noise is gradually aggregated into the graph-level embeddings through information propagation. Consequently, these two limitations mask clustering-friendly information, leading to suboptimal graph-level clustering performance. To this end, we propose a novel Dual Boost-Driven Graph-Level Clustering Network (DBGCN) to alternately promote graph-level clustering and filtering out interference information in a unified framework. Specifically, in the pooling step, we evaluate the contribution of features at the global and optimize them using a learnable transformation matrix to obtain high-quality graph-level representation, such that the model's reasoning capability can be improved. Moreover, to enable reliable graph-level clustering, we first identify and suppress information detrimental to clustering by evaluating similarities between graph-level representations, providing more accurate guidance for multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrated that DBGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art graph-level clustering methods on six benchmark datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research has shown that representation learning models may accidentally memorize their training data. For example, the d√©j√† vu method shows that for certain representation learning models and training images, it is sometimes possible to correctly predict the foreground label given only the representation of the background - better than through dataset-level correlations. However, their measurement method requires training two models - one to estimate dataset-level correlations and the other to estimate memorization. This multiple model setup becomes infeasible for large open-source models. In this work, we propose alternative simple methods to estimate dataset-level correlations, and show that these can be used to approximate an off-the-shelf model's memorization ability without any retraining. This enables, for the first time, the measurement of memorization in pre-trained open-source image representation and vision-language representation models. Our results show that different ways of measuring memorization yield very similar aggregate results. We also find that open-source models typically have lower aggregate memorization than similar models trained on a subset of the data. The code is available both for vision and vision language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attention mechanisms have revolutionized sequence learning but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper introduces Lattice, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) mechanism that leverages the inherent low-rank structure of K-V matrices to efficiently compress the cache into a fixed number of memory slots, achieving sub-quadratic complexity. We formulate this compression as an online optimization problem and derive a dynamic memory update rule based on a single gradient descent step. The resulting recurrence features a state- and input-dependent gating mechanism, offering an interpretable memory update process. The core innovation is the orthogonal update: each memory slot is updated exclusively with information orthogonal to its current state hence incorporation of only novel, non-redundant data, which minimizes the interference with previously stored information. The experimental results show that Lattice achieves the best perplexity compared to all baselines across diverse context lengths, with performance improvement becoming more pronounced as the context length increases.

  The last few years have witnessed rapid growth in the on-demand delivery market, with many start-ups entering the field. However, not all of these start-ups have succeeded due to various reasons, among others, not being able to establish a large enough customer base. In this paper, we address this problem that many on-demand transportation start-ups face: how to establish themselves in a new market. When starting, such companies often have limited fleet resources to serve demand across a city. Depending on the use of the fleet, varying service quality is observed in different areas of the city, and in turn, the service quality impacts the respective growth of demand in each area. Thus, operational fulfillment decisions drive the longer-term demand development. To integrate strategic demand development into real-time fulfillment operations, we propose a two-step approach. First, we derive analytical insights into optimal allocation decisions for a stylized problem. Second, we use these insights to shape the training data of a reinforcement learning strategy for operational real-time fulfillment. Our experiments demonstrate that combining operational efficiency with long-term strategic planning is highly advantageous. Further, we show that the careful shaping of training data is essential for the successful development of demand.

  Monitoring maternal and fetal health during pregnancy is crucial for preventing adverse outcomes. While tests such as ultrasound scans offer high accuracy, they can be costly and inconvenient. Telehealth and more accessible body shape information provide pregnant women with a convenient way to monitor their health. This study explores the potential of 3D body scan data, captured during the 18-24 gestational weeks, to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes and estimate clinical parameters. We developed a novel algorithm with two parallel streams which are used for extract body shape features: one for supervised learning to extract sequential abdominal circumference information, and another for unsupervised learning to extract global shape descriptors, alongside a branch for demographic data.Our results indicate that 3D body shape can assist in predicting preterm labor, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational hypertension (GH), and in estimating fetal weight. Compared to other machine learning models, our algorithm achieved the best performance, with prediction accuracies exceeding 88% and fetal weight estimation accuracy of 76.74% within a 10% error margin, outperforming conventional anthropometric methods by 22.22%.

  Intelligent agents, such as robots, are increasingly deployed in real-world, human-centric environments. To foster appropriate human trust and meet legal and ethical standards, these agents must be able to explain their behavior. However, state-of-the-art agents are typically driven by black-box models like deep neural networks, limiting their interpretability. We propose a method for generating natural language explanations of agent behavior based only on observed states and actions -- without access to the agent's underlying model. Our approach learns a locally interpretable surrogate model of the agent's behavior from observations, which then guides a large language model to generate plausible explanations with minimal hallucination. Empirical results show that our method produces explanations that are more comprehensible and correct than those from baselines, as judged by both language models and human evaluators. Furthermore, we find that participants in a user study more accurately predicted the agent's future actions when given our explanations, suggesting improved understanding of agent behavior.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning. It enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, handling noisy labels in FL remains a major challenge due to heterogeneous data distributions and communication constraints, which can severely degrade model performance. To address this issue, we propose FedEFC, a novel method designed to tackle the impact of noisy labels in FL. FedEFC mitigates this issue through two key techniques: (1) prestopping, which prevents overfitting to mislabeled data by dynamically halting training at an optimal point, and (2) loss correction, which adjusts model updates to account for label noise. In particular, we develop an effective loss correction tailored to the unique challenges of FL, including data heterogeneity and decentralized training. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis, leveraging the composite proper loss property, to demonstrate that the FL objective function under noisy label distributions can be aligned with the clean label distribution. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently outperforms existing FL techniques in mitigating the impact of noisy labels, particularly under heterogeneous data settings (e.g., achieving up to 41.64% relative performance improvement over the existing loss correction method).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting external hand load from sensor data is essential for ergonomic exposure assessments, as obtaining this information typically requires direct observation or supplementary data. While machine learning methods have been used to estimate external hand load from worker postures or force exertion data, our findings reveal systematic bias in these predictions due to individual differences such as age and biological sex. To explore this issue, we examined bias in hand load prediction by varying the sex ratio in the training dataset. We found substantial sex disparity in predictive performance, especially when the training dataset is more sex-imbalanced. To address this bias, we developed and evaluated a fair predictive model for hand load estimation that leverages a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with feature disentanglement. This approach is designed to separate sex-agnostic and sex-specific latent features, minimizing feature overlap. The disentanglement capability enables the model to make predictions based solely on sex-agnostic features of motion patterns, ensuring fair prediction for both biological sexes. Our proposed fair algorithm outperformed conventional machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forests) in both fairness and predictive accuracy, achieving a lower mean absolute error (MAE) difference across male and female sets and improved fairness metrics such as statistical parity (SP) and positive and negative residual differences (PRD and NRD), even when trained on imbalanced sex datasets. These findings emphasize the importance of fairness-aware machine learning algorithms to prevent potential disadvantages in workplace health and safety for certain worker populations.

  Controlling instabilities in complex dynamical systems is challenging in scientific and engineering applications. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has seen promising results for applications in different scientific applications. The many-query nature of control tasks requires multiple interactions with real environments of the underlying physics. However, it is usually sparse to collect from the experiments or expensive to simulate for complex dynamics. Alternatively, controlling surrogate modeling could mitigate the computational cost issue. However, a fast and accurate learning-based model by offline training makes it very hard to get accurate pointwise dynamics when the dynamics are chaotic. To bridge this gap, the current work proposes a multi-fidelity reinforcement learning (MFRL) framework that leverages differentiable hybrid models for control tasks, where a physics-based hybrid model is corrected by limited high-fidelity data. We also proposed a spectrum-based reward function for RL learning. The effect of the proposed framework is demonstrated on two complex dynamics in physics. The statistics of the MFRL control result match that computed from many-query evaluations of the high-fidelity environments and outperform other SOTA baselines.

  Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has shown promise in scaling up the learning capacity of neural networks. However, vanilla SMoEs have issues such as expert redundancy and heavy memory requirements, making them inefficient and non-scalable, especially for resource-constrained scenarios. Expert-level sparsification of SMoEs involves pruning the least important experts to address these limitations. In this work, we aim to address three questions: (1) What is the best recipe to identify the least knowledgeable subset of experts that can be dropped with minimal impact on performance? (2) How should we perform expert dropping (one-shot or iterative), and what correction measures can we undertake to minimize its drastic impact on SMoE subnetwork capabilities? (3) What capabilities of full-SMoEs are severely impacted by the removal of the least dominant experts, and how can we recover them? Firstly, we propose MoE Experts Compression Suite (MC-Suite), which is a collection of some previously explored and multiple novel recipes to provide a comprehensive benchmark for estimating expert importance from diverse perspectives, as well as unveil numerous valuable insights for SMoE experts. Secondly, unlike prior works with a one-shot expert pruning approach, we explore the benefits of iterative pruning with the re-estimation of the MC-Suite criterion. Moreover, we introduce the benefits of task-agnostic fine-tuning as a correction mechanism during iterative expert dropping, which we term MoE Lottery Subnetworks. Lastly, we present an experimentally validated conjecture that, during expert dropping, SMoEs' instruction-following capabilities are predominantly hurt, which can be restored to a robust level subject to external augmentation of instruction-following capabilities using k-shot examples and supervised fine-tuning.

  Episodic tasks in Reinforcement Learning (RL) often pose challenges due to sparse reward signals and high-dimensional state spaces, which hinder efficient learning. Additionally, these tasks often feature hidden "trap states" -- irreversible failures that prevent task completion but do not provide explicit negative rewards to guide agents away from repeated errors. To address these issues, we propose Time-Weighted Contrastive Reward Learning (TW-CRL), an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that leverages both successful and failed demonstrations. By incorporating temporal information, TW-CRL learns a dense reward function that identifies critical states associated with success or failure. This approach not only enables agents to avoid trap states but also encourages meaningful exploration beyond simple imitation of expert trajectories. Empirical evaluations on navigation tasks and robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that TW-CRL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved efficiency and robustness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC), enabling multiple intersections to coordinate signal timings in real time. However, in large-scale settings, MARL faces constraints due to extensive data sharing and communication requirements. Federated learning (FL) mitigates these challenges by training shared models without directly exchanging raw data, yet traditional FL methods such as FedAvg struggle with highly heterogeneous intersections. Different intersections exhibit varying traffic patterns, demands, and road structures, so performing FedAvg across all agents is inefficient. To address this gap, we propose Hierarchical Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) for ATSC. HFRL employs clustering-based or optimization-based techniques to dynamically group intersections and perform FedAvg independently within groups of intersections with similar characteristics, enabling more effective coordination and scalability than standard FedAvg. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world traffic networks demonstrate that HFRL not only outperforms both decentralized and standard federated RL approaches but also identifies suitable grouping patterns based on network structure or traffic demand, resulting in a more robust framework for distributed, heterogeneous systems.

  Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has shown great potential for enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it is often sample- and compute-inefficient, requiring extensive training. In this work, we introduce AdaRFT (Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Finetuning), a method that significantly improves both the efficiency and final accuracy of RFT through adaptive curriculum learning. AdaRFT dynamically adjusts the difficulty of training problems based on the model's recent reward signals, ensuring that the model consistently trains on tasks that are challenging but solvable. This adaptive sampling strategy accelerates learning by maintaining an optimal difficulty range, avoiding wasted computation on problems that are too easy or too hard. AdaRFT requires only a lightweight extension to standard RFT algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), without modifying the reward function or model architecture. Experiments on competition-level math datasets-including AMC, AIME, and IMO-style problems-demonstrate that AdaRFT significantly improves both training efficiency and reasoning performance. We evaluate AdaRFT across multiple data distributions and model sizes, showing that it reduces the number of training steps by up to 2x and improves accuracy by a considerable margin, offering a more scalable and effective RFT framework.

  Climate change is increasing the occurrence of extreme precipitation events, threatening infrastructure, agriculture, and public safety. Ensemble prediction systems provide probabilistic forecasts but exhibit biases and difficulties in capturing extreme weather. While post-processing techniques aim to enhance forecast accuracy, they rarely focus on precipitation, which exhibits complex spatial dependencies and tail behavior. Our novel framework leverages graph neural networks to post-process ensemble forecasts, specifically modeling the extremes of the underlying distribution. This allows to capture spatial dependencies and improves forecast accuracy for extreme events, thus leading to more reliable forecasts and mitigating risks of extreme precipitation and flooding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep classifiers are known to be sensitive to data distribution shifts, primarily due to their reliance on spurious correlations in training data. It has been suggested that these classifiers can still find useful features in the network's last layer that hold up under such shifts. In this work, we question the use of last-layer representations for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and explore the utility of intermediate layers. To this end, we introduce \textit{Intermediate Layer Classifiers} (ILCs). We discover that intermediate layer representations frequently offer substantially better generalisation than those from the penultimate layer. In many cases, zero-shot OOD generalisation using earlier-layer representations approaches the few-shot performance of retraining on penultimate layer representations. This is confirmed across multiple datasets, architectures, and types of distribution shifts. Our analysis suggests that intermediate layers are less sensitive to distribution shifts compared to the penultimate layer. These findings highlight the importance of understanding how information is distributed across network layers and its role in OOD generalisation, while also pointing to the limits of penultimate layer representation utility.

  _Benny Skidanov, Daniel Erbesfeld, Gera Weiss, Achiya Elyasaf_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting player behavior in strategic games, especially complex ones like chess, presents a significant challenge. The difficulty arises from several factors. First, the sheer number of potential outcomes stemming from even a single position, starting from the initial setup, makes forecasting a player's next move incredibly complex. Second, and perhaps even more challenging, is the inherent unpredictability of human behavior. Unlike the optimized play of engines, humans introduce a layer of variability due to differing playing styles and decision-making processes. Each player approaches the game with a unique blend of strategic thinking, tactical awareness, and psychological tendencies, leading to diverse and often unexpected actions. This stylistic variation, combined with the capacity for creativity and even irrational moves, makes predicting human play difficult. Chess, a longstanding benchmark of artificial intelligence research, has seen significant advancements in tools and automation. Engines like Deep Blue, AlphaZero, and Stockfish can defeat even the most skilled human players. However, despite their exceptional ability to outplay top-level grandmasters, predicting the moves of non-grandmaster players, who comprise most of the global chess community -- remains complicated for these engines. This paper proposes a novel approach combining expert knowledge with machine learning techniques to predict human players' next moves. By applying feature engineering grounded in domain expertise, we seek to uncover the patterns in the moves of intermediate-level chess players, particularly during the opening phase of the game. Our methodology offers a promising framework for anticipating human behavior, advancing both the fields of AI and human-computer interaction.

  Adverse weather conditions, particularly convective phenomena, pose significant challenges to Air Traffic Management, often requiring real-time rerouting decisions that impact efficiency and safety. This study introduces a 3-D Gaussian Mixture Model to predict long lead-time flight trajectory changes, incorporating comprehensive weather and traffic data. Utilizing high-resolution meteorological datasets, including convective weather maps and wind data, alongside traffic records, the model demonstrates robust performance in forecasting reroutes up to 60 minutes. The novel 3-D Gaussian Mixture Model framework employs a probabilistic approach to capture uncertainty while providing accurate forecasts of altitude, latitude, and longitude. Extensive evaluation revealed a Mean Absolute Percentage Error below 0.02 across varying lead times, highlighting the model's accuracy and scalability. By integrating explainability techniques such as the Vanilla Gradient algorithm, the study provides insights into feature contributions, showing that they contribute to improving Air Traffic Management strategies to mitigate weather-induced disruptions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits the existence of a sparse subnetwork (a.k.a. winning ticket) that can generalize comparably to its over-parameterized counterpart when trained from scratch. The common approach to finding a winning ticket is to preserve the original strong generalization through Iterative Pruning (IP) and transfer information useful for achieving the learned generalization by applying the resulting sparse mask to an untrained network. However, existing IP methods still struggle to generalize their observations beyond ad-hoc initialization and small-scale architectures or datasets, or they bypass these challenges by applying their mask to trained weights instead of initialized ones. In this paper, we demonstrate that the parameter sign configuration plays a crucial role in conveying useful information for generalization to any randomly initialized network. Through linear mode connectivity analysis, we observe that a sparse network trained by an existing IP method can retain its basin of attraction if its parameter signs and normalization layer parameters are preserved. To take a step closer to finding a winning ticket, we alleviate the reliance on normalization layer parameters by preventing high error barriers along the linear path between the sparse network trained by our method and its counterpart with initialized normalization layer parameters. Interestingly, across various architectures and datasets, we observe that any randomly initialized network can be optimized to exhibit low error barriers along the linear path to the sparse network trained by our method by inheriting its sparsity and parameter sign information, potentially achieving performance comparable to the original.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.

  _Siqing Song, Chuang Wang, Ruiqi Wang, Yi Yang, Xuyao Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantizing large language models (LLMs) to 1-bit precision significantly reduces computational costs, but existing quantization techniques suffer from noticeable performance degradation when using weight and activation precisions below 4 bits (W4A4). In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework with W(1+1)A(1*4) configuration, where weights are quantized to 1 bit with an additional 1 bit for fine-grain grouping and activations are quantized to 1 bit with a 4-fold increase in the number of channels. For weight quantization, we propose utilizing Hessian-aware fine-grained grouping along with an EM-based quantization scheme. For activation quantization, we decompose INT4-quantized activations into a 4 * INT1 format equivalently and simultaneously smooth the scaling factors based on quantization errors, which further reduces the quantization errors in activations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM quantization baselines on W2A4 across multiple tasks, pushing the boundaries of existing LLM quantization methods toward fully binarized models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are predominantly tailored for graphs displaying homophily, where similar nodes connect, but often fail on heterophilic graphs. The strategy of adopting distinct approaches to learn from homophilic and heterophilic components in node-level tasks has been widely discussed and proven effective both theoretically and experimentally. However, in graph-level tasks, research on this topic remains notably scarce. Addressing this gap, our research conducts an analysis on graphs with nodes' category ID available, distinguishing intra-category and inter-category components as embodiment of homophily and heterophily, respectively. We find while GCNs excel at extracting information within categories, they frequently capture noise from inter-category components. Consequently, it is crucial to employ distinct learning strategies for intra- and inter-category elements. To alleviate this problem, we separately learn the intra- and inter-category parts by a combination of an intra-category convolution (IntraNet) and an inter-category high-pass graph convolution (InterNet). Our IntraNet is supported by sophisticated graph preprocessing steps and a novel category-based graph readout function. For the InterNet, we utilize a high-pass filter to amplify the node disparities, enhancing the recognition of details in the high-frequency components. The proposed approach, DivGNN, combines the IntraNet and InterNet with a gated mechanism and substantially improves classification performance on graph-level tasks, surpassing traditional GNN baselines in effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models continue to grow in size, parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become increasingly crucial. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a solution through low-rank updates, its static rank allocation may yield suboptimal results. Adaptive low-rank adaptation (AdaLoRA) improves this with dynamic allocation but remains sensitive to initial and target rank configurations. We introduce AROMA, a framework that automatically constructs layer-specific updates by iteratively building up rank-one components with very few trainable parameters that gradually diminish to zero. Unlike existing methods that employ rank reduction mechanisms, AROMA introduces a dual-loop architecture for rank growth. The inner loop extracts information from each rank-one subspace, while the outer loop determines the number of rank-one subspaces, i.e., the optimal rank. We reset optimizer states to maintain subspace independence. AROMA significantly reduces parameters compared to LoRA and AdaLoRA while achieving superior performance on natural language understanding and commonsense reasoning tasks, offering new insights into adaptive parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model merging has recently emerged as a lightweight alternative to ensembling, combining multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of parameters with no additional training overhead. Yet, existing merging methods fall short of matching the full accuracy of separately fine-tuned endpoints. We present MASS (MoErging through Adaptive Subspace Selection), a new approach that closes this gap by unifying multiple fine-tuned models while retaining near state-of-the-art performance across tasks. Building on the low-rank decomposition of per-task updates, MASS stores only the most salient singular components for each task and merges them into a shared model. At inference time, a non-parametric, data-free router identifies which subspace (or combination thereof) best explains an input's intermediate features and activates the corresponding task-specific block. This procedure is fully training-free and introduces only a two-pass inference overhead plus a ~2 storage factor compared to a single pretrained model, irrespective of the number of tasks. We evaluate MASS on CLIP-based image classification using ViT-B-16, ViT-B-32 and ViT-L-14 for benchmarks of 8, 14 and 20 tasks respectively, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Most notably, MASS recovers up to ~98% of the average accuracy of individual fine-tuned models, making it a practical alternative to ensembling at a fraction of the storage cost.

  _Farida Mohsen, Zubair Shah_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) remains a global health challenge, underscoring the need for early and accurate risk prediction. This study presents ECG-DiaNet, a multimodal deep learning model that integrates electrocardiogram (ECG) features with clinical risk factors (CRFs) to enhance T2DM onset prediction. Using data from Qatar Biobank (QBB), we trained and validated models on a development cohort (n=2043) and evaluated performance on a longitudinal test set (n=395) with five-year follow-up. ECG-DiaNet outperformed unimodal ECG-only and CRF-only models, achieving a higher AUROC (0.845 vs 0.8217) than the CRF-only model, with statistical significance (DeLong p<0.001). Reclassification metrics further confirmed improvements: Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI=0.0153) and Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI=0.0482). Risk stratification into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups showed ECG-DiaNet achieved superior positive predictive value (PPV) in high-risk individuals. The model's reliance on non-invasive and widely available ECG signals supports its feasibility in clinical and community health settings. By combining cardiac electrophysiology and systemic risk profiles, ECG-DiaNet addresses the multifactorial nature of T2DM and supports precision prevention. These findings highlight the value of multimodal AI in advancing early detection and prevention strategies for T2DM, particularly in underrepresented Middle Eastern populations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Expressive range analysis is a visualization-based technique used to evaluate the performance of generative models, particularly in game level generation. It typically employs two quantifiable metrics to position generated artifacts on a 2D plot, offering insight into how content is distributed within a defined metric space. In this work, we use the expressive range of a generator as the conceptual space of possible creations. Inspired by the quality diversity paradigm, we explore this space to generate levels. To do so, we use a constraint-based generator that systematically traverses and generates levels in this space. To train the constraint-based generator we use different tile patterns to learn from the initial example levels. We analyze how different patterns influence the exploration of the expressive range. Specifically, we compare the exploration process based on time, the number of successful and failed sample generations, and the overall interestingness of the generated levels. Unlike typical quality diversity approaches that rely on random generation and hope to get good coverage of the expressive range, this approach systematically traverses the grid ensuring more coverage. This helps create unique and interesting game levels while also improving our understanding of the generator's strengths and limitations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent task allocation (MATA) plays a vital role in cooperative multi-agent systems, with significant implications for applications such as logistics, search and rescue, and robotic coordination. Although traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising, their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward functions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have been the predominant generative model for tabular data generation. However, they face the conundrum of modeling under a separate versus a unified data representation. The former encounters the challenge of jointly modeling all multi-modal distributions of tabular data in one model. While the latter alleviates this by learning a single representation for all features, it currently leverages sparse suboptimal encoding heuristics and necessitates additional computation costs. In this work, we address the latter by presenting TabRep, a tabular diffusion architecture trained with a unified continuous representation. To motivate the design of our representation, we provide geometric insights into how the data manifold affects diffusion models. The key attributes of our representation are composed of its density, flexibility to provide ample separability for nominal features, and ability to preserve intrinsic relationships. Ultimately, TabRep provides a simple yet effective approach for training tabular diffusion models under a continuous data manifold. Our results showcase that TabRep achieves superior performance across a broad suite of evaluations. It is the first to synthesize tabular data that exceeds the downstream quality of the original datasets while preserving privacy and remaining computationally efficient.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly contributing to the creation of content on the Internet. This creates a feedback loop as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this generated, synthetic data. This phenomenon is receiving increasing interest, in particular because previous studies have shown that it may lead to distribution shift - models misrepresent and forget the true underlying distributions of human data they are expected to approximate (e.g. resulting in a drastic loss of quality). In this study, we study the impact of human data properties on distribution shift dynamics in iterated training loops. We first confirm that the distribution shift dynamics greatly vary depending on the human data by comparing four datasets (two based on Twitter and two on Reddit). We then test whether data quality may influence the rate of this shift. We find that it does on the twitter, but not on the Reddit datasets. We then focus on a Reddit dataset and conduct a more exhaustive evaluation of a large set of dataset properties. This experiment associated lexical diversity with larger, and semantic diversity with smaller detrimental shifts, suggesting that incorporating text with high lexical (but limited semantic) diversity could exacerbate the degradation of generated text. We then focus on the evolution of political bias, and find that the type of shift observed (bias reduction, amplification or inversion) depends on the political lean of the human (true) distribution. Overall, our work extends the existing literature on the consequences of recursive fine-tuning by showing that this phenomenon is highly dependent on features of the human data on which training occurs. This suggests that different parts of internet (e.g. GitHub, Reddit) may undergo different types of shift depending on their properties.

  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an automated technique to design optimal neural network architectures for a specific workload. Conventionally, evaluating candidate networks in NAS involves extensive training, which requires significant time and computational resources. To address this, training-free NAS has been proposed to expedite network evaluation with minimal search time. However, state-of-the-art training-free NAS algorithms struggle to precisely distinguish well-performing networks from poorly-performing networks, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions and consequently sub-optimal top-1 network accuracy. Moreover, they are less effective in activation function exploration. To tackle the challenges, this paper proposes RBFleX-NAS, a novel training-free NAS framework that accounts for both activation outputs and input features of the last layer with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. We also present a detection algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters using the obtained activation outputs and input feature maps. We verify the efficacy of RBFleX-NAS over a variety of NAS benchmarks. RBFleX-NAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art training-free NAS methods in terms of top-1 accuracy, achieving this with short search time in NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-SSS. In addition, it demonstrates higher Kendall correlation compared to layer-based training-free NAS algorithms. Furthermore, we propose NAFBee, a new activation design space that extends the activation type to encompass various commonly used functions. In this extended design space, RBFleX-NAS demonstrates its superiority by accurately identifying the best-performing network during activation function search, providing a significant advantage over other NAS algorithms.

  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical technique for training large language models. However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed uncertain reward model to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that directly model the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the reward distribution uncertainty calculation based on Bhattacharyya Coefficient. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. We propose a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of PURM. Experiments demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final reward performance, outperforming baseline methods in both stability and effectiveness.

  In this study, we examine the reliability of AI-based Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) and large language models (LLMs) in providing objective political information. Our analysis is based upon a comparison with party responses to 38 statements of the Wahl-O-Mat, a well-established German online tool that helps inform voters by comparing their views with political party positions. For the LLMs, we identify significant biases. They exhibit a strong alignment (over 75% on average) with left-wing parties and a substantially lower alignment with center-right (smaller 50%) and right-wing parties (around 30%). Furthermore, for the VAAs, intended to objectively inform voters, we found substantial deviations from the parties' stated positions in Wahl-O-Mat: While one VAA deviated in 25% of cases, another VAA showed deviations in more than 50% of cases. For the latter, we even observed that simple prompt injections led to severe hallucinations, including false claims such as non-existent connections between political parties and right-wing extremist ties.

  Birth weight serves as a fundamental indicator of neonatal health, closely linked to both early medical interventions and long-term developmental risks. Traditional predictive models, often constrained by limited feature selection and incomplete datasets, struggle to achieve overlooking complex maternal and fetal interactions in diverse clinical settings. This research explores machine learning to address these limitations, utilizing a structured methodology that integrates advanced imputation strategies, supervised feature selection techniques, and predictive modeling. Given the constraints of the dataset, the research strengthens the role of data preprocessing in improving the model performance. Among the various methodologies explored, tree-based feature selection methods demonstrated superior capability in identifying the most relevant predictors, while ensemble-based regression models proved highly effective in capturing non-linear relationships and complex maternal-fetal interactions within the data. Beyond model performance, the study highlights the clinical significance of key physiological determinants, offering insights into maternal and fetal health factors that influence birth weight, offering insights that extend over statistical modeling. By bridging computational intelligence with perinatal research, this work underscores the transformative role of machine learning in enhancing predictive accuracy, refining risk assessment and informing data-driven decision-making in maternal and neonatal care.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The foundation model has heralded a new era in artificial intelligence, pretraining a single model to offer cross-domain transferability on different datasets. Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.

  _Adam Scherlis, Nora Belrose_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present and analyze an algorithm for estimating the size, under a Gaussian or uniform measure, of a localized neighborhood in neural network parameter space with behavior similar to an ``anchor'' point. We refer to this as the "local volume" of the anchor. We adapt an existing basin-volume estimator, which is very fast but in many cases only provides a lower bound. We show that this lower bound can be improved with an importance-sampling method using gradient information that is already provided by popular optimizers. The negative logarithm of local volume can also be interpreted as a measure of the anchor network's information content. As expected for a measure of complexity, this quantity increases during language model training. We find that overfit, badly-generalizing neighborhoods are smaller, indicating a more complex learned behavior. This smaller volume can also be interpreted in an MDL sense as suboptimal compression. Our results are consistent with a picture of generalization we call the "volume hypothesis": that neural net training produces good generalization primarily because the architecture gives simple functions more volume in parameter space, and the optimizer samples from the low-loss manifold in a volume-sensitive way. We believe that fast local-volume estimators are a promising practical metric of network complexity and architectural inductive bias for interpretability purposes.

  Regression analysis is used for prediction and to understand the effect of independent variables on dependent variables. Symbolic regression (SR) automates the search for non-linear regression models, delivering a set of hypotheses that balances accuracy with the possibility to understand the phenomena. Many SR implementations return a Pareto front allowing the choice of the best trade-off. However, this hides alternatives that are close to non-domination, limiting these choices. Equality graphs (e-graphs) allow to represent large sets of expressions compactly by efficiently handling duplicated parts occurring in multiple expressions. E-graphs allow to store and query all SR solution candidates visited in one or multiple GP runs efficiently and open the possibility to analyse much larger sets of SR solution candidates. We introduce rEGGression, a tool using e-graphs to enable the exploration of a large set of symbolic expressions which provides querying, filtering, and pattern matching features creating an interactive experience to gain insights about SR models. The main highlight is its focus in the exploration of the building blocks found during the search that can help the experts to find insights about the studiedthis http URLis possible by exploiting the pattern matching capability of the e-graph data structure.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The search for symbolic regression models with genetic programming (GP) has a tendency of revisiting expressions in their original or equivalent forms. Repeatedly evaluating equivalent expressions is inefficient, as it does not immediately lead to better solutions. However, evolutionary algorithms require diversity and should allow the accumulation of inactive building blocks that can play an important role at a later point. The equality graph is a data structure capable of compactly storing expressions and their equivalent forms allowing an efficient verification of whether an expression has been visited in any of their stored equivalent forms. We exploit the e-graph to adapt the subtree operators to reduce the chances of revisiting expressions. Our adaptation, called eggp, stores every visited expression in the e-graph, allowing us to filter out from the available selection of subtrees all the combinations that would create already visited expressions. Results show that, for small expressions, this approach improves the performance of a simple GP algorithm to compete with PySR and Operon without increasing computational cost. As a highlight, eggp was capable of reliably delivering short and at the same time accurate models for a selected set of benchmarks from SRBench and a set of real-world datasets.

  Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) seeks to enhance data efficiency by learning a model of the environment and generating synthetic rollouts from it. However, accumulated model errors during these rollouts can distort the data distribution, negatively impacting policy learning and hindering long-term planning. Thus, the accumulation of model errors is a key bottleneck in current MBRL methods. We propose Infoprop, a model-based rollout mechanism that separates aleatoric from epistemic model uncertainty and reduces the influence of the latter on the data distribution. Further, Infoprop keeps track of accumulated model errors along a model rollout and provides termination criteria to limit data corruption. We demonstrate the capabilities of Infoprop in the Infoprop-Dyna algorithm, reporting state-of-the-art performance in Dyna-style MBRL on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks while substantially increasing rollout length and data quality.

  Convex functions and their gradients play a critical role in mathematical imaging, from proximal optimization to Optimal Transport. The successes of deep learning has led many to use learning-based methods, where fixed functions or operators are replaced by learned neural networks. Regardless of their empirical superiority, establishing rigorous guarantees for these methods often requires to impose structural constraints on neural architectures, in particular convexity. The most popular way to do so is to use so-called Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs). In order to explore the expressivity of ICNNs, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a ReLU neural network to be convex. Such characterizations are based on product of weights and activations, and write nicely for any architecture in the path-lifting framework. As particular applications, we study our characterizations in depth for 1 and 2-hidden-layer neural networks: we show that every convex function implemented by a 1-hidden-layer ReLU network can be also expressed by an ICNN with the same architecture; however this property no longer holds with more layers. Finally, we provide a numerical procedure that allows an exact check of convexity for ReLU neural networks with a large number of affine regions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, allowing models to solve complex tasks stepwise. However, training CoT capabilities requires detailed reasoning data, which is often scarce. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) framework addresses this by using reinforcement learning to automatically generate reasoning steps, reducing reliance on human-labeled data. Although STaR and its variants have demonstrated empirical success, a theoretical foundation explaining these improvements is lacking. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical capabilities, largely driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes complex reasoning into step-by-step solutions. However, the mechanisms underlying LLMs' ability to perform arithmetic in a single step of CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose that LLMs learn arithmetic by capturing algebraic structures, such as commutativity and identity properties. Since these structures are observable through input-output relationships, they can generalize to unseen data. We empirically demonstrate that LLMs can learn algebraic structures using a custom dataset of arithmetic problems, as well as providing theoretical evidence showing that, under specific configurations of weights and biases, the transformer-based LLMs can generate embeddings that remain invariant to both permutations of input tokens and the presence of identity elements. Our findings indicate that leveraging algebraic structures can enhance the LLMs' arithmetic capabilities, offering insights into improving their arithmetic performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that utilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar SSL method and a contrastive learning-based SSL method. Additionally, PFML is on par with the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.

  General movements (GMs) are spontaneous, coordinated body movements in infants that offer valuable insights into the developing nervous system. Assessed through the Prechtl GM Assessment (GMA), GMs are reliable predictors for neurodevelopmental disorders. However, GMA requires specifically trained clinicians, who are limited in number. To scale up newborn screening, there is a need for an algorithm that can automatically classify GMs from infant video recordings. This data poses challenges, including variability in recording length, device type, and setting, with each video coarsely annotated for overall movement quality. In this work, we introduce a tool for extracting features from these recordings and explore various machine learning techniques for automated GM classification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data selection can reduce the amount of training data needed to finetune LLMs; however, the efficacy of data selection scales directly with its compute. Motivated by the practical challenge of compute-constrained finetuning, we consider the setting in which both the cost of selecting data and training are budgeted for. We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. For compute-optimal training, we find that perplexity and gradient data selection require training-to-selection model size ratios of 5x and 10x, respectively.

  Recent advances in state-space model architectures have shown great promise for efficient sequence modeling, but challenges remain in balancing computational efficiency with model expressiveness. We propose the Flash STU architecture, a hybrid model that interleaves spectral state space model layers with sliding window attention, enabling scalability to billions of parameters for language modeling while maintaining a near-linear time complexity. We evaluate the Flash STU and its variants on diverse sequence prediction tasks, including linear dynamical systems, robotics control, and language modeling. We find that, given a fixed parameter budget, the Flash STU architecture consistently outperforms the Transformer and other leading state-space models such as S4 and Mamba-2.

  Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease, with knee OA (KOA) being one of the leading causes of disability and a significant economic burden. Predicting KOA progression is crucial for improving patient outcomes, optimizing healthcare resources, studying the disease, and developing new treatments. The latter application particularly requires one to understand the disease progression in order to collect the most informative data at the right time. Existing methods, however, are limited by their static nature and their focus on individual joints, leading to suboptimal predictive performance and downstream utility. Our study proposes a new method that allows to dynamically monitor patients rather than individual joints with KOA using a novel Active Sensing (AS) approach powered by Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our key idea is to directly optimize for the downstream task by training an agent that maximizes informative data collection while minimizing overall costs. Our RL-based method leverages a specially designed reward function to monitor disease progression across multiple body parts, employs multimodal deep learning, and requires no human input during testing. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art models, paving the way for the next generation of KOA trials.

  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has recently excelled in solving challenging cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in various environments, typically involving a small number of agents and full observability. Moreover, a range of crucial robotics-related tasks, such as multi-robot pathfinding, which have traditionally been approached with classical non-learnable methods (e.g., heuristic search), are now being suggested for solution using learning-based or hybrid methods. However, in this domain, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to conduct a fair comparison between classical, learning-based, and hybrid approaches due to the lack of a unified framework that supports both learning and evaluation. To address this, we introduce POGEMA, a comprehensive set of tools that includes a fast environment for learning, a problem instance generator, a collection of predefined problem instances, a visualization toolkit, and a benchmarking tool for automated evaluation. We also introduce and define an evaluation protocol that specifies a range of domain-related metrics, computed based on primary evaluation indicators (such as success rate and path length), enabling a fair multi-fold comparison. The results of this comparison, which involves a variety of state-of-the-art MARL, search-based, and hybrid methods, are presented.

  In many situations, the measurements of a studied phenomenon are provided sequentially, and the prediction of its class needs to be made as early as possible so as not to incur too high a time penalty, but not too early and risk paying the cost of misclassification. This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (seethis https URL).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extensive research efforts have been put into characterizing and constructing maximally separating multiset and graph neural networks. However, recent empirical evidence suggests the notion of separation itself doesn't capture several interesting phenomena. On the one hand, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of "separable" objects might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. On the other hand, architectures which aren't capable of separation in theory, somehow achieve separation when taking the network to be wide enough.In this work, we address both of these issues, by proposing a novel pair-wise separation quality analysis framework which is based on an adaptation of Lipschitz and \Holder{} stability to parametric functions. The proposed framework, which we name \emph{\Holder{} in expectation}, allows for separation quality analysis, without restricting the analysis to embeddings that can separate all the input space simultaneously. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-\Holder{} in expectation, with an exponentthat decays rapidly with the network's depth . Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz in expectation. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks.

  To create useful reinforcement learning (RL) agents, step zero is to design a suitable reward function that captures the nuances of the task. However, reward engineering can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Instead, human-in-the-loop RL methods hold the promise of learning reward functions from human feedback. Despite recent successes, many of the human-in-the-loop RL methods still require numerous human interactions to learn successful reward functions. To improve the feedback efficiency of human-in-the-loop RL methods (i.e., require less human interaction), this paper introduces Sub-optimal Data Pre-training, SDP, an approach that leverages reward-free, sub-optimal data to improve scalar- and preference-based RL algorithms. In SDP, we start by pseudo-labeling all low-quality data with the minimum environment reward. Through this process, we obtain reward labels to pre-train our reward model without requiring human labeling or preferences. This pre-training phase provides the reward model a head start in learning, enabling it to recognize that low-quality transitions should be assigned low rewards. Through extensive experiments with both simulated and human teachers, we find that SDP can at least meet, but often significantly improve, state of the art human-in-the-loop RL performance across a variety of simulated robotic tasks.

  Given the high computational cost of preference alignment training of large language models (LLMs), exploring efficient methods to reduce the training overhead remains an important and compelling research problem. Motivated by the observation that alignment training typically involves only small parameter changes without injecting new knowledge into models, we propose a straightforward method called ExPO (model extrapolation) to expedite LLMs' alignment with human preferences. Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one. Moreover, we show that ExPO notably improves existing open-source LLMs (ranging from 1.8B to 70B parameters) on the leading AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench benchmarks, which highlights ExPO's broader utility in efficiently enhancing LLM alignment.

  Deep learning (e.g., Transformer) has been widely and successfully used in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). Unlike existing methods that focus on training models from a single modal of time series input, large language models (LLMs) based MTSF methods with cross-modal text and time series input have recently shown great superiority, especially with limited temporal data. However, current LLM-based MTSF methods usually focus on adapting and fine-tuning LLMs, while neglecting the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal input tokens, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal LLM Fine-Tuning (CALF) framework for MTSF by reducing the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal data, which mainly consists of the temporal target branch with temporal input and the textual source branch with aligned textual input. To reduce the distribution discrepancy, we develop the cross-modal match module to first align cross-modal input distributions. Additionally, to minimize the modality distribution gap in both feature and output spaces, feature regularization loss is developed to align the intermediate features between the two branches for better weight updates, while output consistency loss is introduced to allow the output representations of both branches to correspond effectively. Thanks to the modality alignment, CALF establishes state-of-the-art performance for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with low computational complexity, and exhibiting favorable few-shot and zero-shot abilities similar to that in LLMs. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Reducing a graph while preserving its overall properties is an important problem with many applications. Typically, reduction approaches either remove edges (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream task in an end-to-end fashion without requiring a differentiable loss function for the task. We showcase the versatility of our approach on four distinct applications: image segmentation, explainability for graph classification, 3D shape sparsification, and sparse approximate matrix inverse determination.

  Recently, Ainsworth et al. showed that using weight matching (WM) to minimize the $L^2$ distance in a permutation search of model parameters effectively identifies permutations that satisfy linear mode connectivity (LMC), where the loss along a linear path between two independently trained models with different seeds remains nearly constant. This paper analyzes LMC using WM, which is useful for understanding stochastic gradient descent's effectiveness and its application in areas like model merging. We first empirically show that permutations found by WM do not significantly reduce the $L^2$ distance between two models, and the occurrence of LMC is not merely due to distance reduction by WM itself. We then demonstrate that permutations can change the directions of the singular vectors, but not the singular values, of the weight matrices in each layer. This finding shows that permutations found by WM primarily align the directions of singular vectors associated with large singular values across models. This alignment brings the singular vectors with large singular values, which determine the model's functionality, closer between the original and merged models, allowing the merged model to retain functionality similar to the original models, thereby satisfying LMC. This paper also analyzes activation matching (AM) in terms of singular vectors and finds that the principle of AM is likely the same as that of WM. Finally, we analyze the difference between WM and the straight-through estimator (STE), a dataset-dependent permutation search method, and show that WM can be more advantageous than STE in achieving LMC among three or more models.

  In the last decade, zero-cost metrics have gained prominence in neural architecture search (NAS) due to their ability to evaluate architectures without training. These metrics are significantly faster and less computationally expensive than traditional NAS methods and provide insights into neural architectures' internal workings. This paper introduces epsinas, a novel zero-cost NAS metric that assesses architecture potential using two constant shared weight initialisations and the statistics of their outputs. We show that the dispersion of raw outputs, normalised by their average magnitude, strongly correlates with trained accuracy. This effect holds across image classification and language tasks on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and NAS-Bench-NLP. Our method requires no data labels, operates on a single minibatch, and eliminates the need for gradient computation, making it independent of training hyperparameters, loss metrics, and human annotations. It evaluates a network in a fraction of a GPU second and integrates seamlessly into existing NAS frameworks. The code supporting this study can be found on GitHub atthis https URL.

  Deep learning-based multivariate and multistep-ahead traffic forecasting models are typically trained with the mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) as the loss function in a sequence-to-sequence setting, simply assuming that the errors follow an independent and isotropic Gaussian or Laplacian distributions. However, such assumptions are often unrealistic for real-world traffic forecasting tasks, where the probabilistic distribution of spatiotemporal forecasting is very complex with strong concurrent correlations across both sensors and forecasting horizons in a time-varying manner. In this paper, we model the time-varying distribution for the matrix-variate error process as a dynamic mixture of zero-mean Gaussian distributions. To achieve efficiency, flexibility, and scalability, we parameterize each mixture component using a matrix normal distribution and allow the mixture weight to change and be predictable over time. The proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into existing deep-learning frameworks with only a few additional parameters to be learned. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a traffic speed forecasting task and find that our method not only improves model performance but also provides interpretable spatiotemporal correlation structures.

  Due to the rapid growth of IoT and artificial intelligence, deploying neural networks on IoT devices is becoming increasingly crucial for edge intelligence. Federated learning (FL) facilitates the management of edge devices to collaboratively train a shared model while maintaining training data local and private. However, a general assumption in FL is that all edge devices are trained on the same machine learning model, which may be impractical considering diverse device capabilities. For instance, less capable devices may slow down the updating process because they struggle to handle large models appropriate for ordinary devices. In this paper, we propose a novel data-free FL method that supports heterogeneous client models by managing features and logits, called Felo; and its extension with a conditional VAE deployed in the server, called Velo. Felo averages the mid-level features and logits from the clients at the server based on their class labels to provide the average features and logits, which are utilized for further training the client models. Unlike Felo, the server has a conditional VAE in Velo, which is used for training mid-level features and generating synthetic features according to the labels. The clients optimize their models based on the synthetic features and the average logits. We conduct experiments on two datasets and show satisfactory performances of our methods compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

  The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with completeness guarantees require planning full horizon paths. However, planning full horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world applications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the planner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more practical for real world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time planning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or deadlock. Our main contribution is to show the first Real-Time MAPF method with provable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM (Okumura 2023) in an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for congested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still maintaining the same success rate as full horizon LaCAM. We also show how it can be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy. The proposed Real-Time LaCAM also provides us with a general mechanism for using iterative constraints for completeness in future real-time MAPF algorithms.

  The use of AI in legal analysis and prediction (LegalAI) has gained widespread attention, with past research focusing on retrieval-based methods and fine-tuning large models. However, these approaches often require large datasets and underutilize the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs). In this paper, inspired by the debate phase of real courtroom trials, we propose a novel legal judgment prediction model based on the Debate-Feedback architecture, which integrates LLM multi-agent debate and reliability evaluation models. Unlike traditional methods, our model achieves significant improvements in efficiency by minimizing the need for large historical datasets, thus offering a lightweight yet robust solution. Comparative experiments show that it outperforms several general-purpose and domain-specific legal models, offering a dynamic reasoning process and a promising direction for future LegalAI research.

  The card game Hanabi is considered a strong medium for the testing and development of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, due to its cooperative nature, hidden information, limited communication and remarkable complexity. Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of ``rules''. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting the action space using conventions, which act as special cooperative actions that span over multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play across a various number of cooperators within Hanabi.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a problem that generally requires finding collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment. Solving MAPF optimally, even under restrictive assumptions, is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions for this problem are critical for numerous applications, such as automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Typically, such learning-based MAPF solvers are augmented with additional components like single-agent planning or communication. Orthogonally, in this work we rely solely on imitation learning that leverages a large dataset of expert MAPF solutions and transformer-based neural network to create a foundation model for MAPF called MAPF-GPT. The latter is capable of generating actions without additional heuristics or communication. MAPF-GPT demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problems that are not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is computationally efficient during inference.

  The increasing complexity of underwater robotic systems has led to a surge in simulation platforms designed to support perception, planning, and control tasks in marine environments. However, selecting the most appropriate underwater robotic simulator (URS) remains a challenge due to wide variations in fidelity, extensibility, and task suitability. This paper presents a comprehensive review and comparative analysis of five state-of-the-art, ROS-compatible, open-source URSs: Stonefish, DAVE, HoloOcean, MARUS, and UNav-Sim. Each simulator is evaluated across multiple criteria including sensor fidelity, environmental realism, sim-to-real capabilities, and research impact. We evaluate them across architectural design, sensor and physics modeling, task capabilities, and research impact. Additionally, we discuss ongoing challenges in sim-to-real transfer and highlight the need for standardization and benchmarking in the field. Our findings aim to guide practitioners in selecting effective simulation environments and inform future development of more robust and transferable URSs.

  Tactile information plays a crucial role for humans and robots to interact effectively with their environment, particularly for tasks requiring the understanding of contact properties. Solving such dexterous manipulation tasks often relies on imitation learning from demonstration datasets, which are typically collected via teleoperation systems and often demand substantial time and effort. To address these challenges, we present ViTaMIn, an embodiment-free manipulation interface that seamlessly integrates visual and tactile sensing into a hand-held gripper, enabling data collection without the need for teleoperation. Our design employs a compliant Fin Ray gripper with tactile sensing, allowing operators to perceive force feedback during manipulation for more intuitive operation. Additionally, we propose a multimodal representation learning strategy to obtain pre-trained tactile representations, improving data efficiency and policy robustness. Experiments on seven contact-rich manipulation tasks demonstrate that ViTaMIn significantly outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex manipulation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Path planning algorithms, such as the search-based A*, are a critical component of autonomous mobile robotics, enabling robots to navigate from a starting point to a destination efficiently and safely. We investigated the resilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial interventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversary's goal is to delay the robot's timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its original path.We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation, the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36\%, with the most significant delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially longer alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing measurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithm's robustness is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the operational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels, the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative routes.

  _Benjamin A. Christie, Dylan P. Losey_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety is critical during human-robot interaction. But -- because people are inherently unpredictable -- it is often difficult for robots to plan safe behaviors. Instead of relying on our ability to anticipate humans, here we identify robot policies that are robust to unexpected human decisions. We achieve this by formulating human-robot interaction as a zero-sum game, where (in the worst case) the human's actions directly conflict with the robot's objective. Solving for the Nash Equilibrium of this game provides robot policies that maximize safety and performance across a wide range of human actions. Existing approaches attempt to find these optimal policies by leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi analysis (which is intractable) or linear-quadratic approximations (which are inexact). By contrast, in this work we propose a computationally efficient and theoretically justified method that converges towards the Nash Equilibrium policy. Our approach (which we call MCLQ) leverages linear-quadratic games to obtain an initial guess at safe robot behavior, and then iteratively refines that guess with a Monte Carlo search. Not only does MCLQ provide real-time safety adjustments, but it also enables the designer to tune how conservative the robot is -- preventing the system from focusing on unrealistic human behaviors. Our simulations and user study suggest that this approach advances safety in terms of both computation time and expected performance. See videos of our experiments here:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precise vehicle state estimation is crucial for safe and reliable autonomous driving. The number of measurable states and their precision offered by the onboard vehicle sensor system are often constrained by cost. For instance, measuring critical quantities such as the Vehicle Sideslip Angle (VSA) poses significant commercial challenges using current optical sensors. This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on the development of high-performance virtual sensors to enhance vehicle state estimation for active safety. The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Learning (UAHL) architecture integrates a machine learning model with vehicle motion models to estimate VSA directly from onboard sensor data. A key aspect of the UAHL architecture is its focus on uncertainty quantification for individual model estimates and hybrid fusion. These mechanisms enable the dynamic weighting of uncertainty-aware predictions from machine learning and vehicle motion models to produce accurate and reliable hybrid VSA estimates. This work also presents a novel dataset named Real-world Vehicle State Estimation Dataset (ReV-StED), comprising synchronized measurements from advanced vehicle dynamic sensors. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method for VSA estimation, highlighting UAHL as a promising architecture for advancing virtual sensors and enhancing active safety in autonomous vehicles.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale egocentric video datasets capture diverse human activities across a wide range of scenarios, offering rich and detailed insights into how humans interact with objects, especially those that require fine-grained dexterous control. Such complex, dexterous skills with precise controls are crucial for many robotic manipulation tasks, yet are often insufficiently addressed by traditional data-driven approaches to robotic manipulation. To address this gap, we leverage manipulation priors learned from large-scale egocentric video datasets to improve policy learning for dexterous robotic manipulation tasks. We present MAPLE, a novel method for dexterous robotic manipulation that exploits rich manipulation priors to enable efficient policy learning and better performance on diverse, complex manipulation tasks. Specifically, we predict hand-object contact points and detailed hand poses at the moment of hand-object contact and use the learned features to train policies for downstream manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPLE across existing simulation benchmarks, as well as a newly designed set of challenging simulation tasks, which require fine-grained object control and complex dexterous skills. The benefits of MAPLE are further highlighted in real-world experiments using a dexterous robotic hand, whereas simultaneous evaluation across both simulation and real-world experiments has remained underexplored in prior work.

  _Haoming Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents research findings on handling faulty measurements (i.e., outliers) of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for robot localization under adverse signal conditions in field applications, where raw GNSS data are frequently corrupted due to environmental interference such as multipath, signal blockage, or non-line-of-sight conditions. In this context, we investigate three strategies applied specifically to GNSS pseudorange observations: robust statistics for error mitigation, machine learning for faulty measurement prediction, and Bayesian inference for noise distribution approximation. Since previous studies have provided limited insight into the theoretical foundations and practical evaluations of these three methodologies within a unified problem statement (i.e., state estimation using ranging sensors), we conduct extensive experiments using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Our goal is to examine both established techniques and newly proposed methods, thereby advancing the understanding of how to handle faulty range measurements, such as GNSS, for robust, long-term robot localization. In addition to presenting successful results, this work highlights critical observations and open questions to motivate future research in robust state estimation.

  _Huazhi Dong, Xiaopeng Wu, Delin Hu, Zhe Liu, Francesco Giorgio-Serchi, Yunjie Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)-based tactile sensors offer cost-effective and scalable solutions for robotic sensing, especially promising for soft robots. However a major issue of EIT-based tactile sensors when applied in highly deformable objects is their performance degradation due to surface deformations. This limitation stems from their inherent sensitivity to strain, which is particularly exacerbated in soft bodies, thus requiring dedicated data interpretation to disentangle the parameter being measured and the signal deriving from shape changes. This has largely limited their practical implementations. This paper presents a machine learning-assisted tactile sensing approach to address this challenge by tracking surface deformations and segregating this contribution in the signal readout during tactile sensing. We first capture the deformations of the target object, followed by tactile reconstruction using a deep learning model specifically designed to process and fuse EIT data and deformation information. Validations using numerical simulations achieved high correlation coefficients (0.9660 - 0.9999), peak signal-to-noise ratios (28.7221 - 55.5264 dB) and low relative image errors (0.0107 - 0.0805). Experimental validations, using a hydrogel-based EIT e-skin under various deformation scenarios, further demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-world settings. The findings could underpin enhanced tactile interaction in soft and highly deformable robotic applications.

  _Yang Wang, Hai Yu, Shizhen Wu, Zhichao Yang, Jianda Han, Yongchun Fang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The unmanned aerial manipulator system, consisting of a multirotor UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and a manipulator, has attracted considerable interest from researchers. Nevertheless, the operation of a dual-arm manipulator poses a dynamic challenge, as the CoM (center of mass) of the system changes with manipulator movement, potentially impacting the multirotor UAV. Additionally, unmodeled effects, parameter uncertainties, and external disturbances can significantly degrade control performance, leading to unforeseen dangers. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a nonlinear adaptive RISE (robust integral of the sign of the error) controller based on DNN (deep neural network). The first step involves establishing the kinematic and dynamic model of the dual-arm aerial manipulator. Subsequently, the adaptive RISE controller is proposed with a DNN feedforward term to effectively address both internal and external challenges. By employing Lyapunov techniques, the asymptotic convergence of the tracking error signals are guaranteed rigorously. Notably, this paper marks a pioneering effort by presenting the first DNN-based adaptive RISE controller design accompanied by a comprehensive stability analysis. To validate the practicality and robustness of the proposed control approach, several groups of actual hardware experiments are conducted. The results confirm the efficacy of the developed methodology in handling real-world scenarios, thereby offering valuable insights into the performance of the dual-arm aerial manipulator system.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the increasing demand for human-computer interaction (HCI), flexible wearable gloves have emerged as a promising solution in virtual reality, medical rehabilitation, and industrial automation. However, the current technology still has problems like insufficient sensitivity and limited durability, which hinder its wide application. This paper presents a highly sensitive, modular, and flexible capacitive sensor based on line-shaped electrodes and liquid metal (EGaIn), integrated into a sensor module tailored to the human hand's anatomy. The proposed system independently captures bending information from each finger joint, while additional measurements between adjacent fingers enable the recording of subtle variations in inter-finger spacing. This design enables accurate gesture recognition and dynamic hand morphological reconstruction of complex movements using point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our classifier based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieves an accuracy of 99.15% across 30 gestures. Meanwhile, a transformer-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) accurately reconstructs dynamic hand shapes with an Average Distance (AD) of 2.076\pm3.231 mm, with the reconstruction accuracy at individual key points surpassing SOTA benchmarks by 9.7% to 64.9%. The proposed glove shows excellent accuracy, robustness and scalability in gesture recognition and hand reconstruction, making it a promising solution for next-generation HCI systems.

  _Amit Kumar Singh, Prasanth Kumar Duba, P. Rajalakshmi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Autonomy of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in indoor environments poses significant challenges due to the lack of reliable GPS signals in enclosed spaces such as warehouses, factories, and indoor facilities. Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are preferred for navigating in these complex, GPS-denied scenarios because of their agility, low power consumption, and limited computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning based Deep-Proximal Policy Optimization (D-PPO) algorithm to enhance realtime navigation through improving the computation efficiency. The end-to-end network is trained in 3D realistic meta-environments created using the Unreal Engine. With these trained meta-weights, the MAV system underwent extensive experimental trials in real-world indoor environments. The results indicate that the proposed method reduces computational latency by 91\% during training period without significant degradation in performance. The algorithm was tested on a DJI Tello drone, yielding similar results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work proposes a coverage controller that enables an aerial team of distributed autonomous agents to collaboratively generate non-myopic coverage plans over a rolling finite horizon, aiming to cover specific points on the surface area of a 3D object of interest. The collaborative coverage problem, formulated, as a distributed model predictive control problem, optimizes the agents' motion and camera control inputs, while considering inter-agent constraints aiming at reducing work redundancy. The proposed coverage controller integrates constraints based on light-path propagation techniques to predict the parts of the object's surface that are visible with regard to the agents' future anticipated states. This work also demonstrates how complex, non-linear visibility assessment constraints can be converted into logical expressions that are embedded as binary constraints into a mixed-integer optimization framework. The proposed approach has been demonstrated through simulations and practical applications for inspecting buildings with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous driving systems must operate safely in human-populated indoor environments, where challenges such as limited perception and occlusion sensitivity arise when relying solely on onboard sensors. These factors generate difficulties in the accurate recognition of human intentions and the generation of comfortable, socially aware trajectories. To address these issues, we propose SAP-CoPE, a social-aware planning framework that integrates cooperative infrastructure with a novel 3D human pose estimation method and a model predictive control-based controller. This real-time framework formulates an optimization problem that accounts for uncertainty propagation in the camera projection matrix while ensuring human joint coherence. The proposed method is adaptable to single- or multi-camera configurations and can incorporate sparse LiDAR point-cloud data. To enhance safety and comfort in human environments, we integrate a human personal space field based on human pose into a model predictive controller, enabling the system to navigate while avoiding discomfort zones. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating socially aware trajectories for autonomous systems.

  _Jinseong Park, Jeong-Jung Kim, Doo-Yeol Koh_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present asymmetric pivot manipulation for picking up rigid hollow objects to achieve a hole grasp. The pivot motion, executed by a position-controlled robotic arm, enables the gripper to effectively grasp hollow objects placed horizontally such that one gripper finger is positioned inside the object's hole, while the other contacts its outer surface along the length. Hole grasp is widely employed by humans to manipulate hollow objects, facilitating precise placement and enabling efficient subsequent operations, such as tightly packing objects into trays or accurately inserting them into narrow machine slots in manufacturing processes. Asymmetric pivoting for hole grasping is applicable to hollow objects of various sizes and hole shapes, including bottles, cups, and ducts. We investigate the variable parameters that satisfy the force balance conditions for successful grasping configurations. Our method can be implemented using a commercially available parallel-jaw gripper installed directly on a robot arm without modification. Experimental verification confirmed that hole grasp can be achieved using our proposed asymmetric pivot manipulation for various hollow objects, demonstrating a high success rate. Two use cases, namely aligning and feeding hollow cylindrical objects, were experimentally demonstrated on the testbed to clearly showcase the advantages of the hole grasp approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the field of legged robot motion control, reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise but faces two major challenges: high computational cost for training individual robots and poor generalization of trained models. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called Prior Transfer Reinforcement Learning (PTRL), which improves both training efficiency and model transferability across different robots. Drawing inspiration from model transfer techniques in deep learning, PTRL introduces a fine-tuning mechanism that selectively freezes layers of the policy network during transfer, making it the first to apply such a method in RL. The framework consists of three stages: pre-training on a source robot using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, transferring the learned policy to a target robot, and fine-tuning with partial network freezing. Extensive experiments on various robot platforms confirm that this approach significantly reduces training time while maintaining or even improving performance. Moreover, the study quantitatively analyzes how the ratio of frozen layers affects transfer results, providing valuable insights into optimizing the process. The experimental outcomes show that PTRL achieves better walking control performance and demonstrates strong generalization and adaptability, offering a promising solution for efficient and scalable RL-based control of legged robots.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Lazy-DaSH, an improvement over the recent state of the art multi-robot task and motion planning method DaSH, which scales to more than double the number of robots and objects compared to the original method and achieves an order of magnitude faster planning time when applied to a multi-manipulator object rearrangement problem. We achieve this improvement through a hierarchical approach, where a high-level task planning layer identifies planning spaces required for task completion, and motion feasibility is validated lazily only within these spaces. In contrast, DaSH precomputes the motion feasibility of all possible actions, resulting in higher costs for constructing state space representations. Lazy-DaSH maintains efficient query performance by utilizing a constraint feedback mechanism within its hierarchical structure, ensuring that motion feasibility is effectively conveyed to the query process. By maintaining smaller state space representations, our method significantly reduces both representation construction time and query time. We evaluate Lazy-DaSH in four distinct scenarios, demonstrating its scalability to increasing numbers of robots and objects, as well as its adaptability in resolving conflicts through the constraint feedback mechanism.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One approach to using prior experience in robot motion planning is to store solutions to previously seen problems in a database of paths. Methods that use such databases are characterized by how they query for a path and how they use queries given a new problem. In this work we present a new method, Path Database Guidance (PDG), which innovates on existing work in two ways. First, we use the database to compute a heuristic for determining which nodes of a search tree to expand, in contrast to prior work which generally pastes the (possibly transformed) queried path or uses it to bias a sampling distribution. We demonstrate that this makes our method more easily composable with other search methods by dynamically interleaving exploration according to a baseline algorithm with exploitation of the database guidance. Second, in contrast to other methods that treat the database as a single fixed prior, our database (and thus our queried heuristic) updates as we search the implicitly defined robot configuration space. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of PDG in a variety of explicitly defined environment distributions in simulation.

  Robot teleoperation enables human control over robotic systems in environments where full autonomy is challenging. Recent advancements in low-cost teleoperation devices and VR/AR technologies have expanded accessibility, particularly for bimanual robot manipulators. However, transitioning from in-person to remote teleoperation presents challenges in task performance. We introduce SPARK, a kinematically scaled, low-cost teleoperation system for operating bimanual robots. Its effectiveness is compared to existing technologies like the 3D SpaceMouse and VR/AR controllers. We further extend SPARK to SPARK-Remote, integrating sensor-based force feedback using haptic gloves and a force controller for remote teleoperation. We evaluate SPARK and SPARK-Remote variants on 5 bimanual manipulation tasks which feature operational properties - positional precision, rotational precision, large movements in the workspace, and bimanual collaboration - to test the effective teleoperation modes. Our findings offer insights into improving low-cost teleoperation interfaces for real-world applications.

  Efficient scheduling remains a critical challenge in various domains, requiring solutions to complex NP-hard optimization problems to achieve optimal resource allocation and maximize productivity. In this paper, we introduce a framework called Transformer-Based Task Scheduling System (TRATSS), designed to address the intricacies of single agent scheduling in graph-based environments. By integrating the latest advancements in reinforcement learning and transformer architecture, TRATSS provides a novel system that outputs optimized task scheduling decisions while dynamically adapting to evolving task requirements and resource availability. Leveraging the self-attention mechanism in transformers, TRATSS effectively captures complex task dependencies, thereby providing solutions with enhanced resource utilization and task completion efficiency. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate TRATSS's effectiveness in providing high-quality solutions to scheduling problems that involve multiple action profiles.

  _Siqian Li, Jung-Che Chang, Xi Wang, Xin Dong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, miniature wall-climbing robots have attracted widespread attention due to their significant potential in equipment inspection and in-situ repair applications. Traditional wall-climbing systems typically rely on electromagnetic, electrostatic, vacuum suction, or van der Waals forces for controllable adhesion. However, these conventional methods impose limitations when striving for both a compact design and high-speed mobility. This paper proposes a novel Vibration-Based Adhesion (VBA) technique, which utilizes a flexible disk vibrating near a surface to generate a strong and controllable attractive force without direct contact. By employing an electric motor as the vibration source, the constructed VBA system was experimentally evaluated, achieving an adhesion-to-weight ratio exceeding 51 times. The experimental results demonstrate that this adhesion mechanism not only provides a high normal force but also maintains minimal shear force, making it particularly suitable for high-speed movement and heavy load applications in miniature wall-climbing robots.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of the logistics industry, the path planning of logistics vehicles has become increasingly complex, requiring consideration of multiple constraints such as time windows, task sequencing, and motion smoothness. Traditional path planning methods often struggle to balance these competing demands efficiently. In this paper, we propose a path planning technique based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to address these challenges. The proposed method optimizes key performance metrics, including path length, task completion time, turning counts, and motion smoothness, to ensure efficient and practical route planning for logistics vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that the ACO-based approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of both efficiency and adaptability. This study provides a robust solution for logistics vehicle path planning, offering significant potential for real-world applications in dynamic and constrained environments.

  Robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) holds considerable promise for elevating precision and safety in cardiovascular procedures. Nevertheless, current systems heavily depend on human operators, resulting in variability and the potential for human error. To tackle these challenges, Sim4EndoR, an innovative reinforcement learning (RL) based simulation environment, is first introduced to bolster task-level autonomy in PCI. This platform offers a comprehensive and risk-free environment for the development, evaluation, and refinement of potential autonomous systems, enhancing data collection efficiency and minimizing the need for costly hardware trials. A notable aspect of the groundbreaking Sim4EndoR is its reward function, which takes into account the anatomical constraints of the vascular environment, utilizing the geometric characteristics of vessels to steer the learning process. By seamlessly integrating advanced physical simulations with neural network-driven policy learning, Sim4EndoR fosters efficient sim-to-real translation, paving the way for safer, more consistent robotic interventions in clinical practice, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

  Billions of vascular access procedures are performed annually worldwide, serving as a crucial first step in various clinical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. For pediatric or elderly individuals, whose vessels are small in size (typically 2 to 3 mm in diameter for adults and less than 1 mm in children), vascular access can be highly challenging. This study presents an image-guided robotic system aimed at enhancing the accuracy of difficult vascular access procedures. The system integrates a 6-DoF robotic arm with a 3-DoF end-effector, ensuring precise navigation and needle insertion. Multi-modal imaging and sensing technologies have been utilized to endow the medical robot with precision and safety, while ultrasound imaging guidance is specifically evaluated in this study. To evaluate in vivo vascular access in submillimeter vessels, we conducted ultrasound-guided robotic blood drawing on the tail veins (with a diameter of 0.7 plus or minus 0.2 mm) of 40 rats. The results demonstrate that the system achieved a first-attempt success rate of 95 percent. The high first-attempt success rate in intravenous vascular access, even with small blood vessels, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in performing these procedures. This capability reduces the risk of failed attempts, minimizes patient discomfort, and enhances clinical efficiency.

  Self-handover, transferring an object between one's own hands, is a common but understudied bimanual action. While it facilitates seamless transitions in complex tasks, the strategies underlying its execution remain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of self-handover, derived from manual annotation of over 12 hours of cooking activity performed by 21 participants. Our analysis reveals that self-handover is not merely a passive transition, but a highly coordinated action involving anticipatory adjustments by both hands. As a step toward automated analysis of human manipulation, we further demonstrate the feasibility of classifying self-handover types using a state-of-the-art vision-language model. These findings offer fresh insights into bimanual coordination, underscoring the role of self-handover in enabling smooth task transitions-an ability essential for adaptive dual-arm robotics.

  Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) aim to improve traffic safety and efficiency by reducing human error. However, ensuring AVs reliability and safety is a challenging task when rare, high-risk traffic scenarios are considered. These 'Corner Cases' (CC) scenarios, such as unexpected vehicle maneuvers or sudden pedestrian crossings, must be safely and reliable dealt by AVs during their operations. But they arehard to be efficiently generated. Traditional CC generation relies on costly and risky real-world data acquisition, limiting scalability, and slowing research and development progress. Simulation-based techniques also face challenges, as modeling diverse scenarios and capturing all possible CCs is complex and time-consuming. To address these limitations in CC generation, this research introduces CORTEX-AVD, CORner Case Testing & EXploration for Autonomous Vehicles Development, an open-source framework that integrates the CARLA Simulator and Scenic to automatically generate CC from textual descriptions, increasing the diversity and automation of scenario modeling. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used to optimize the scenario parameters in six case study scenarios, increasing the occurrence of high-risk events. Unlike previous methods, CORTEX-AVD incorporates a multi-factor fitness function that considers variables such as distance, time, speed, and collision likelihood. Additionally, the study provides a benchmark for comparing GA-based CC generation methods, contributing to a more standardized evaluation of synthetic data generation and scenario assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the CORTEX-AVD framework significantly increases CC incidence while reducing the proportion of wasted simulations.

  Considering the widespread integration of aerial robots in inspection, search and rescue, and monitoring tasks, there is a growing demand to design intuitive human-drone interfaces. These aim to streamline and enhance the user interaction and collaboration process during drone navigation, ultimately expediting mission success and accommodating users' inputs. In this paper, we present a novel human-drone mixed reality interface that aims to (a) increase human-drone spatial awareness by sharing relevant spatial information and representations between the human equipped with a Head Mounted Display (HMD) and the robot and (b) enable safer and intuitive human-drone interactive and collaborative navigation in unknown environments beyond the simple command and control or teleoperation paradigm. We validate our framework through extensive user studies and experiments in a simulated post-disaster scenario, comparing its performance against a traditional First-Person View (FPV) control systems. Furthermore, multiple tests on several users underscore the advantages of the proposed solution, which offers intuitive and natural interaction with the system. This demonstrates the solution's ability to assist humans during a drone navigation mission, ensuring its safe and effective execution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Addressing the inherent low acquisition frequency limitation of 3D LiDAR to achieve high-frequency output has become a critical research focus in the LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) domain. To ensure real-time performance, frequency-enhanced LIO systems must process each sweep within significantly reduced timeframe, which presents substantial challenges for deployment on low-computational-power platforms. To address these limitations, we introduce SR-LIO++, an innovative LIO system capable of achieving doubled output frequency relative to input frequency on resource-constrained hardware platforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our system employs a sweep reconstruction methodology to enhance LiDAR sweep frequency, generating high-frequency reconstructed sweeps. Building upon this foundation, we propose a caching mechanism for intermediate results (i.e., surface parameters) of the most recent segments, effectively minimizing redundant processing of common segments in adjacent reconstructed sweeps. This method decouples processing time from the traditionally linear dependence on reconstructed sweep frequency. Furthermore, we present a quantized map point management based on index table mapping, significantly reducing memory usage by converting global 3D point storage from 64-bit double precision to 8-bit char representation. This method also converts the computationally intensive Euclidean distance calculations in nearest neighbor searches from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit short and 32-bit integer formats, significantly reducing both memory and computational cost. Extensive experimental evaluations across three distinct computing platforms and four public datasets demonstrate that SR-LIO++ maintains state-of-the-art accuracy while substantially enhancing efficiency. Notably, our system successfully achieves 20Hz state output on Raspberry Pi 4B hardware.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotic control, including drones, has the potential to revolutionize autonomous systems. Research studies have demonstrated that LLMs can be leveraged to support robotic operations. However, when facing tasks with complex reasoning, concerns and challenges are raised about the reliability of solutions produced by LLMs. In this paper, we propose a prompt framework with enhanced reasoning to enable reliable LLM-driven control for drones. Our framework consists of novel technical components designed using Guidelines, Skill APIs, Constraints, and Examples, namely GSCE. GSCE is featured by its reliable and constraint-compliant code generation. We performed thorough experiments using GSCE for the control of drones with a wide level of task complexities. Our experiment results demonstrate that GSCE can significantly improve task success rates and completeness compared to baseline approaches, highlighting its potential for reliable LLM-driven autonomous drone systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotics applications often rely on scene reconstructions to enable downstream tasks. In this work, we tackle the challenge of actively building an accurate map of an unknown scene using an RGB-D camera on a mobile platform. We propose a hybrid map representation that combines a Gaussian splatting map with a coarse voxel map, leveraging the strengths of both representations: the high-fidelity scene reconstruction capabilities of Gaussian splatting and the spatial modelling strengths of the voxel map. At the core of our framework is an effective confidence modelling technique for the Gaussian splatting map to identify under-reconstructed areas, while utilising spatial information from the voxel map to target unexplored areas and assist in collision-free path planning. By actively collecting scene information in under-reconstructed and unexplored areas for map updates, our approach achieves superior Gaussian splatting reconstruction results compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate the real-world applicability of our framework using an unmanned aerial vehicle.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tractor-trailer wheeled robots need to perform comprehensive perception tasks to enhance their operations in areas such as logistics parks and long-haul transportation. The perception of these robots faces three major challenges: the asynchronous vibrations between the tractor and trailer, the relative pose change between the tractor and trailer, and the significant camera parallax caused by the large size. In this paper, we employ the Dual Independence Stabilization Motion Field Estimation method to address asynchronous vibrations between the tractor and trailer, effectively eliminating conflicting motion estimations for the same object in overlapping regions. We utilize the Random Plane-based Stitching Motion Field Estimation method to tackle the continuous relative pose changes caused by the articulated hitch between the tractor and trailer, thus eliminating dynamic misalignment in overlapping regions. Furthermore, we apply the Unified Vertex Motion Estimation method to manage the challenges posed by the tractor-trailer's large physical size, which results in severely low overlapping regions between the tractor and trailer views, thus preventing distortions in overlapping regions from exponentially propagating into non-overlapping areas. Furthermore, this framework has been successfully implemented in real tractor-trailer wheeled robots. The proposed Unified Vertex Motion Video Stabilization and Stitching method has been thoroughly tested in various challenging scenarios, demonstrating its accuracy and practicality in real-world.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Different from most of the formation strategies where robots require unique labels to identify topological neighbors to satisfy the predefined shape constraints, we here study the problem of identity-less distributed shape formation in homogeneous swarms, which is rarely studied in the literature. The absence of identities creates a unique challenge: how to design appropriate target formations and local behaviors that are suitable for identity-less formation shape control. To address this challenge, we propose the following novel results. First, to avoid using unique identities, we propose a dynamic formation description method and solve the formation consensus of robots in a locally distributed manner. Second, to handle identity-less distributed formations, we propose a fully distributed control law for homogeneous swarms based on locally sensed information. While the existing methods are applicable to simple cases where the target formation is stationary, ours can tackle more general maneuvering formations such as translation, rotation, or even shape deformation. Both numerical simulation and flight experiment are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed formation strategy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot learning approaches such as behavior cloning and reinforcement learning have shown great promise in synthesizing robot skills from human demonstrations in specific environments. However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for unseen real-world settings. Recent advances in the use of foundation models for robotics (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) have shown great potential in enabling systems to understand the semantics in the world from large-scale internet data. However, it remains an open challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand the underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different tasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and self-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational agents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent, and a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy to relevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the action distribution of the policy to more desirable states, online, while remaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware platform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and in real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the increasing presence of service robots and autonomous vehicles in human environments, navigation systems need to evolve beyond simple destination reach to incorporate social awareness. This paper introduces GSON, a novel group-based social navigation framework that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance robots' social perception capabilities. Our approach uses visual prompting to enable zero-shot extraction of social relationships among pedestrians and integrates these results with robust pedestrian detection and tracking pipelines to overcome the inherent inference speed limitations of LMMs. The planning system incorporates a mid-level planner that sits between global path planning and local motion planning, effectively preserving both global context and reactive responsiveness while avoiding disruption of the predicted social group. We validate GSON through extensive real-world mobile robot navigation experiments involving complex social scenarios such as queuing, conversations, and photo sessions. Comparative results show that our system significantly outperforms existing navigation approaches in minimizing social perturbations while maintaining comparable performance on traditional navigation metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile robots in unknown cluttered environments with irregularly shaped obstacles often face energy and communication challenges which directly affect their ability to explore these environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Confidence-Aware Contrastive Conditional Consistency Model (4CNet), for robot map prediction during decentralized, resource-limited multi-robot exploration. 4CNet uniquely incorporates: 1) a conditional consistency model for map prediction in unstructured unknown regions, 2) a contrastive map-trajectory pretraining framework for a trajectory encoder that extracts spatial information from the trajectories of nearby robots during map prediction, and 3) a confidence network to measure the uncertainty of map prediction for effective exploration under resource constraints. We incorporate 4CNet within our proposed robot exploration with map prediction architecture, 4CNet-E. We then conduct extensive comparison studies with 4CNet-E and state-of-the-art heuristic and learning methods to investigate both map prediction and exploration performance in environments consisting of irregularly shaped obstacles and uneven terrain. Results showed that 4CNet-E obtained statistically significant higher prediction accuracy and area coverage with varying environment sizes, number of robots, energy budgets, and communication limitations when compared to database and learning-based methods. Hardware experiments were performed and validated the applicability and generalizability of 4CNet-E in both unstructured indoor and real natural outdoor environments.
