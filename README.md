- **[V-JEPA 2: Self-Supervised Video Models Enable Understanding, Prediction and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09985)**  `arXiv:2506.09985`  
  _Mido Assran, Adrien Bardes, David Fan, Quentin Garrido, Russell Howes, Mojtaba, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data (robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting, and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7 recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models. Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals. Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in the physical world.

- **[How Do People Revise Inconsistent Beliefs? Examining Belief Revision in Humans with User Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09977)**  `arXiv:2506.09977`  
  _Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou, Antonio Rago, Maria Vanina Martinez, William Yeoh_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision operators to better align with human cognitive processes.

- **[Intent Factored Generation: Unleashing the Diversity in Your Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09659)**  `arXiv:2506.09659`  
  _Eltayeb Ahmed, Uljad Berdica, Martha Elliott, Danijela Horak, Jakob N. Foerster_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent, e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward. Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into many algorithms for gains across various applications.

- **[Application-Driven Value Alignment in Agentic AI Systems: Survey and Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09656)**  `arXiv:2506.09656`  
  _Wei Zeng, Hengshu Zhu, Chuan Qin, Han Wu, Yihang Cheng, Sirui Zhang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ongoing evolution of AI paradigms has propelled AI research into the Agentic AI stage. Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to increasingly situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant attention to value alignment for AI agents, which aims to ensure that an agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal norms. This paper reviews value alignment in agent systems within specific application scenarios. It integrates the advancements in AI driven by large models with the demands of social governance. Our review covers value principles, agent system application scenarios, and agent value alignment evaluation. Specifically, value principles are organized hierarchically from a top-down perspective, encompassing macro, meso, and micro levels. Agent system application scenarios are categorized and reviewed from a general-to-specific viewpoint. Agent value alignment evaluation systematically examines datasets for value alignment assessment and relevant value alignment methods. Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within agent systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field.

- **[DipLLM: Fine-Tuning LLM for Strategic Decision-making in Diplomacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09655)**  `arXiv:2506.09655`  
  _Kaixuan Xu, Jiajun Chai, Sicheng Li, Yuqian Fu, Yuanheng Zhu, Dongbin Zhao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diplomacy is a complex multiplayer game that requires both cooperation and competition, posing significant challenges for AI systems. Traditional methods rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model, surpassing its performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned LLMs for tackling complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.

- **[Fast Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion: 100x Speedup via Parallel Sparse Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09498)**  `arXiv:2506.09498`  
  _Jaesik Yoon, Hyeonseo Cho, Yoshua Bengio, Sungjin Ahn_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

- **[Comment on The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09250)**  `arXiv:2506.09250`  
  _C. Opus, A. Lawsen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Shojaee et al. (2025) report that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit "accuracy collapse" on planning puzzles beyond certain complexity thresholds. We demonstrate that their findings primarily reflect experimental design limitations rather than fundamental reasoning failures. Our analysis reveals three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments systematically exceed model output token limits at reported failure points, with models explicitly acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors' automated evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3) Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically impossible instances for N > 5 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.

- **[Robot-Gated Interactive Imitation Learning with Adaptive Intervention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09176)**  `arXiv:2506.09176`  
  _Haoyuan Cai, Zhenghao Peng, Bolei Zhou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) allows agents to acquire desired behaviors through human interventions, but current methods impose high cognitive demands on human supervisors. We propose the Adaptive Intervention Mechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive criterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function to mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on the alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when the agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent becomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the real-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our expert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert monitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to the uncertainty-based baseline Thrifty-DAgger, our method achieves a 40% improvement in terms of human take-over cost and learning efficiency. Furthermore, AIM effectively identifies safety-critical states for expert assistance, thereby collecting higher-quality expert demonstrations and reducing overall expert data and environment interactions needed.

  _Yong Liang Goh, Zhiguang Cao, Yining Ma, Jianan Zhou, Mohammed Haroon Dupty, Wee Sun Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles. Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9 real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

  _Ikkei Itoku, David Theil, Evelyn Eichelsdoerfer Uehara, Sreyoshi Bhaduri, Junnosuke Kuroda, Toshi Yumoto, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

- **[SafeCoT: Improving VLM Safety with Minimal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08399)**  `arXiv:2506.08399`  
  _Jiachen Ma, Zhanhui Zhou, Chao Yang, Chaochao Lu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from vision-language models (VLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios. We introduce SafeCoT, a lightweight, interpretable framework that leverages rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in VLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on large-scale safety annotations or complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help models reason about safety risks and make context-aware refusals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

  _Jingnan Zheng, Xiangtian Ji, Yijun Lu, Chenhang Cui, Weixiang Zhao, Gelei Deng, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content, system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored to specific safety requirements.

- **[SAFEFLOW: A Principled Protocol for Trustworthy and Transactional Autonomous Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07564)**  `arXiv:2506.07564`  
  _Peiran Li, Xinkai Zou, Zhuohang Wu, Ruifeng Li, Shuo Xing, Hanwen Zheng, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Surfer-H, a cost-efficient web agent that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLM) to perform user-defined tasks on the web. We pair it with Holo1, a new open-weight collection of VLMs specialized in web navigation and information extraction. Holo1 was trained on carefully curated data sources, including open-access web content, synthetic examples, and self-produced agentic data. Holo1 tops generalist User Interface (UI) benchmarks as well as our new web UI localization benchmark, WebClick. When powered by Holo1, Surfer-H achieves a 92.2% state-of-the-art performance on WebVoyager, striking a Pareto-optimal balance between accuracy and cost-efficiency. To accelerate research advancement in agentic systems, we are open-sourcing both our WebClick evaluation dataset and the Holo1 model weights.

  _Kourosh Shahnazari, Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh, Mohammadali Keshtparvar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The quest for interpretable reinforcement learning is a grand challenge for the deployment of autonomous decision-making systems in safety-critical applications. Modern deep reinforcement learning approaches, while powerful, tend to produce opaque policies that compromise verification, reduce transparency, and impede human oversight. To address this, we introduce BASIL (Best-Action Symbolic Interpretable Learning), a systematic approach for generating symbolic, rule-based policies via online evolutionary search with quality-diversity (QD) optimization. BASIL represents policies as ordered lists of symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring full interpretability and tractable policy complexity. By using a QD archive, the methodology in the proposed study encourages behavioral and structural diversity between top-performing solutions, while a complexity-aware fitness encourages the synthesis of compact representations. The evolutionary system supports the use of exact constraints for rule count and system adaptability for balancing transparency with expressiveness. Empirical comparisons with three benchmark tasks CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, and Acrobot-v1 show that BASIL consistently synthesizes interpretable controllers with compact representations comparable to deep reinforcement learning baselines. Herein, this article introduces a new interpretable policy synthesis method that combines symbolic expressiveness, evolutionary diversity, and online learning through a unifying framework.

  _Mengkang Hu, Yuhang Zhou, Wendong Fan, Yuzhou Nie, Bowei Xia, Tao Sun, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks. Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next generation of general-purpose AI assistants.

  Spatial reasoning is a core component of human cognition, enabling individuals to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. It relies on a nuanced understanding of spatial structures and inter-object relationships, serving as the foundation for complex reasoning and decision-making. To investigate whether current vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit similar capability, we introduce Jigsaw-Puzzles, a novel benchmark consisting of 1,100 carefully curated real-world images with high spatial complexity. Based on this dataset, we design five tasks to rigorously evaluate VLMs' spatial perception, structural understanding, and reasoning capabilities, while deliberately minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge to better isolate and assess the general spatial reasoning capability. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 24 state-of-the-art VLMs. The results show that even the strongest model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 77.14% overall accuracy and performs particularly poorly on the Order Generation task, with only 30.00% accuracy, far below the performance exceeding 90% achieved by human participants. This persistent gap underscores the need for continued progress, positioning Jigsaw-Puzzles as a challenging and diagnostic benchmark for advancing spatial reasoning research in VLMs. Our project page is atthis https URL

  _Sangyong Lee, Subo Hwang, Dohoon Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.

  _Oren Sultan, Eitan Stern, Dafna Shahaf_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.

The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

  With the development of distributed systems, microservices and cloud native technologies have become central to modern enterprise software development. Despite bringing significant advantages, these technologies also increase system complexity and operational challenges. Traditional root cause analysis (RCA) struggles to achieve automated fault response, heavily relying on manual intervention. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made breakthroughs in contextual inference and domain knowledge integration, providing new solutions for Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps). However, Existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: text input constraints, dynamic service dependency hallucinations, and context window limitations. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data, namely TAMO, for fine-grained RCA. It unifies multi-modal observational data into time-aligned representations to extract consistent features and employs specialized root cause localization and fault classification tools for perceiving the contextual environment. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLM in handling real-time changing service dependencies and raw observational data and guides LLM to generate repair strategies aligned with system contexts by structuring key information into a prompt. Experimental results show that TAMO performs well in root cause analysis when dealing with public datasets characterized by heterogeneity and common fault types, demonstrating its effectiveness.

  Understanding human preferences is crucial for improving foundation models and building personalized AI systems. However, preferences are inherently diverse and complex, making it difficult for traditional reward models to capture their full range. While fine-grained preference data can help, collecting it is expensive and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce Decomposed Reward Models (DRMs), a novel approach that extracts diverse human preferences from binary comparisons without requiring fine-grained annotations. Our key insight is to represent human preferences as vectors and analyze them using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By constructing a dataset of embedding differences between preferred and rejected responses, DRMs identify orthogonal basis vectors that capture distinct aspects of preference. These decomposed rewards can be flexibly combined to align with different user needs, offering an interpretable and scalable alternative to traditional reward models. We demonstrate that DRMs effectively extract meaningful preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, safety, humor) and adapt to new users without additional training. Our results highlight DRMs as a powerful framework for personalized and interpretable LLM alignment. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for planning. However, unlike Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-whose performance naturally improves with inference-time computation scaling-standard diffusion-based planners offer only limited avenues for the scalability. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a novel framework that integrates the generative strength of diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as inference-time computation increases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning language models (RLMs), also known as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Alibaba's QwQ, have redefined AI's problem-solving capabilities by extending LLMs with advanced reasoning mechanisms. Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures - uniquely combining reinforcement learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision schemes (Outcome-Based and Process-Based Supervision), and other related concepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent tools). We also provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM cloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM ecosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between "rich AI" and "poor AI" by lowering barriers to RLM design and experimentation.

  Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust model behavior.

  Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Voyager, promise open-ended competence in worlds such as Minecraft. However, when powered by open-weight LLMs they still falter on elementary tasks after domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose MindForge, a generative-agent framework for cultural lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural inter-agent communication; and (3) a multi-component memory system. Following the cultural learning framework, we test MindForge in both instructive and collaborative settings within Minecraft. In an instructive setting with GPT-4, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks yielding $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones and collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items than the Voyager baseline. Furthermore, in fully \textit{collaborative} settings, we find that the performance of two underachieving agents improves with more communication rounds, echoing the Condorcet Jury Theorem. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated cultural experiences.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The segmentation-free research efforts for addressing handwritten text recognition can be divided into three categories: connectionist temporal classification (CTC), hidden Markov model and encoder-decoder methods. In this paper, inspired by the above three modeling methods, we propose a new recognition network by using a novel three-dimensional (3D) attention module and global-local context information. Based on the feature maps of the last convolutional layer, a series of 3D blocks with different resolutions are split. Then, these 3D blocks are fed into the 3D attention module to generate sequential visual features. Finally, by integrating the visual features and the corresponding global-local context features, a well-designed representation can be obtained. Main canonical neural units including attention mechanisms, fully-connected layer, recurrent unit and convolutional layer are efficiently organized into a network and can be jointly trained by the CTC loss and the cross-entropy loss. Experiments on the latest Chinese handwritten text datasets (the SCUT-HCCDoc and the SCUT-EPT) and one English handwritten text dataset (the IAM) show that the proposed method can achieve comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods.

  Modeling human preferences is crucial for aligning foundation models with human values. Traditional reward modeling methods, such as the Bradley-Terry (BT) reward model, fall short in expressiveness, particularly in addressing intransitive preferences. In this paper, we introduce preference embedding, an approach that embeds responses into a latent space to capture intricate preference structures efficiently, achieving linear query complexity. Additionally, we propose preference score-based General Preference Optimization (GPO), which generalizes reward-based reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Experimental results show that our General Preference embedding Model (GPM) consistently outperforms the BT reward model on the RewardBench benchmark and effectively models cyclic preferences where any BT reward model behaves like a random guess. Furthermore, evaluations on downstream tasks such as AlpacaEval2.0, following the language model post-training with GPO and our general preference model, reveal performance improvements over BT models. These findings indicate that our method may enhance the alignment of foundation models with nuanced human values. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This article presents a method for verifying RDF triples using LLMs, with an emphasis on providing traceable arguments. Because the LLMs cannot currently reliably identify the origin of the information used to construct the response to the user prompt, our approach is to avoid using internal LLM factual knowledge altogether. Instead, verified RDF statements are compared to chunks of external documents retrieved through a web search or Wikipedia. To assess the possible application of this retrieval augmented generation (RAG) workflow on biosciences content, we evaluated 1,719 positive statements from the BioRED dataset and the same number of newly generated negative statements. The resulting precision is 88 %, and recall is 44 %. This indicates that the method requires human oversight. We also evaluated the method on the SNLI dataset, which allowed us to compare our approach with models specifically tuned for the natural language inference task. We demonstrate the method on Wikidata, where a SPARQL query is used to automatically retrieve statements needing verification. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs could be used for large-scale verification of statements in KGs, a task previously unfeasible due to human annotation costs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-hop query answering over a Knowledge Graph (KG) involves traversing one or more hops from the start node to answer a query. Path-based and logic-based methods are state-of-the-art for multi-hop question answering. The former is used in link prediction tasks. The latter is for answering complex logical queries. The logical multi-hop querying technique embeds the KG and queries in the same embedding space. The existing work incorporates First Order Logic (FOL) operators, such as conjunction ($\wedge$), disjunction ($\vee$), and negation ($\neg$), in queries. Though current models have most of the building blocks to execute the FOL queries, they cannot use the dense information of multi-modal entities in the case of Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs). We propose RConE, an embedding method to capture the multi-modal information needed to answer a query. The model first shortlists candidate (multi-modal) entities containing the answer. It then finds the solution (sub-entities) within those entities. Several existing works tackle path-based question-answering in MMKGs. However, to our knowledge, we are the first to introduce logical constructs in querying MMKGs and to answer queries that involve sub-entities of multi-modal entities as the answer. Extensive evaluation of four publicly available MMKGs indicates that RConE outperforms the current state-of-the-art.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel approach to root cause attribution of delivery risks within supply chains by integrating causal discovery with reinforcement learning. As supply chains become increasingly complex, traditional methods of root cause analysis struggle to capture the intricate interrelationships between various factors, often leading to spurious correlations and suboptimal decision-making. Our approach addresses these challenges by leveraging causal discovery to identify the true causal relationships between operational variables, and reinforcement learning to iteratively refine the causal graph. This method enables the accurate identification of key drivers of late deliveries, such as shipping mode and delivery status, and provides actionable insights for optimizing supply chain performance. We apply our approach to a real-world supply chain dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying causes of delivery delays and offering strategies for mitigating these risks. The findings have significant implications for improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability within supply chains.

  This paper introduces the Multiple Greedy Quasi-Newton (MGSR1-SP) method, a novel approach to solving strongly-convex-strongly-concave (SCSC) saddle point problems. Our method enhances the approximation of the squared indefinite Hessian matrix inherent in these problems, significantly improving both stability and efficiency through iterative greedy updates. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of MGSR1-SP, demonstrating its linear-quadratic convergence rate. Numerical experiments conducted on AUC maximization and adversarial debiasing problems, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, underscore our method's enhanced convergence rate. These results affirm the potential of MGSR1-SP to improve performance across a broad spectrum of machine learning applications where efficient and accurate Hessian approximations are crucial.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, concerns regarding their safety have become prominent. In this paper, we discover that code-switching in red-teaming queries can effectively elicit undesirable behaviors of LLMs, which are common practices in natural language. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, CSRT, to synthesize codeswitching red-teaming queries and investigate the safety and multilingual understanding of LLMs comprehensively. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs and code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages, we demonstrate that the CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than standard attacks in English and being effective in conventional safety domains. We also examine the multilingual ability of those LLMs to generate and understand codeswitching texts. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of the CSRT by generating codeswitching attack prompts with monolingual data. We finally conduct detailed ablation studies exploring code-switching and propound unintended correlation between resource availability of languages and safety alignment in existing multilingual LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), achieving high accuracy on existing benchmarks. However, their reliability under robust evaluation is questionable. This study reveals that when subjected to simple probing evaluation, state-of-the-art models perform worse than random guessing on medical diagnosis questions. To address this critical evaluation problem, we introduce the Probing Evaluation for Medical Diagnosis (ProbMed) dataset to rigorously assess LMM performance in medical imaging through probing evaluation and procedural diagnosis. Particularly, probing evaluation features pairing original questions with negation questions with hallucinated attributes, while procedural diagnosis requires reasoning across various diagnostic dimensions for each image, including modality recognition, organ identification, clinical findings, abnormalities, and positional grounding. Our evaluation reveals that top-performing models like GPT-4o, GPT-4V, and Gemini Pro perform worse than random guessing on specialized diagnostic questions, indicating significant limitations in handling fine-grained medical inquiries. Besides, models like LLaVA-Med struggle even with more general questions, and results from CheXagent demonstrate the transferability of expertise across different modalities of the same organ, showing that specialized domain knowledge is still crucial for improving performance. This study underscores the urgent need for more robust evaluation to ensure the reliability of LMMs in critical fields like medical diagnosis, and current LMMs are still far from applicable to those fields.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The new field of Explainable Planning (XAIP) has produced a variety of approaches to explain and describe the behavior of autonomous agents to human observers. Many summarize agent behavior in terms of the constraints, or ''rules,'' which the agent adheres to during its trajectories. In this work, we narrow the focus from summary to specific moments in individual trajectories, offering a ''pointwise-in-time'' view. Our novel framework, which we define on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) rules, assigns an intuitive status to any rule in order to describe the trajectory progress at individual time steps; here, a rule is classified as active, satisfied, inactive, or violated. Given a trajectory, a user may query for status of specific LTL rules at individual trajectory time steps. In this paper, we present this novel framework, named Rule Status Assessment (RSA), and provide an example of its implementation. We find that pointwise-in-time status assessment is useful as a post-hoc diagnostic, enabling a user to systematically track the agent's behavior with respect to a set of rules.

  _Thomas J. Ringstrom, Mohammadhosein Hasanbeig, Alessandro Abate_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the domain of hierarchical planning, compositionality, abstraction, and task transfer are crucial for designing algorithms that can efficiently solve a variety of problems with maximal representational reuse. Many real-world problems require non-Markovian policies to handle complex structured tasks with logical conditions, often leading to prohibitively large state representations; this requires efficient methods for breaking these problems down and reusing structure between tasks. To this end, we introduce a compositional framework called Linearly-Solvable Goal Kernel Dynamic Programming (LS-GKDP) to address the complexity of solving non-Markovian Boolean sub-goal tasks with ordering constraints. LS-GKDP combines the Linearly-Solvable Markov Decision Process (LMDP) formalism with the Options Framework of Reinforcement Learning. LMDPs can be efficiently solved as a principal eigenvector problem, and options are policies with termination conditions used as temporally extended actions; with LS-GKDP we expand LMDPs to control over options for logical tasks. This involves decomposing a high-dimensional problem down into a set of goal-condition options for each goal and constructing a goal kernel, which is an abstract transition kernel that jumps from an option's initial-states to its termination-states along with an update of the higher-level task-state. We show how an LMDP with a goal kernel enables the efficient optimization of meta-policies in a lower-dimensional subspace defined by the task grounding. Options can also be remapped to new problems within a super-exponential space of tasks without significant recomputation, and we identify cases where the solution is invariant to the task grounding, permitting zero-shot task transfer.

  Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music, politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1 score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of 0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for underserved Balkan language communities.

We further show that multilingual fine-tuning simultaneously improves cross-language generalization performance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of explicit reasoning steps in LLM-based parsing and offer a scalable, format-consistent alternative to bracket-based approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting AI-generated text is a difficult problem to begin with; detecting AI-generated text on social media is made even more difficult due to the short text length and informal, idiosyncratic language of the internet. It is nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing) particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This result is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the vulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result has implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally applicable and realistic LLM use case.

  How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa, a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1 and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining, and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all artifacts are fully open-sourced.

  Recent work has identified retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2025b), a subset of attention heads responsible for retrieving salient information in long-context language models (LMs), as measured by their copy-paste behavior in Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks. In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused Retrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from long context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect to the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g., long-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and effective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as retrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting the most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop reasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains over full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate QRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves strong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as RankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring and task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream utility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers interpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset, VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving significant improvements across several representative instruction-following benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate future research atthis https URL.

  Reviews are valuable resources for customers making purchase decisions in online shopping. However, it is impractical for customers to go over the vast number of reviews and manually conclude the prominent opinions, which prompts the need for automated opinion summarization systems. Previous approaches, either extractive or abstractive, face challenges in automatically producing grounded aspect-centric summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization system that not only captures predominant opinions from an aspect perspective with supporting evidence, but also adapts to varying domains without relying on a pre-defined set of aspects. Our proposed framework, ASESUM, summarizes viewpoints relevant to the critical aspects of a product by extracting aspect-centric arguments and measuring their salience and validity. We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing diverse perspectives of the original reviews compared to new and existing methods.

  Large language models (LLMs) have advanced conversational AI assistants. However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply personalization--adapting to individual user preferences while completing tasks--remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across diverse tasks, we reveal significant variability in their personalization capabilities, providing crucial insights for advancing conversational AI systems.

  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However, more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view. In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared (active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families support our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing the probabilistic divergence between prompt and response hidden-state distributions. Counterintuitively, we find that hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable solution for hallucination detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective rehabilitation assessment is essential for monitoring patient progress, particularly in home-based settings. Existing systems often face challenges such as data imbalance and difficulty detecting subtle movement errors. This paper introduces Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA), a method that generates synthetic skeleton data by simulating clinically relevant movement mistakes. Unlike standard augmentation techniques, EGPA targets biomechanical errors observed in rehabilitation. Combined with an attention-based graph convolutional network, EGPA improves performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Experiments demonstrate reductions in mean absolute error of up to 27.6 percent and gains in error classification accuracy of 45.8 percent. Attention visualizations show that the model learns to focus on clinically significant joints and movement phases, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability. EGPA offers a promising approach for improving automated movement quality assessment in both clinical and home-based rehabilitation contexts.

  The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions, and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect than low-arousal states like concentration.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\% and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about 30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowing how test takers answer items in educational assessments is essential for test development, to evaluate item quality, and to improve test validity. However, this process usually requires extensive pilot studies with human participants. If large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like response behavior to test items, this could open up the possibility of using them as pilot participants to accelerate test development. In this paper, we evaluate the human-likeness or psychometric plausibility of responses from 18 instruction-tuned LLMs with two publicly available datasets of multiple-choice test items across three subjects: reading, U.S. history, and economics. Our methodology builds on two theoretical frameworks from psychometrics which are commonly used in educational assessment, classical test theory and item response theory. The results show that while larger models are excessively confident, their response distributions can be more human-like when calibrated with temperature scaling. In addition, we find that LLMs tend to correlate better with humans in reading comprehension items compared to other subjects. However, the correlations are not very strong overall, indicating that LLMs should not be used for piloting educational assessments in a zero-shot setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their reliable deployment requires effective uncertainty quantification (UQ). Existing UQ methods are often heuristic and lack a probabilistic foundation. This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the role of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk perspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition probabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a fully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies uncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a given output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define a new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy. A key strength of our framework is its flexibility: it supports various definitions of uncertainty measures, embeddings, perturbation strategies, and similarity metrics. We also propose GAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the diversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric, Temperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses uncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods. The code to reproduce the results can be found atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs, such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2) Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting (FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well, with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows, expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It is important for Large Language Models to be aware of the boundary of their knowledge, the mechanism of identifying known and unknown queries. This type of awareness can help models perform adaptive inference, such as invoking RAG, engaging in slow and deep thinking, or adopting the abstention mechanism, which is beneficial to the development of efficient and trustworthy AI. In this work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level Uncertainty, which aims to determine if the model is able to address a given query without generating any tokens. To this end, we introduce a novel and training-free method called \emph{Internal Confidence}, which leverages self-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can outperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method can be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning models fundamentally rely on large quantities of high-quality data. Collecting the necessary data for these models can be challenging due to cost, scarcity, and privacy restrictions. Signed languages are visual languages used by the deaf community and are considered low-resource languages. Sign language datasets are often orders of magnitude smaller than their spoken language counterparts. Sign Language Production is the task of generating sign language videos from spoken language sentences, while Sign Language Translation is the reverse translation task. Here, we propose leveraging recent advancements in Sign Language Production to augment existing sign language datasets and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation models. For this, we utilize three techniques: a skeleton-based approach to production, sign stitching, and two photo-realistic generative models, SignGAN and SignSplat. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing the performance of Sign Language Translation models by generating variation in the signer's appearance and the motion of the skeletal data. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively augment existing datasets and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation models by up to 19%, paving the way for more robust and accurate Sign Language Translation systems, even in resource-constrained environments.

  Large language models (LLMs) offer an inexpensive yet powerful way to annotate text, but are often inconsistent when compared with experts. These errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL) and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions: First, we study how each method's performance scales with the number of expert annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in finite samples.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language Models (LMs) are prone to memorizing parts of their data during training and unintentionally emitting them at generation time, raising concerns about privacy leakage and disclosure of intellectual property. While previous research has identified properties such as context length, parameter size, and duplication frequency, as key drivers of unintended memorization, little is known about how the latent structure modulates this rate of memorization. We investigate the role of Intrinsic Dimension (ID), a geometric proxy for the structural complexity of a sequence in latent space, in modulating memorization. Our findings suggest that ID acts as a suppressive signal for memorization: compared to low-ID sequences, high-ID sequences are less likely to be memorized, particularly in overparameterized models and under sparse exposure. These findings highlight the interaction between scale, exposure, and complexity in shaping memorization.

  Integrating structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) enhances factual grounding and reasoning capabilities. This survey paper systematically examines the synergy between KGs and LLMs, categorizing existing approaches into two main groups: KG-enhanced LLMs, which improve reasoning, reduce hallucinations, and enable complex question answering; and LLM-augmented KGs, which facilitate KG construction, completion, and querying. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify critical gaps and highlight the mutual benefits of structured knowledge integration. Compared to existing surveys, our study uniquely emphasizes scalability, computational efficiency, and data quality. Finally, we propose future research directions, including neuro-symbolic integration, dynamic KG updating, data reliability, and ethical considerations, paving the way for intelligent systems capable of managing more complex real-world knowledge tasks.

  The increase in technological adoption worldwide comes with demands for novel tools to be used by the general population. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a great opportunity in this respect, but their capabilities remain limited for low-resource languages, restricting applications in countries where such languages are spoken. We create several resources to facilitate the adoption of LLMs and to support research advancements for Macedonian. We collect the largest Macedonian corpus to date, consisting of 40GB of textual data and totaling 3.5B words. To support conversational applications, we collect a 106k-instance instruction dataset, carefully built to be culturally grounded. For evaluation, we construct a Macedonian evaluation suite covering seven benchmarks. Finally, we train domestic-yak, a state-of-the-art 8B-parameter model, on our curated datasets and evaluate it against eight baseline models using the newly constructed benchmark suite. Our model outperforms all existing models in the 8B parameter range across all benchmarks, and achieves performance comparable to models up to 10x larger. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis with native speakers reveals that our model is preferred over larger counterparts, receiving higher ratings for grammatical correctness and cultural appropriateness. All datasets, code, and model weights are openly released, setting a foundation for advancing LLMs in similarly underrepresented languages. These resources are publicly available atthis http URLfor source code, and atthis http URLfor pretrained model weights and data.

  As the demand for inclusive language increases, concern has grown over the susceptibility of machine translation (MT) systems to reinforce gender stereotypes. This study investigates gender bias in two commercial MT systems, Google Translate and DeepL, focusing on the understudied English-to-Greek language pair. We address three aspects of gender bias: i) male bias, ii) occupational stereotyping, and iii) errors in anti-stereotypical translations. Additionally, we explore the potential of prompted GPT-4o as a bias mitigation tool that provides both gender-explicit and gender-neutral alternatives when necessary. To achieve this, we introduce GendEL, a manually crafted bilingual dataset of 240 gender-ambiguous and unambiguous sentences that feature stereotypical occupational nouns and adjectives. We find persistent gender bias in translations by both MT systems; while they perform well in cases where gender is explicitly defined, with DeepL outperforming both Google Translate and GPT-4o in feminine gender-unambiguous sentences, they are far from producing gender-inclusive or neutral translations when the gender is unspecified. GPT-4o shows promise, generating appropriate gendered and neutral alternatives for most ambiguous cases, though residual biases remain evident.

  SER is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of human emotions and their uneven representation under naturalistic conditions. We propose MEDUSA, a multimodal framework with a four-stage training pipeline, which effectively handles class imbalance and emotion ambiguity.

Manifold MixUp is employed for further regularization. The last two stages optimize a trainable meta-classifier that combines the ensemble predictions. Our training approach incorporates human annotation scores as soft targets, coupled with balanced data sampling and multitask learning.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding responses in external knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on a single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.

To address this, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner} to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies, whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling. Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms: Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (\textbf{\ourRoPE}) methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this \ourRoPE, we introduce \textbf{\model}, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a 4K sequence length, \model exhibits training and inference speeds that are \textbf{42.3\% and 29.5\% faster}, respectively, relative to standard Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modeling benchmarks. \model furthermore scales more effectively: \model-1.3B gains \textbf{7.22\%} in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\% gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models, enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system configuration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can introduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware, software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision -- while critical for reproducibility -- is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32, balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability.

  Suicide remains a leading cause of death in Western countries, underscoring the need for new research approaches. As social media becomes central to daily life, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior. Focusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their channels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and how do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches: computational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel longitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with life-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up approach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral indicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two also showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health Struggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach, a clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as suicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal effects beyond those identified bottom-up. Notably, YouTube Engagement, a platform-specific indicator, was not flagged by the expert, underscoring the value of bottom-up discovery. In the top-down approach, psychological assessment of suicide attempt narratives revealed that the only significant difference between individuals who attempted before and those attempted during their upload period was the motivation to share this experience: the former aimed to Help Others ($\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), while the latter framed it as part of their Personal Recovery ($\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$). By integrating these approaches, we offer a nuanced understanding of suicidality, bridging digital behavior and clinical insights.* Within-group changes in relation to the suicide attempt.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap" -- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to match the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly constrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and generation performance in DAAs.

  Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand the mental states of oneself and others, remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), which often fail to predict human mental states accurately. In this paper, we introduce UniToMBench, a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities in LLMs by integrating multi-interaction task designs and evolving story scenarios. Supported by a custom dataset of over 1,000 hand-written scenarios, UniToMBench combines perspective-taking techniques with diverse evaluation metrics to better stimulate social cognition in LLMs. Through evaluation, we observe that while models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini show consistently high accuracy in tasks involving emotional and belief-related scenarios, with results usually above 80%, there is significant variability in their performance across knowledge-based tasks. These results highlight both the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in ToM-related tasks, underscoring the value of UniToMBench as a comprehensive tool for future development.

  Generative large language models (LLMs) have become crucial for modern NLP research and applications across various languages. However, the development of foundational models specifically tailored to the Russian language has been limited, primarily due to the significant computational resources required. This paper introduces the GigaChat family of Russian LLMs, available in various sizes, including base models and instruction-tuned versions. We provide a detailed report on the model architecture, pre-training process, and experiments to guide design choices. In addition, we evaluate their performance on Russian and English benchmarks and compare GigaChat with multilingual analogs. The paper presents a system demonstration of the top-performing models accessible via an API, a Telegram bot, and a Web interface. Furthermore, we have released three open GigaChat models in open-source (this https URL), aiming to expand NLP research opportunities and support the development of industrial solutions for the Russian language.

  _Fei Ding, Baiqiao Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), while enhancing large language models(LLMs)' instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific task adaptability, often diminishes their general capabilities. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.

  Detecting deception in an increasingly digital world is both a critical and challenging task. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the automated deception detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains. We assess the performance of both open-source and commercial LLMs on three distinct datasets: real life trial interviews (RLTD), instructed deception in interpersonal scenarios (MU3D), and deceptive reviews (OpSpam). We systematically analyze the effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based in-context example selection. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection tasks, while LMMs struggle to fully leverage cross-modal cues. Additionally, we analyze the impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal gestures and video summaries, and examine the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, including direct label generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Our findings provide key insights into how LLMs process and interpret deceptive cues across modalities, highlighting their potential and limitations in real-world deception detection applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to minor input perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate Token Constraint Decoding (TCD). This simple yet effective inference-time algorithm enforces alignment between token-level predictions to enhance robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive experiments on CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired with prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded by input noise, yielding up to +39\% absolute gains for weaker models like Gemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly regularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct penalty schedules to maximize resilience. Our findings establish TCD as a practical, model-agnostic approach for improving reasoning stability under real-world imperfections and pave the way for more reliable deployment of LLMs in safety-critical or user-facing applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate a student's evolving knowledge state and predict their performance on new exercises based on performance history. Many realistic classroom settings for KT are typically low-resource in data and require online updates as students' exercise history grows, which creates significant challenges for existing KT approaches. To restore strong performance under low-resource conditions, we revisit the hierarchical knowledge concept (KC) information, which is typically available in many classroom settings and can provide strong prior when data are sparse. We therefore propose Knowledge-Tree-based Knowledge Tracing (KT$^2$), a probabilistic KT framework that models student understanding over a tree-structured hierarchy of knowledge concepts using a Hidden Markov Tree Model. KT$^2$ estimates student mastery via an EM algorithm and supports personalized prediction through an incremental update mechanism as new responses arrive. Our experiments show that KT$^2$ consistently outperforms strong baselines in realistic online, low-resource settings.

  _Haoran Zhao, Robert D.Hawkins_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Polite speech poses a fundamental alignment challenge for large language models (LLMs). Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to balance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build rapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that minimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ a similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses in both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models ($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from the computational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly prefer LLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguistic analyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politeness strategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading to misinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle on politeness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions about pragmatic alignment in AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of online news enables potential widespread publication of perceived low-quality news headlines/links. As a result, we investigated whether it was possible to automatically distinguish perceived lower-quality news headlines/links from perceived higher-quality headlines/links. We evaluated twelve machine learning models on a binary, balanced dataset of 57,544,214 worldwide news website links/headings from 2018-2024 (28,772,107 per class) with 115 extracted linguistic features. Binary labels for each text were derived from scores based on expert consensus regarding the respective news domain quality. Traditional ensemble methods, particularly the bagging classifier, had strong performance (88.1% accuracy, 88.3% F1, 80/20 train/test split). Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieved the highest accuracy (90.3%, 80/20 train/test split) but required more training time. The results suggest that both NLP features with traditional classifiers and deep learning models can effectively differentiate perceived news headline/link quality, with some trade-off between predictive performance and train time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential and versatility in content generation, its application to educational contexts presents several challenges. Models often fail to align with curriculum standards and maintain grade-appropriate reading levels consistently. Furthermore, STEM education poses additional challenges in balancing scientific explanations with everyday language when introducing complex and abstract ideas and phenomena to younger students. In this work, we propose COGENT, a curriculum-oriented framework for generating grade-appropriate educational content. We incorporate three curriculum components (science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives), control readability through length, vocabulary, and sentence complexity, and adopt a ``wonder-based'' approach to increase student engagement and interest. We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation via both LLM-as-a-judge and human expert analysis. Experimental results show that COGENT consistently produces grade-appropriate passages that are comparable or superior to human references. Our work establishes a viable approach for scaling adaptive and high-quality learning resources.

  _Yuchen Feng, Bowen Shen, Naibin Gu, Jiaxuan Zhao, Peng Fu, Zheng Lin, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture achieve high cost-efficiency by selectively activating a subset of the parameters. Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we efficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules. We implement DIVE on Llama-style LLMs with open-source training corpora. Experiments show that DIVE achieves training efficiency with minimal accuracy trade-offs, outperforming existing pruning and MoE reconstruction methods with the same number of activated parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies on end-to-end speech generation with large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual modality awareness during generation. This paper presents OmniDRCA, a parallel speech-text foundation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring dual-resolution speech representations and contrastive cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes speech and text representations in parallel while enhancing audio comprehension through contrastive alignment. Experimental results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that OmniDRCA establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among parallel joint speech-text modeling based foundation models, and achieves competitive performance compared to interleaved models. Additionally, we explore the potential of extending the framework to full-duplex conversational scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA) for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs. Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment. We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by 2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2 achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) is vital for optimizing large language models (LLMs). Recent Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) estimates advantages using multiple on-policy outputs per prompt, leading to high computational costs and low data efficiency. To address this, we introduce Replay-Enhanced Policy Optimization (RePO), which leverages diverse replay strategies to retrieve off-policy samples from a replay buffer, allowing policy optimization based on a broader and more diverse set of samples for each prompt. Experiments on five LLMs across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that RePO achieves absolute average performance gains of $18.4$ and $4.1$ points for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Qwen3-1.7B, respectively, compared to GRPO. Further analysis indicates that RePO increases computational cost by $15\%$ while raising the number of effective optimization steps by $48\%$ for Qwen3-1.7B, with both on-policy and off-policy sample numbers set to $8$.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question: can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet aligning them efficiently and effectively with human expectations remains a critical challenge. This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing novel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first address alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually curated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines training data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes instruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly improving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods. Next, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We develop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages meta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates. Furthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a refinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures token-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment across QA and mathematical reasoning tasks. Finally, we tackle the challenge of evaluating alignment. Existing benchmarks emphasize response quality but overlook adherence to specific constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce FollowBench, a multi-level, fine-grained benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to follow complex constraints across diverse instruction types. Our results expose key weaknesses in current models' constraint adherence, offering insights for future improvements.

  Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive decline that commonly impacts language ability. This work extends the paired perplexity approach to detecting AD by using a recent large language model (LLM), the instruction-following version of Mistral-7B. We improve accuracy by an average of 3.33% over the best current paired perplexity method and by 6.35% over the top-ranked method from the ADReSS 2020 challenge benchmark. Our further analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively detect AD with a clear and interpretable decision boundary in contrast to other methods that suffer from opaque decision-making processes. Finally, by prompting the fine-tuned LLMs and comparing the model-generated responses to human responses, we illustrate that the LLMs have learned the special language patterns of AD speakers, which opens up possibilities for novel methods of model interpretation and data augmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Figurative language (e.g., irony, hyperbole, understatement) is ubiquitous in human communication, resulting in utterances where the literal and the intended meanings do not match. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware RSA $(RSA)^2$ framework which models figurative language use by considering a speaker's employed rhetorical strategy. We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a speaker's motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony interpretation dataset introduced in this study.

  Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful. While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for generating more faithful self-NLE.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is, training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across tasks.

  Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300 annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3 cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports composed by human annotators.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.

  This study examines the lexical and syntactic interventions of human and LLM proofreading aimed at improving overall intelligibility in identical second language writings, and evaluates the consistency of outcomes across three LLMs (ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b). Findings show that both human and LLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to better coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However, LLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking vocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and sophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective modifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in major lexical and syntactic features across the three models.

  The present study extends recent work on Universal Dependencies annotations for second-language (L2) Korean by introducing a semi-automated framework that identifies morphosyntactic constructions from XPOS sequences and aligns those constructions with corresponding UPOS categories. We also broaden the existing L2-Korean corpus by annotating 2,998 new sentences from argumentative essays. To evaluate the impact of XPOS-UPOS alignments, we fine-tune L2-Korean morphosyntactic analysis models on datasets both with and without these alignments, using two NLP toolkits. Our results indicate that the aligned dataset not only improves consistency across annotation layers but also enhances morphosyntactic tagging and dependency-parsing accuracy, particularly in cases of limited annotated data.

  We introduce **SWE-Flow**, a novel data synthesis framework grounded in Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike existing software engineering data that rely on human-submitted issues, **SWE-Flow** automatically infers incremental development steps directly from unit tests, which inherently encapsulate high-level requirements. The core of **SWE-Flow** is the construction of a Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG), which precisely captures function interactions, enabling the generation of a structured, step-by-step *development schedule*. At each step, **SWE-Flow** produces a partial codebase, the corresponding unit tests, and the necessary code modifications, resulting in fully verifiable TDD tasks. With this approach, we generated 16,061 training instances and 2,020 test instances from real-world GitHub projects, creating the **SWE-Flow-Eval** benchmark. Our experiments show that fine-tuning open model on this dataset significantly improves performance in TDD-based coding. To facilitate further research, we release all code, datasets, models, and Docker images at [Github](this https URL).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in political discourse.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families. Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates (ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction. Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects, and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale. The code is available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support, refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons, and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models, including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning: even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to 77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3 and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement, evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation. Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24 benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23.

  While Large Language Models (LLMs) support long contexts, they struggle with performance degradation within the context window. Current solutions incur prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding cause and effect relationships remains a formidable challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in specialized domains where reasoning requires more than surface-level correlations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy, but standard RAG pipelines treat evidence as flat context, lacking the structure required to model true causal dependencies. We introduce Causal-Chain RAG (CC-RAG), a novel approach that integrates zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining into the RAG pipeline, enabling structured multi-hop inference. Given a domain specific corpus, CC-RAG constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of <cause, relation, effect> triples and uses forward/backward chaining to guide structured answer generation. Experiments on two real-world domains: Bitcoin price fluctuations and Gaucher disease, show that CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity. Both LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations consistently favor CC-RAG. Our results demonstrate that explicitly modeling causal structure enables LLMs to generate more accurate and interpretable responses, especially in specialized domains where flat retrieval fails.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid expansion of English technical terminology presents a significant challenge to traditional expert-based standardization, particularly in rapidly developing areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Manual approaches face difficulties in maintaining consistent multilingual terminology. To address this, we introduce LLM-BT, a back-translation framework powered by large language models (LLMs) designed to automate terminology verification and standardization through cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our key contributions include: (1) term-level consistency validation: by performing English -> intermediate language -> English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term consistency across different models (such as GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Grok). Case studies demonstrate over 90 percent of terms are preserved either exactly or semantically; (2) multi-path verification workflow: we develop a novel pipeline described as Retrieve -> Generate -> Verify -> Optimize, which supports both serial paths (e.g., English -> Simplified Chinese -> Traditional Chinese -> English) and parallel paths (e.g., English -> Chinese / Portuguese -> English). BLEU scores and term-level accuracy indicate strong cross-lingual robustness, with BLEU scores exceeding 0.45 and Portuguese term accuracy reaching 100 percent; (3) back-translation as semantic embedding: we reinterpret back-translation as a form of dynamic semantic embedding that uncovers latent trajectories of meaning. In contrast to static embeddings, LLM-BT offers transparent, path-based embeddings shaped by the evolution of the models. This reframing positions back-translation as an active mechanism for multilingual terminology standardization, fostering collaboration between machines and humans - machines preserve semantic integrity, while humans provide cultural interpretation.

  Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and the need for precise computation. Existing methods enhance LLM reasoning by synthesizing datasets through problem rephrasing, but face issues with generation quality and problem complexity. To address this, we propose to extract structural information with generated problem-solving code from mathematical reasoning and guide data generation with structured solutions. Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Results on our benchmark show that model performance declines as reasoning length increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities. Our code and data are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC), which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 16 samples per question and 10 or 20 training steps, RLSC improves accuracy by +13.4% on AIME2024, +21.2% on MATH500, +21.7% on Minerva Math, +20.8% on Olympiadbench, and +9.7% on AMC23. RLSC provides a simple, scalable post-training method for inference models, requiring only a small number of samples and unlabelled supervision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS) algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling, often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation. To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS) is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

  In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets. Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3 Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and multilingual retrieval.

  LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing. However, they still face significant challenges in TableQA, where real-world complexities such as diverse table structures, multilingual data, and domain-specific reasoning are crucial. Existing TableQA benchmarks are often limited by their focus on simple flat tables and suffer from data leakage. Furthermore, most benchmarks are monolingual and fail to capture the cross-lingual and cross-domain variability in practical applications. To address these limitations, we introduce TableEval, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on realistic TableQA tasks. Specifically, TableEval includes tables with various structures (such as concise, hierarchical, and nested tables) collected from four domains (including government, finance, academia, and industry reports). Besides, TableEval features cross-lingual scenarios with tables in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. To minimize the risk of data leakage, we collect all data from recent real-world documents. Considering that existing TableQA metrics fail to capture semantic accuracy, we further propose SEAT, a new evaluation framework that assesses the alignment between model responses and reference answers at the sub-question level. Experimental results have shown that SEAT achieves high agreement with human judgment. Extensive experiments on TableEval reveal critical gaps in the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs to handle these complex, real-world TableQA tasks, offering insights for future improvements.

  Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\) Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage. The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice, true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16 disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework. GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Subword-level understanding is integral to numerous tasks, including understanding multi-digit numbers, spelling mistakes, abbreviations, rhyming, and wordplay. Despite this, current large language models (LLMs) still often struggle with seemingly simple subword-level tasks like How many 'r's in 'strawberry'?. A key factor behind these failures is tokenization which obscures the fine-grained structure of words. Current alternatives, such as character-level and dropout tokenization methods, significantly increase computational costs and provide inconsistent improvements. In this paper we revisit tokenization and introduce StochasTok, a simple, efficient stochastic tokenization scheme that randomly splits tokens during training, allowing LLMs to 'see' their internal structure. Our experiments show that pretraining with StochasTok substantially improves LLMs' downstream performance across multiple subword-level language games, including character counting, substring identification, and math tasks. Furthermore, StochasTok's simplicity allows seamless integration at any stage of the training pipeline; and we demonstrate that post-training with StochasTok can instill improved subword understanding into existing pretrained models, thus avoiding costly pretraining from scratch. These dramatic improvements achieved with a minimal change suggest StochasTok holds exciting potential when applied to larger, more capable models. Code open-sourced at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation. However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences, which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable, verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based, reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework, thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm applicable across all language tasks.

  The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE, Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mistral-7B). Results show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a "mid-activation, late-amplification" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a "basic-refinement" framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination. Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10 experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency, specialization, and robustness.

  In recent years, protein-text models have gained significant attention for their potential in protein generation and understanding. Current approaches focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our observation, we propose a retrieval-enhanced method, which significantly outperforms fine-tuned LLMs for protein-to-text generation and shows accuracy and efficiency in training-free scenarios.

  Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and develop a refusal discovery method, Iterated Prefill Crawler (IPC), that uses token prefilling to find forbidden topics. We benchmark IPC on Tulu-3-8B, an open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale the crawler to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku. Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, IPC elicits CCP-aligned refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment failures of AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task: following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel. Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192 words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall, LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

  Instruction-following has emerged as a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on pre-existing documents or external resources to synthesize instruction-following data, which limits their flexibility and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce DecIF, a fully autonomous, meta-decomposition guided framework that generates diverse and high-quality instruction-following data using only LLMs. DecIF is grounded in the principle of decomposition. For instruction generation, we guide LLMs to iteratively produce various types of meta-information, which are then combined with response constraints to form well-structured and semantically rich instructions. We further utilize LLMs to detect and resolve potential inconsistencies within the generated instructions. Regarding response generation, we decompose each instruction into atomic-level evaluation criteria, enabling rigorous validation and the elimination of inaccurate instruction-response pairs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of scenarios and settings demonstrate DecIF's superior performance on instruction-following tasks. Further analysis highlights its strong flexibility, scalability, and generalizability in automatically synthesizing high-quality instruction data.

  The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), exposing limitations in their abstract reasoning abilities. In this work, we leverage task-specific data augmentations throughout the training, generation, and scoring phases, and employ a depth-first search algorithm to generate diverse, high-probability candidate solutions. Furthermore, we utilize the LLM not only as a generator but also as a scorer, using its output probabilities to select the most promising solutions. Our method achieves a score of 71.6% (286.5/400 solved tasks) on the public ARC-AGI evaluation set, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among publicly available approaches. While concurrent closed-source work has reported higher scores, our method distinguishes itself through its transparency, reproducibility, and remarkably low inference cost, averaging only around 2ct per task on readily available hardware (we assume a price of 36ct/hour for a Nvidia 4090 GPU).

  Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models (LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we leverage the Q-learning on LLMs, and propose a framework called straQ*. Our framework allows a plug-and-play LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC, determine the optimal strategy based on long-term returns, and finally guide the LLM to response. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that straQ* outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine, chain of thought, finetuning, and finite state machines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The importance of benchmarks for assessing the values of language models has been pronounced due to the growing need of more authentic, human-aligned responses. However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations that are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of assessment results to real-world LLM usage. Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for assessing those values. Through evaluating 44 LLMs with our benchmark, we find that these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values while placing less emphasis on Tradition, Power, and Achievement values. Also, our analysis reveals biases in how LLMs perceive various demographic groups, deviating from real human data.

  Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge, a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge, using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment, paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment. Our code is available here.

  _Ankush Raut, Xiaofeng Zhu, Maria Leonor Pacheco_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage contextual information in the form of structured linguistic representations. Specifically, we examine the impact of encoding both short and long contexts using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) structures across a diverse set of language tasks. We perform our analysis using 8-bit quantized and instruction-tuned versions of Llama 3.1 (8B), Phi-3, and Mistral 7B. Our results indicate that, for tasks involving short contexts, augmenting the prompt with the AMR of the original language context often degrades the performance of the underlying LLM. However, for tasks that involve long contexts, such as dialogue summarization in the SAMSum dataset, this enhancement improves LLM performance, for example, by increasing the zero-shot cosine similarity score of Llama 3.1 from 66% to 76%. This improvement is more evident in the newer and larger LLMs, but does not extend to the older or smaller ones. In addition, we observe that LLMs can effectively reconstruct the original text from a linearized AMR, achieving a cosine similarity of 81% in the best-case scenario.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Specialized reasoning language models (RLMs) have demonstrated that scaling test-time computation through detailed reasoning traces significantly enhances performance. Although these traces effectively facilitate knowledge distillation into smaller, instruction-tuned models, the precise nature of transferred reasoning remains unclear. In this study, we investigate to what extent distilled models internalize replicated stylistic patterns during reasoning. To this end, we systematically analyze reasoning traces, identifying structural and lexical patterns that characterize successful reasoning. We then introduce two new datasets -- a dataset of emergent reasoning traces and a synthetic dataset explicitly constructed to replicate these stylistic patterns -- to precisely examine their influence on distilled models' reasoning capabilities. We find that models trained on the synthetic traces achieve comparable performance, indicating that distilled reasoning abilities rely significantly on surface-level patterns. Surprisingly, we observe an increase in performance even when the synthetic traces are altered to lead to the wrong answer. Our findings highlight how stylistic patterns can be leveraged to efficiently enhance LM reasoning across diverse model families.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often lack integrated commonsense knowledge, limiting their robustness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce MAGIC-VQA, a novel framework that enhances VQA by systematically integrating commonsense knowledge with LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA employs a three-stage process: (1) Explicit Knowledge Integration from external sources, (2) By-Type Post-Processing for contextual refinement, and (3) Implicit Knowledge Augmentation using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for structured reasoning. While GNNs bring greater depth to structured inference, they enable superior relational inference beyond LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA bridges a key gap by unifying commonsensse knowledge with LVLM-driven reasoning, eliminating the need for extensive pre-training or complex prompt tuning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, significantly improving commonsense reasoning in VQA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in long chain-of-thoughts(long CoTs) have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models(LLMs). Existing work finds that the capability of long CoT reasoning can be efficiently elicited by tuning on only a few examples and can easily transfer to other tasks. This motivates us to investigate whether long CoT reasoning is a general capability for LLMs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis for this question from the perspective of representation. We find that LLMs do encode long CoT reasoning as a general capability, with a clear distinction from vanilla CoTs. Furthermore, domain-specific representations are also required for the effective transfer of long CoT reasoning. Inspired by these findings, we propose GLoRE, a novel representation engineering method to unleash the general long CoT reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GLoRE in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning reward models from human preference datasets and subsequently optimizing language models via reinforcement learning has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for aligning LLMs with human preferences. The performance of the reward model plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of alignment. Previous reward models operate at a coarse-grained level, requiring the generation of a complete response to obtain a reward value. The sparse reward may present challenges for downstream reinforcement learning. While recent efforts have attempted to learn token-level reward models, the lack of explicit semantic information makes it difficult to model the credit of every individual token. In this paper, we propose assigning scores to every sentence, introducing an intermediate-grained reward model. By segmenting the complete response into sentences and applying differential operations to reward output at the start and end positions of each sentence, we can effectively model the rewards of sentences. Moreover, a novel attention mechanism is introduced to aggregate the scores of all sentences into a response-level score, which allows it to be trained using the Bradley-Terry model. On common benchmarks, our method outperforms the response-level reward model by 2.7% on RewardBench (for reward modeling evaluation) and surpasses all baselines on AlpacaEval (for alignment evaluation).

  Personalizing Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical step in facilitating their widespread application to enhance individual life experiences. In pursuit of personalization, distilling key preference information from an individual's historical data as instructional preference context to customize LLM generation has emerged as a promising direction. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation by overlooking the inter-user comparative analysis, which is essential for identifying the inter-user differences that truly shape preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Difference-aware Personalization Learning (DPL), a novel approach that emphasizes extracting inter-user differences to enhance LLM personalization. DPL strategically selects representative users for comparison and establishes a structured standard to extract meaningful, task-relevant differences for customizing LLM generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPL significantly enhances LLM personalization. We release our code atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tool learning. In real-world scenarios, user queries are often ambiguous and incomplete, requiring effective clarification. However, existing interactive clarification approaches face two critical limitations: reliance on manually constructed datasets, which inherently constrains training data scale and diversity, and lack of error correction mechanisms during multi-turn clarification, leading to error accumulation that compromises both accuracy and efficiency. We present AskToAct, which addresses these challenges by exploiting the structural mapping between queries and their tool invocation solutions. Our key insight is that tool parameters naturally represent explicit user intents. By systematically removing key parameters from queries while retaining them as ground truth, we enable automated construction of high-quality training data. We further enhance model robustness through error-correction pairs and selective masking, enabling dynamic error detection during clarification interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AskToAct significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving above 57% accuracy in recovering critical unspecified intents and enhancing clarification efficiency by an average of 10.46% while maintaining high accuracy in tool invocation. Our framework exhibits robust performance across different model architectures and successfully generalizes to entirely unseen APIs without additional training, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o with substantially fewer computational resources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-consistency improves reasoning by aggregating diverse stochastic samples, yet the dynamics behind its efficacy remain underexplored. We reframe self-consistency as a dynamic distributional alignment problem, revealing that decoding temperature not only governs sampling randomness but also actively shapes the latent answer distribution. Given that high temperatures require prohibitively large sample sizes to stabilize, while low temperatures risk amplifying biases, we propose a confidence-driven mechanism that dynamically calibrates temperature: sharpening the sampling distribution under uncertainty to align with high-probability modes, and promoting exploration when confidence is high. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show this approach outperforms fixed-diversity baselines under limited samples, improving both average and best-case performance across varying initial temperatures without additional data or modules. This establishes self-consistency as a synchronization challenge between sampling dynamics and evolving answer distributions.

  Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly trained and tested on consistent visual-textual inputs, leaving open the question of whether they can handle inconsistencies in real-world, layout-rich content. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting pairwise inconsistencies but struggle with inconsistencies confined to single elements in complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. Our findings highlight the need for advanced multimodal reasoning and point to future research on multimodal inconsistency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) methods offer substantial efficiency gains by generating multiple tokens using a single target forward pass. However, existing SD approaches require the drafter and target models to share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the pool of possible drafters, often necessitating the training of a drafter from scratch. We present three new SD methods that remove this shared-vocabulary constraint. All three methods preserve the target distribution (i.e., they are lossless) and work with off-the-shelf models without requiring additional training or modifications. Empirically, on summarization, programming, and long-context tasks, our algorithms demonstrate significant speedups of up to 2.8x over standard autoregressive decoding. By enabling any off-the-shelf model to serve as a drafter and requiring no retraining, this work substantially broadens the applicability of the SD framework in practice.

Based on our findings and in-depth analysis, we identify several promising directions for future research aimed at enhancing LLMs' zero-shot capabilities in irony detection, reasoning, and comprehension. These include advancing contextual awareness in irony detection, exploring hybrid symbolic-neural methods, and integrating multimodal data, among others.

  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) following DeepSeek R1 to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model. Moreover, we develop our vision language model based on our Moxin model. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations such as zero-shot evaluation, few-shot evaluation, and CoT evaluation.

  This study explores the effectiveness of using knowledge graphs generated by large language models to decompose high school-level physics questions into sub-questions. We introduce a pipeline aimed at enhancing model response quality for Question Answering tasks. By employing LLMs to construct knowledge graphs that capture the internal logic of the questions, these graphs then guide the generation of subquestions. We hypothesize that this method yields sub-questions that are more logically consistent with the original questions compared to traditional decomposition techniques. Our results show that sub-questions derived from knowledge graphs exhibit significantly improved fidelity to the original question's logic. This approach not only enhances the learning experience by providing clearer and more contextually appropriate sub-questions but also highlights the potential of LLMs to transform educational methodologies. The findings indicate a promising direction for applying AI to improve the quality and effectiveness of educational content.

  Large Language Models (LLM) are usually fine-tuned to participate in dyadic or two-party dialogues, which can not adapt well to multi-party dialogues (MPD), which hinders their applications in such scenarios including multi-personal meetings, discussions and daily communication. Previous LLM-based researches mainly focus on the multi-agent framework, while their base LLMs are still pairwisely fine-tuned. In this work, we design a multi-party fine-tuning framework (MuPaS) for LLMs on the multi-party dialogue datasets, and prove such a straightforward framework can let the LLM align with the multi-party conversation style efficiently and effectively. We also design two training strategies which can convert MuPaS into the MPD simulator. Substantial experiments show that MuPaS can achieve state-of-the-art multi-party response, higher accuracy of the-next-speaker prediction, higher human and automatic evaluated utterance qualities, and can even generate reasonably with out-of-distribution scene, topic and role descriptions. The MuPaS framework bridges the LLM training with more complicated multi-party applications, such as conversation generation, virtual rehearsal or meta-universe.

Additionally, we propose Analogical CoT prompting, a prompting technique designed to allow smaller, open source models to leverage Analogical prompting, something they have struggled with, possibly due to a lack of specialist training data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current language models (LMs) use a fixed, static subword tokenizer. This default choice typically results in degraded efficiency and language capabilities, especially in languages other than English. To address this issue, we challenge the static design and propose retrofitting LMs with dynamic tokenization: a way to dynamically decide on token boundaries based on the input text via a subword-merging algorithm inspired by byte-pair encoding. We merge frequent subword sequences in a batch, then apply a pre-trained embedding-prediction hypernetwork to compute the token embeddings on-the-fly. For encoder-style models (e.g., XLM-R), this on average reduces token sequence lengths by >20% across 14 languages while degrading performance by less than 2%. The same method applied to pre-filling and scoring in decoder-style models (e.g., Mistral-7B) results in minimal performance degradation at up to 17% reduction in sequence length. Overall, we find that dynamic tokenization can mitigate the limitations of static tokenization by substantially improving inference speed and promoting fairness across languages, enabling more equitable and adaptable LMs.

  _Milena Chadimov√°, Eduard Jur√°≈°ek, Tom√°≈° Kliegr_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a novel method, referred to as "hashing", which involves masking potentially bias-inducing words in large language models (LLMs) with hash-like meaningless identifiers to reduce cognitive biases and reliance on external knowledge. The method was tested across three sets of experiments involving a total of 490 prompts. Statistical analysis using chi-square tests showed significant improvements in all tested scenarios, which covered LLama, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Mixtral models. In the first experiment, hashing decreased the fallacy rate in a modified version of the "Linda" problem aimed at evaluating susceptibility to cognitive biases. In the second experiment, it improved LLM results on the frequent itemset extraction task. In the third experiment, we found hashing is also effective when the Linda problem is presented in a tabular format rather than text, indicating that the technique works across various input representations. Overall, the method was shown to improve bias reduction and incorporation of external knowledge. Despite bias reduction, hallucination rates were inconsistently reduced across types of LLM models. These findings suggest that masking bias-inducing terms can improve LLM performance, although its effectiveness is model- and task-dependent.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that manipulate outputs via hidden triggers. Existing defense methods--designed for vision/text classification tasks--fail for text generation. We propose Internal Consistency Regularization (CROW), a defense leveraging the observation that backdoored models exhibit unstable layer-wise hidden representations when triggered, while clean models show smooth transitions. CROW enforces consistency across layers via adversarial perturbations and regularization during finetuning, neutralizing backdoors without requiring clean reference models or trigger knowledge--only a small clean dataset. Experiments across Llama-2 (7B, 13B), CodeLlama (7B, 13B), and Mistral-7B demonstrate CROW's effectiveness: it achieves significant reductions in attack success rates across diverse backdoor strategies (sentiment steering, targeted refusal, code injection) while preserving generative performance. CROW's architecture-agnostic design enables practical deployment.

  Large language models (LLMs) now exhibit near human-level performance in various tasks, but their performance drops drastically after a handful of high-resource languages due to the imbalance in pre-training data. Inspired by the human process of second language acquisition, particularly code-switching$\unicode{x2014}$the practice of language alternation in a conversation$\unicode{x2014}$we propose code-switching curriculum learning (CSCL) to enhance cross-lingual transfer for LLMs. CSCL mimics the stages of human language learning by progressively training models with a curriculum consisting of 1) token-level code-switching, 2) sentence-level code-switching, and 3) monolingual corpora. Using Qwen 2 as our underlying model, we demonstrate the efficacy of the CSCL in improving language transfer to Korean, achieving significant performance gains compared to monolingual continual pre-training methods. Ablation studies reveal that both token- and sentence-level code-switching significantly enhance cross-lingual transfer and that curriculum learning amplifies these effects. We also extend our findings into various languages, including Japanese (high-resource) and Indonesian (low-resource), and using two additional models (Gemma 2 and Phi 3.5). We further show that CSCL mitigates spurious correlations between language resources and safety alignment, presenting a robust, efficient framework for more equitable language transfer in LLMs. We observe that CSCL is effective for low-resource settings where high-quality, monolingual corpora for language transfer are hardly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The key to effective alignment lies in high-quality preference data. Recent research has focused on automated alignment, which involves developing alignment systems with minimal human intervention. However, prior research has predominantly focused on developing data generation methods, while insufficient attention has been paid to quality control mechanisms, which often produce inaccurate and unhelpful data, leading to unpredictable benefits during iterative optimization. In this paper, we present Self-Steering Optimization ($SSO$), an algorithm that autonomously generates high-quality preference data, eliminating manual annotation requirements. $SSO$ employs a specialized optimization objective to build a data generator from the policy model itself, which is used to produce accurate and on-policy data. We demonstrate $SSO$'s effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on two series of models: Llama 3 and Qwen 2. Our evaluation across diverse benchmarks shows that $SSO$ consistently outperforms baselines in human preference alignment and reward optimization. Further analysis validates $SSO$ as a scalable framework for preference optimization, benefiting the advancement in automated alignment techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) store and retrieve vast amounts of factual knowledge acquired during pre-training. Prior research has localized and identified mechanisms behind knowledge recall; however, it has only focused on English monolingual models. The question of how these mechanisms generalize to non-English languages and multilingual LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of three multilingual LLMs. First, we show that previously identified recall mechanisms in English largely apply to multilingual contexts, with nuances based on language and architecture. Next, through patching intermediate representations, we localize the role of language during recall, finding that subject enrichment is language-independent, while object extraction is language-dependent. Additionally, we discover that the last token representation acts as a Function Vector (FV), encoding both the language of the query and the content to be extracted from the subject. Furthermore, in decoder-only LLMs, FVs compose these two pieces of information in two separate stages. These insights reveal unique mechanisms in multilingual LLMs for recalling information, highlighting the need for new methodologies -- such as knowledge evaluation, fact editing, and knowledge acquisition -- that are specifically tailored for multilingual LLMs.

  This paper presents the annotation guidelines of the Balanced Arabic Readability Evaluation Corpus (BAREC), a large-scale resource for fine-grained sentence-level readability assessment in Arabic. BAREC includes 69,441 sentences (1M+ words) labeled across 19 levels, from kindergarten to postgraduate. Based on the Taha/Arabi21 framework, the guidelines were refined through iterative training with native Arabic-speaking educators. We highlight key linguistic, pedagogical, and cognitive factors in determining readability and report high inter-annotator agreement: Quadratic Weighted Kappa 81.8% (substantial/excellent agreement) in the last annotation phase. We also benchmark automatic readability models across multiple classification granularities (19-, 7-, 5-, and 3-level). The corpus and guidelines are publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but require careful alignment with human preferences. Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences. Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining. However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses. To address this, we introduce GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Best performing approaches for scholarly document quality prediction are based on embedding models, which do not allow direct explanation of classifiers as distinct words no longer correspond to the input features for model training. Although model-agnostic explanation methods such as Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) can be applied, these produce results with questionable correspondence to the ML model. We introduce a new feature importance method, Self-model Rated Entities (SMER), for logistic regression-based classification models trained on word embeddings. We show that SMER has theoretically perfect fidelity with the explained model, as its prediction corresponds exactly to the average of predictions for individual words in the text. SMER allows us to reliably determine which words or entities positively contribute to predicting impactful articles. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation is performed through five diverse experiments conducted on 50.000 research papers from the CORD-19 corpus. Through an AOPC curve analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that SMER produces better explanations than LIME for logistic regression.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The dissemination of Large Language Models (LLMs), trained at scale, and endowed with powerful text-generating abilities, has made it easier for all to produce harmful, toxic, faked or forged content. In response, various proposals have been made to automatically discriminate artificially generated from human-written texts, typically framing the problem as a binary classification problem. Early approaches evaluate an input document with a well-chosen detector LLM, assuming that low-perplexity scores reliably signal machine-made content. More recent systems instead consider two LLMs and compare their probability distributions over the document to further discriminate when perplexity alone cannot. However, using a fixed pair of models can induce brittleness in performance. We extend these approaches to the ensembling of several LLMs and derive a new, theoretically grounded approach to combine their respective strengths. Our experiments, conducted with various generator LLMs, indicate that this approach effectively leverages the strengths of each model, resulting in robust detection performance across multiple domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-critic has become a crucial mechanism for enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs. However, current approaches mainly involve basic prompts for intuitive instance-level feedback, which resembles System-1 processes and limits the reasoning capabilities. Moreover, there is a lack of in-depth investigations into the relationship between LLM's ability to criticize and its task-solving performance. To address these issues, we propose Critic-CoT, a novel framework that pushes LLMs toward System-2-like critic capability. Through a step-wise CoT reasoning paradigm and the automatic construction of distant-supervision data without human annotation, Critic-CoT enables LLMs to engage in slow, analytic self-critique and refinement, thereby improving their reasoning abilities. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that our enhanced model significantly boosts task-solving performance by filtering out invalid solutions or iterative refinement. Furthermore, we investigate the intrinsic correlation between critique and task-solving abilities within LLMs, discovering that these abilities can mutually reinforce each other rather than conflict.

  In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods have limitations that can sometimes render themthis http URLthe present paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than the answer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the motivations underlying scholarly citations is essential to evaluate research impact and pro-mote transparent scholarly communication. This study introduces CiteFusion, an ensemble framework designed to address the multi-class Citation Intent Classification task on two benchmark datasets: SciCite and ACL-ARC. The framework employs a one-vs-all decomposition of the multi-class task into class-specific binary sub-tasks, leveraging complementary pairs of SciBERT and XLNet models, independently tuned, for each citation intent. The outputs of these base models are aggregated through a feedforward neural network meta-classifier to reconstruct the original classification task. To enhance interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is employed to analyze token-level contributions, and interactions among base models, providing transparency into the classification dynamics of CiteFusion, and insights about the kind of misclassifications of the ensem-ble. In addition, this work investigates the semantic role of structural context by incorporating section titles, as framing devices, into input sentences, assessing their positive impact on classification accuracy. CiteFusion ul-timately demonstrates robust performance in imbalanced and data-scarce scenarios: experimental results show that CiteFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Macro-F1 scores of 89.60% on SciCite, and 76.24% on ACL-ARC. Furthermore, to ensure interoperability and reusability, citation intents from both datasets sche-mas are mapped to Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO) object properties, highlighting some overlaps. Finally, we describe and release a web-based application that classifies citation intents leveraging the CiteFusion models developed on SciCite.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite rising global usage of large language models (LLMs), their ability to generate long-form answers to culturally specific questions remains unexplored in many languages. To fill this gap, we perform the first study of textual multilingual long-form QA by creating CaLMQA, a dataset of 51.7K culturally specific questions across 23 different languages. We define culturally specific questions as those that refer to concepts unique to one or a few cultures, or have different answers depending on the cultural or regional context. We obtain these questions by crawling naturally-occurring questions from community web forums in high-resource languages, and by hiring native speakers to write questions in under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. Our data collection methodologies are translation-free, enabling the collection of culturally unique questions like "Kuber iki umwami wa mbere w'uburundi yitwa Ntare?" (Kirundi; English translation: "Why was the first king of Burundi called Ntare (Lion)?"). We evaluate factuality, relevance and surface-level quality of LLM-generated long-form answers, finding that (1) for many languages, even the best models make critical surface-level errors (e.g., answering in the wrong language, repetition), especially for low-resource languages; and (2) answers to culturally specific questions contain more factual errors than answers to culturally agnostic questions -- questions that have consistent meaning and answer across many cultures. We release CaLMQA to facilitate future research in cultural and multilingual long-form QA.

  Standard language ideology is reflected and reinforced in language generated by large language models (LLMs). We present a faceted taxonomy of open problems that illustrate how standard language ideology manifests in AI-generated language, alongside implications for minoritized language communities and society more broadly. We introduce the concept of standard AI-generated language ideology, a process through which LLMs position "standard" languages--particularly Standard American English (SAE)--as the linguistic default, reinforcing the perception that SAE is the most "appropriate" language. We then discuss ongoing tensions around what constitutes desirable system behavior, as well as advantages and drawbacks of generative AI tools attempting, or refusing, to imitate different English language varieties. Rather than prescribing narrow technical fixes, we offer three recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and funders that focus on shifting structural conditions and supporting more emancipatory outcomes for diverse language communities.

  Large language models (LLMs) may exhibit unintended or undesirable behaviors. Recent works have concentrated on aligning LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs. Despite these efforts, some anomalies indicate that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Does alignment fine-tuning yield have robust effects on models, or are its impacts merely superficial? In this work, we make the first exploration of this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Empirically, we demonstrate the $\mathbf{elasticity}$ of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Leveraging compression theory, we formally deduce that fine-tuning disproportionately undermines alignment relative to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We validate the presence of elasticity through experiments on models of varying types and scales. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. Furthermore, we further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with the increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our findings underscore the need to address the inherent elasticity of LLMs to mitigate their resistance to alignment. The model weight and code are available atthis http URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose "Generative Fusion Decoding" (GFD), a novel shallow fusion framework designed to integrate large language models (LLMs) into cross-modal text recognition systems for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and optical character recognition (OCR). We derive the necessary formulations to enable GFD to operate across mismatched token spaces of different models by calculating likelihood at the byte level, thereby enabling seamless fusion and synchronous progression during the decoding process. GFD is plug-and-play by design, making it readily compatible with various auto-regressive models without the need for any re-training. GFD proves effective for general ASR and OCR tasks through intermediate and frequent interactions with LLMs, surpassing cascaded methods in English and Mandarin benchmarks. In addition, GFD transfers in-context learning abilities of LLMs and allows for adaptive ASR in instruction-aware and long-context settings, yielding significant WER reductions of up to 17.7\%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention, yet remains challenging due to the complexity of assessing response appropriateness. Traditional evaluation metrics, typically trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores to responses that share greater content similarity with contexts. However, adversarial negative responses, despite possessing high lexical overlap with contexts, can be semantically incongruous. Consequently, existing metrics struggle to effectively evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still face challenges in handling adversarial negative examples. We propose a novel evaluation framework that integrates Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) enhanced domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs. Our SLMs explicitly incorporate AMR graph information through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning, while both SLM predictions and AMR knowledge are integrated into LLM prompts for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our comprehensive ablation studies reveal that AMR graph information contributes substantially more to performance improvements. Our framework achieves strong correlations with human judgments across multiple datasets, establishing a new benchmark for dialogue evaluation. Our code and data are publicly available.

  Automated essay scoring (AES) is a useful tool in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing education, offering real-time essay scores for students and instructors. However, previous AES models were trained on essays and scores irrelevant to the practical scenarios of EFL writing education and usually provided a single holistic score due to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we release DREsS, a large-scale, standard dataset for rubric-based automated essay scoring with 48.9K samples in total. DREsS comprises three sub-datasets: DREsS_New, DREsS_Std., and DREsS_CASE. We collect DREsS_New, a real-classroom dataset with 2.3K essays authored by EFL undergraduate students and scored by English education experts. We also standardize existing rubric-based essay scoring datasets as DREsS_Std. We suggest CASE, a corruption-based augmentation strategy for essays, which generates 40.1K synthetic samples of DREsS_CASE and improves the baseline results by 45.44%. DREsS will enable further research to provide a more accurate and practical AES system for EFL writing education.

  We propose attribute-aware multimodal entity linking, where the input consists of a mention described with a text paragraph and images, and the goal is to predict the corresponding target entity from a multimodal knowledge base (KB) where each entity is also accompanied by a text description, visual images, and a collection of attributes that present the meta-information of the entity in a structured format. To facilitate this research endeavor, we construct AMELI, encompassing a new multimodal entity linking benchmark dataset that contains 16,735 mentions described in text and associated with 30,472 images, and a multimodal knowledge base that covers 34,690 entities along with 177,873 entity images and 798,216 attributes. To establish baseline performance on AMELI, we experiment with several state-of-the-art architectures for multimodal entity linking and further propose a new approach that incorporates attributes of entities into disambiguation. Experimental results and extensive qualitative analysis demonstrate that extracting and understanding the attributes of mentions from their text descriptions and visual images play a vital role in multimodal entity linking. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate attributes in the multimodal entity linking task. The programs, model checkpoints, and the dataset are publicly available atthis https URL.

  We introduce PlayerOne, the first egocentric realistic world simulator, facilitating immersive and unrestricted exploration within vividly dynamic environments. Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme, enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation. Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world modeling and its diverse applications.

  Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy.

  We study the problem of making 3D scene reconstructions interactive by asking the following question: can we predict the sounds of human hands physically interacting with a scene? First, we record a video of a human manipulating objects within a 3D scene using their hands. We then use these action-sound pairs to train a rectified flow model to map 3D hand trajectories to their corresponding audio. At test time, a user can query the model for other actions, parameterized as sequences of hand poses, to estimate their corresponding sounds. In our experiments, we find that our generated sounds accurately convey material properties and actions, and that they are often indistinguishable to human observers from real sounds.

  Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality. To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both artifact detection and difference caption generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing benchmarks for assessing the spatio-temporal understanding and reasoning abilities of video language models are susceptible to score inflation due to the presence of shortcut solutions based on superficial visual or textual cues. This paper mitigates the challenges in accurately assessing model performance by introducing the Minimal Video Pairs (MVP) benchmark, a simple shortcut-aware video QA benchmark for assessing the physical understanding of video language models. The benchmark is comprised of 55K high-quality multiple-choice video QA examples focusing on physical world understanding. Examples are curated from nine video data sources, spanning first-person egocentric and exocentric videos, robotic interaction data, and cognitive science intuitive physics benchmarks. To mitigate shortcut solutions that rely on superficial visual or textual cues and biases, each sample in MVP has a minimal-change pair -- a visually similar video accompanied by an identical question but an opposing answer. To answer a question correctly, a model must provide correct answers for both examples in the minimal-change pair; as such, models that solely rely on visual or textual biases would achieve below random performance. Human performance on MVP is 92.9\%, while the best open-source state-of-the-art video-language model achieves 40.2\% compared to random performance at 25\%.

  Recent advances in 4D content generation have attracted increasing attention, yet creating high-quality animated 3D models remains challenging due to the complexity of modeling spatio-temporal distributions and the scarcity of 4D training data. In this paper, we present AnimateAnyMesh, the first feed-forward framework that enables efficient text-driven animation of arbitrary 3D meshes. Our approach leverages a novel DyMeshVAE architecture that effectively compresses and reconstructs dynamic mesh sequences by disentangling spatial and temporal features while preserving local topological structures. To enable high-quality text-conditional generation, we employ a Rectified Flow-based training strategy in the compressed latent space. Additionally, we contribute the DyMesh Dataset, containing over 4M diverse dynamic mesh sequences with text annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates semantically accurate and temporally coherent mesh animations in a few seconds, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and efficiency. Our work marks a substantial step forward in making 4D content creation more accessible and practical. All the data, code, and models will be open-released.

  How can we reliably simulate future driving scenarios under a wide range of ego driving behaviors? Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator (e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones. To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.

  Recent progress in 3D object generation has greatly improved both the quality and efficiency. However, most existing methods generate a single mesh with all parts fused together, which limits the ability to edit or manipulate individual parts. A key challenge is that different objects may have a varying number of parts. To address this, we propose a new end-to-end framework for part-level 3D object generation. Given a single input image, our method generates high-quality 3D objects with an arbitrary number of complete and semantically meaningful parts. We introduce a dual volume packing strategy that organizes all parts into two complementary volumes, allowing for the creation of complete and interleaved parts that assemble into the final object. Experiments show that our model achieves better quality, diversity, and generalization than previous image-based part-level generation methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Creating a stroke-by-stroke evolution process of a visual artwork tries to bridge the emotional and educational gap between the finished static artwork and its creation process. Recent stroke-based painting systems focus on capturing stroke details by predicting and iteratively refining stroke parameters to maximize the similarity between the input image and the rendered output. However, these methods often struggle to produce stroke compositions that align with artistic principles and intent. To address this, we explore an image-to-painting method that (i) facilitates semantic guidance for brush strokes in targeted regions, (ii) computes the brush stroke parameters, and (iii) establishes a sequence among segments and strokes to sequentially render the final painting. Experimental results on various input image types, such as face images, paintings, and photographic images, show that our method aligns with a region-based painting strategy while rendering a painting with high fidelity and superior stroke quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward, text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

  Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising field for developing clinical decision support systems, yet progress is often limited by the available datasets, which can lack clinical complexity and visual diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new, large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community. Code and data:this https URLandthis https URL

  Recently, we have witnessed the great success of the generalist model in natural language processing. The generalist model is a general framework trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing number of researchers are venturing into the realm of applying these models to computer vision tasks. However, the inputs and outputs of vision tasks are more diverse, and it is difficult to summarize them as a unified representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the vision generalist models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field. First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks. Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a brief excursion into related domains, shedding light on their interconnections and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application scenarios, undertake a thorough examination of the persistent challenges, and offer insights into possible directions for future research endeavors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information. Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of $2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$ interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly available here:this https URL.

  The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently, there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud models as backbones.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering (VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely outcomes of different actions and events through five question types: counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make accurate predictions in real-world settings.

  Developing 3D-VL generalists capable of understanding 3D scenes and following natural language instructions to perform a wide range of tasks has been a long-standing goal in the 3D-VL community. Despite recent progress, 3D-VL models still lag behind their 2D counterparts in capability and robustness, falling short of the generalist standard. A key obstacle to developing 3D-VL generalists lies in data scalability, hindered by the lack of an efficient scene representation. We propose LEO-VL, a 3D-VL model built upon condensed feature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation that bridges 2D perception and 3D spatial structure while significantly reducing token overhead. This efficiency unlocks large-scale training towards 3D-VL generalist, for which we curate over 700k high-quality 3D-VL data spanning four domains of real-world indoor scenes and five tasks such as captioning and dialogue. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of 3D QA benchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Ablation studies confirm the efficiency of our representation, the importance of task and scene diversity, and the validity of our data curation principle. Furthermore, we introduce SceneDPO, a novel post-training objective that enhances the robustness of 3D-VL models. We hope our findings contribute to the advancement of scalable and robust 3D-VL generalists.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  _Jianhan Qi, Yuheng Jia, Hui Liu, Junhui Hou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MetricHMR (Metric Human Mesh Recovery), an approach for metric human mesh recovery with accurate global translation from monocular images. In contrast to existing HMR methods that suffer from severe scale and depth ambiguity, MetricHMR is able to produce geometrically reasonable body shape and global translation in the reconstruction results. To this end, we first systematically analyze previous HMR methods on camera models to emphasize the critical role of the standard perspective projection model in enabling metric-scale HMR. We then validate the acceptable ambiguity range of metric HMR under the standard perspective projection model. Finally, we contribute a novel approach that introduces a ray map based on the standard perspective projection to jointly encode bounding-box information, camera parameters, and geometric cues for End2End metric HMR without any additional metric-regularization modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, even compared with sequential HMR methods, in metric pose, shape, and global translation estimation across both indoor and in-the-wild scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating images in a consistent reference visual style remains a challenging computer vision task. State-of-the-art methods aiming for style-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content from stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as a reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a method designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner while preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content leakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that controls the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches containing the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best balances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the localization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a reference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any method-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the stylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to quantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired content leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances, consistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content leakage.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tiny object detection (TOD) reveals a fundamental flaw in feature pyramid networks: high-level features (P5-P6) frequently receive zero positive anchors under standard label assignment protocols, leaving their semantic representations untrained due to exclusion from loss computation. This creates dual deficiencies: (1) Stranded high-level features become semantic dead-ends without gradient updates, while (2) low-level features lack essential semantic context for robust classification. We propose E-FPN-BS that systematically converts wasted high-level semantics into low-level feature enhancements. To address these issues, we propose E-FPN-BS, a novel architecture integrating multi-scale feature enhancement and adaptive optimization. First, our Context Enhancement Module(CEM) employs dual-branch processing to align and compress high-level features for effective global-local fusion. Second, the Foreground-Background Separation Module (FBSM) generates spatial gating masks that dynamically amplify discriminative regions. To address gradient imbalance across object scales, we further propose a Dynamic Gradient-Balanced Loss (DCLoss) that automatically modulates loss contributions via scale-aware gradient equilibrium. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance and generalization ability of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning self-supervised representations that are invariant and equivariant to transformations is crucial for advancing beyond traditional visual classification tasks. However, many methods rely on predictor architectures to encode equivariance, despite evidence that architectural choices, such as capsule networks, inherently excel at learning interpretable pose-aware representations. To explore this, we introduce EquiCaps (Equivariant Capsule Network), a capsule-based approach to pose-aware self-supervision that eliminates the need for a specialised predictor for enforcing equivariance. Instead, we leverage the intrinsic pose-awareness capabilities of capsules to improve performance in pose estimation tasks. To further challenge our assumptions, we increase task complexity via multi-geometric transformations to enable a more thorough evaluation of invariance and equivariance by introducing 3DIEBench-T, an extension of a 3D object-rendering benchmark dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that EquiCaps outperforms prior state-of-the-art equivariant methods on rotation prediction, achieving a supervised-level $R^2$ of 0.78 on the 3DIEBench rotation prediction benchmark and improving upon SIE and CapsIE by 0.05 and 0.04 $R^2$, respectively. Moreover, in contrast to non-capsule-based equivariant approaches, EquiCaps maintains robust equivariant performance under combined geometric transformations, underscoring its generalisation capabilities and the promise of predictor-free capsule architectures.

  _Haoru Wang, Kai Ye, Yangyan Li, Wenzheng Chen, Baoquan Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider the problem of generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS), which aims to generate photorealistic novel views from sparse or even unposed 2D images without per-scene optimization. This task remains fundamentally challenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and ambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D knowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding explicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and ground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts have sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera poses of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and the necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend: the performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as data scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D knowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of reducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated by and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D inductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By eliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and learns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D inductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel views, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed inputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our data-centric paradigm.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3) dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R, VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo, a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1) GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

  We present IntPhys 2, a video benchmark designed to evaluate the intuitive physics understanding of deep learning models. Building on the original IntPhys benchmark, IntPhys 2 focuses on four core principles related to macroscopic objects: Permanence, Immutability, Spatio-Temporal Continuity, and Solidity. These conditions are inspired by research into intuitive physical understanding emerging during early childhood. IntPhys 2 offers a comprehensive suite of tests, based on the violation of expectation framework, that challenge models to differentiate between possible and impossible events within controlled and diverse virtual environments. Alongside the benchmark, we provide performance evaluations of several state-of-the-art models. Our findings indicate that while these models demonstrate basic visual understanding, they face significant challenges in grasping intuitive physics across the four principles in complex scenes, with most models performing at chance levels (50%), in stark contrast to human performance, which achieves near-perfect accuracy. This underscores the gap between current models and human-like intuitive physics understanding, highlighting the need for advancements in model architectures and training methodologies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions, often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting generalization and performance. We open source our code atthis https URL.

  Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate, non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to dynamic scene reconstruction.

  Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare, criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs. Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841 macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS, establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset will be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While text-to-3D generation has attracted growing interest, existing methods often struggle to produce 3D assets that align well with human preferences. Current preference alignment techniques for 3D content typically rely on hardly-collected preference-paired multi-view 2D images to train 2D reward models, when then guide 3D generation -- leading to geometric artifacts due to their inherent 2D bias. To address these limitations, we construct 3D-MeshPref, the first large-scale unpaired 3D preference dataset, featuring diverse 3D meshes annotated by a large language model and refined by human evaluators. We then develop RewardCS, the first reward model trained directly on unpaired 3D-MeshPref data using a novel Cauchy-Schwarz divergence objective, enabling effective learning of human-aligned 3D geometric preferences without requiring paired comparisons. Building on this, we propose DreamCS, a unified framework that integrates RewardCS into text-to-3D pipelines -- enhancing both implicit and explicit 3D generation with human preference feedback. Extensive experiments show DreamCS outperforms prior methods, producing 3D assets that are both geometrically faithful and human-preferred. Code and models will be released publicly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable 8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization. We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training, our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over non-calibrated models.

  Reconstructing facial images from black-box recognition models poses a significant privacy threat. While many methods require access to embeddings, we address the more challenging scenario of model inversion using only similarity scores. This paper introduces DarkerBB, a novel approach that reconstructs color faces by performing zero-order optimization within a PCA-derived eigenface space. Despite this highly limited information, experiments on LFW, AgeDB-30, and CFP-FP benchmarks demonstrate that DarkerBB achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracies in the similarity-only setting, with competitive query efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Absolute localization, aiming to determine an agent's location with respect to a global reference, is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various applications, but it becomes challenging when global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based absolute localization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference satellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied scenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level image matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences introduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source image matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates a semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a lightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching module, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first establish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural constraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine features and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV absolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on relative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module before the proposed hierarchical image matching modules. Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets and a newly introduced CS-UAV dataset demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under various challenging conditions, confirming its effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing multimodal methods typically assume that different modalities share the same category set. However, in real-world applications, the category distributions in multimodal data exhibit inconsistencies, which can hinder the model's ability to effectively utilize cross-modal information for recognizing all categories. In this work, we propose the practical setting termed Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Category-set Learning (MMHCL), where models are trained in heterogeneous category sets of multi-modal data and aim to recognize complete classes set of all modalities during test. To effectively address this task, we propose a Class Similarity-based Cross-modal Fusion model (CSCF). Specifically, CSCF aligns modality-specific features to a shared semantic space to enable knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes. It then selects the most discriminative modality for decision fusion through uncertainty estimation. Finally, it integrates cross-modal information based on class similarity, where the auxiliary modality refines the prediction of the dominant one. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple benchmark datasets, effectively addressing the MMHCL task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation, text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness of our proposed calibration approach.

  Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup, and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Micro-expression recognition (MER), a critical subfield of affective computing, presents greater challenges than macro-expression recognition due to its brief duration and low intensity. While incorporating prior knowledge has been shown to enhance MER performance, existing methods predominantly rely on simplistic, singular sources of prior knowledge, failing to fully exploit multi-source information. This paper introduces the Multi-Prior Fusion Network (MPFNet), leveraging a progressive training strategy to optimize MER tasks. We propose two complementary encoders: the Generic Feature Encoder (GFE) and the Advanced Feature Encoder (AFE), both based on Inflated 3D ConvNets (I3D) with Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanisms, to improve the model's ability to capture spatiotemporal and channel-specific features. Inspired by developmental psychology, we present two variants of MPFNet--MPFNet-P and MPFNet-C--corresponding to two fundamental modes of infant cognitive development: parallel and hierarchical processing. These variants enable the evaluation of different strategies for integrating prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPFNet significantly improves MER accuracy while maintaining balanced performance across categories, achieving accuracies of 0.811, 0.924, and 0.857 on the SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM datasets, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMIC and SAMM datasets.

  Cell instance segmentation is critical to analyzing biomedical images, yet accurately distinguishing tightly touching cells remains a persistent challenge. Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method. Extensive experiments on various modes demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring, its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240 synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration, and blood oxygen signals. Our experiments demonstrate that combining RGB and IR video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously. Dataset and code are open atthis https URL.

  Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings, while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811 RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.

  Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability, supporting its potential for practical AD screening.

  Dual encoder Vision-Language Models (VLM) such as CLIP are widely used for image-text retrieval tasks. However, those models struggle with compositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their retrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to improve the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In comparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this paper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image and a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we extract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using a VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining matches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the individual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder VLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL compositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the performance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential of inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for attribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an extensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually essential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific areas to further improve inference-time approaches.

  Recent advances in reasoning-centric models promise improved robustness through mechanisms such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling. However, their ability to withstand misleading user input remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average) following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback. Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks, GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops exceeding 53% on average. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in the robustness of reasoning models, highlighting the gap between step-by-step reasoning and belief persistence.

  Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore, requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases atthis https URL.

  Articulated objects are ubiquitous in everyday life, and accurate 3D representations of their geometry and motion are critical for numerous applications. However, in the absence of human annotation, existing approaches still struggle to build a unified representation for objects that contain multiple movable parts. We introduce DeGSS, a unified framework that encodes articulated objects as deformable 3D Gaussian fields, embedding geometry, appearance, and motion in one compact representation. Each interaction state is modeled as a smooth deformation of a shared field, and the resulting deformation trajectories guide a progressive coarse-to-fine part segmentation that identifies distinct rigid components, all in an unsupervised manner. The refined field provides a spatially continuous, fully decoupled description of every part, supporting part-level reconstruction and precise modeling of their kinematic relationships. To evaluate generalization and realism, we enlarge the synthetic PartNet-Mobility benchmark and release RS-Art, a real-to-sim dataset that pairs RGB captures with accurately reverse-engineered 3D models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and stability.

  Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.

  Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space, facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering (73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

  Human trajectory forecasting is crucial in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics and surveillance. Accurate forecasting requires models to consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models, improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when integrated with the proposed module. The code is available atthis https URL.

  _Mingxiao LI, mang ning, Marie-Francine Moens_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and consistent visual stories.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Holistic 3D scene understanding, which jointly models geometry, appearance, and semantics, is crucial for applications like augmented reality and robotic interaction. Existing feed-forward 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., LSM) are limited to extracting language-based semantics from scenes, failing to achieve holistic scene comprehension. Additionally, they suffer from low-quality geometry reconstruction and noisy artifacts. In contrast, per-scene optimization methods rely on dense input views, which reduces practicality and increases complexity during deployment. In this paper, we propose SemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which unifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint geometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic Gaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a cost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities, enhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage distillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal semantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable and open-vocabulary segmentation. Video results are available atthis https URL.

  _Zhaoyang Wei, Chenhui Qiang, Bowen Jiang, Xumeng Han, Xuehui Yu, Zhenjun Han_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes. AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria: comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level, point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.

  Road networks are crucial for mapping, autonomous driving, and disaster response. While manual annotation is costly, deep learning offers efficient extraction. Current methods include postprocessing (prone to errors), global parallel (fast but misses nodes), and local iterative (accurate but slow). We propose GLD-Road, a two-stage model combining global efficiency and local precision. First, it detects road nodes and connects them via a Connect Module. Then, it iteratively refines broken roads using local searches, drastically reducing computation. Experiments show GLD-Road outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving APLS by 1.9% (City-Scale) and 0.67% (SpaceNet3). It also reduces retrieval time by 40% vs. Sat2Graph (global) and 92% vs. RNGDet++ (local). The experimental results are available atthis https URL.

  _Yi Zhang, Yi Wang, Yawen Cui, Lap-Pui Chau_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes 3DGeoDet, a novel geometry-aware 3D object detection approach that effectively handles single- and multi-view RGB images in indoor and outdoor environments, showcasing its general-purpose applicability. The key challenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric cues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images and 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D geometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on predicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to learn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly through the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D awareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation, the truncated signed distance function (TSDF). Without requiring supervision from 3D signals, we significantly improve the model's comprehension of 3D geometry by leveraging intermediate 3D representations and achieve end-to-end training. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art image-based methods on both single- and multi-view benchmark datasets across diverse environments, achieving a 9.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the SUN RGB-D dataset, a 3.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the ScanNetV2 dataset, and a 0.19 AP3D@0.7 improvement on the KITTI dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cutting-edge works have demonstrated that text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models can generate adversarial patches that mislead state-of-the-art object detectors in the physical world, revealing detectors' vulnerabilities and risks. However, these methods neglect the T2I patches' attack effectiveness when observed from different views in the physical world (i.e., angle robustness of the T2I adversarial patches). In this paper, we study the angle robustness of T2I adversarial patches comprehensively, revealing their angle-robust issues, demonstrating that texts affect the angle robustness of generated patches significantly, and task-specific linguistic instructions fail to enhance the angle robustness. Motivated by the studies, we introduce Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL), a simple and flexible approach that learns a generalizable concept (i.e., text embeddings in implementation) representing the capability of generating angle-robust patches. The learned concept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to generate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to viewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world experiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that AngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial patches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success rates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research advances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides insights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties in T2I-generated contents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for radiance field rendering, but it typically requires millions of redundant Gaussian primitives, overwhelming memory and rendering budgets. Existing compaction approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians; and (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques. Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural rendering.

  _Beomsik Cho, Jaehyung Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos remains a fundamental challenge in 3D vision. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision, and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation, eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent development of feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents a new paradigm to reconstruct 3D scenes. Using neural networks trained on large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward 3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only 6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25% of the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time.

  Historical satellite imagery, such as mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole data, offers rare insights into understanding early urban development and long-term transformation. However, severe quality degradation (e.g., distortion, misalignment, and spectral scarcity) and annotation absence have long hindered semantic segmentation on such historical RS imagery. To bridge this gap and enhance understanding of urban development, we introduce $\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$, an annotated segmentation dataset based on historical satellite imagery with the earliest observation time among all existing segmentation datasets, along with a benchmark framework for unsupervised segmentation tasks, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$. First, $\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$ serves as a novel, expertly annotated semantic segmentation dataset built on mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole imagery, covering 1,240 km$^2$ and key urban classes (buildings, roads, farmland, water). As the earliest segmentation dataset of its kind, it provides a pioneering benchmark for historical urban understanding. Second, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$(Unsupervised Segmentation Model) is a novel unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for historical RS imagery. It employs a confidence-aware alignment mechanism and focal-confidence loss based on a self-supervised learning architecture, which generates robust pseudo-labels and adaptively prioritizes prediction difficulty and label reliability to improve unsupervised segmentation on noisy historical data without manual supervision. Experiments show Urban1960SatUSM significantly outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods on Urban1960SatSeg for segmenting historical urban scenes, promising in paving the way for quantitative studies of long-term urban change using modern computer vision.

  In-context learning (ICL), a predominant trend in instruction learning, aims at enhancing the performance of large language models by providing clear task guidance and examples, improving their capability in task understanding and execution. This paper investigates ICL on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and explores the policies of multi-modal demonstration selection. Existing research efforts in ICL face significant challenges: First, they rely on pre-defined demonstrations or heuristic selecting strategies based on human intuition, which are usually inadequate for covering diverse task requirements, leading to sub-optimal solutions; Second, individually selecting each demonstration fails in modeling the interactions between them, resulting in information redundancy. Unlike these prevailing efforts, we propose a new exploration-exploitation reinforcement learning framework, which explores policies to fuse multi-modal information and adaptively select adequate demonstrations as an integrated whole. The framework allows LVLMs to optimize themselves by continually refining their demonstrations through self-exploration, enabling the ability to autonomously identify and generate the most effective selection policies for in-context learning. Experimental results verify the superior performance of our approach on four Visual Question-Answering (VQA) datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the generalization capability of few-shot LVLMs.

  Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving systems, as it lays the foundations for advanced perception and precise path planning modules. Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles. By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset, where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks, including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various testing sequences.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-set domain generalization(OSDG) for hyperspectral image classification presents significant challenges due to the presence of unknown classes in target domains and the need for models to generalize across multiple unseen domains without target-specific adaptation. Existing domain adaptation methods assume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the fundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to negative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that combines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement (SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network (DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty Disentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module extracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through attention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while DCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel pathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation using Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable open-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive rejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral classification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the target domain during training. The implementation will be made available atthis https URLupon acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  CLIP-based domain generalization aims to improve model generalization to unseen domains by leveraging the powerful zero-shot classification capabilities of CLIP and multiple source datasets. Existing methods typically train a single model across multiple source domains to capture domain-shared information. However, this paradigm inherently suffers from two types of conflicts: 1) sample conflicts, arising from noisy samples and extreme domain shifts among sources; and 2) optimization conflicts, stemming from competition and trade-offs during multi-source training. Both hinder the generalization and lead to suboptimal solutions. Recent studies have shown that model merging can effectively mitigate the competition of multi-objective optimization and improve generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose Harmonizing and Merging (HAM), a novel source model merging framework for CLIP-based domain generalization. During the training process of the source models, HAM enriches the source samples without conflicting samples, and harmonizes the update directions of all models. Then, a redundancy-aware historical model merging method is introduced to effectively integrate knowledge across all source models. HAM comprehensively consolidates source domain information while enabling mutual enhancement among source models, ultimately yielding a final model with optimal generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based models have achieved strong performance in remote sensing image captioning by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information. However, their practical deployment is hindered by high computational costs, especially in multi-modal frameworks that employ separate transformer-based encoders and decoders. In addition, existing remote sensing image captioning models primarily focus on high-level semantic extraction while often overlooking fine-grained structural features such as edges, contours, and object boundaries. To address these challenges, a lightweight transformer architecture is proposed by reducing the dimensionality of the encoder layers and employing a distilled version of GPT-2 as the decoder. A knowledge distillation strategy is used to transfer knowledge from a more complex teacher model to improve the performance of the lightweight network. Furthermore, an edge-aware enhancement strategy is incorporated to enhance image representation and object boundary understanding, enabling the model to capture fine-grained spatial details in remote sensing images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves caption quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR) method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs, we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content, image quality, and image-text synergy.Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal systems.

  3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods, however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand, points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, ODG, which combines BEV and sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention, which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ODG. Moreover, ODG also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest efficient approaches.

  We propose Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation (NCVSD), a novel method for distilling pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers. We achieve this by revealing that the unconditional score function implicitly characterizes the score function of denoising posterior distributions. By integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic inference for flexible and controllable sampling. We evaluate NCVSD through extensive experiments, including class-conditional image generation and inverse problem solving. By scaling the test-time compute, our method outperforms teacher diffusion models and is on par with consistency models of larger sizes. Additionally, with significantly fewer NFEs than diffusion-based methods, we achieve record-breaking LPIPS on inverse problems.

  In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion, synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the internet.

  _Xinya Liu, Jianghao Wu, Tao Lu, Shaoting Zhang, Guotai Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain Adaptation (DA) is crucial for robust deployment of medical image segmentation models when applied to new clinical centers with significant domain shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs (CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization. Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2) SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is close to that of supervised training in the target domain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the trustworthiness of AI systems. Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features, refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across various models. The code is released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In real-word scenarios, person re-identification (ReID) expects to identify a person-of-interest via the descriptive query, regardless of whether the query is a single modality or a combination of multiple modalities. However, existing methods and datasets remain constrained to limited modalities, failing to meet this requirement. Therefore, we investigate a new challenging problem called Omni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve effective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries. To address dataset scarcity, we construct ORBench, the first high-quality multi-modal dataset comprising 1,000 unique identities across five modalities: RGB, infrared, color pencil, sketch, and textual description. This dataset also has significant superiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and textual information. It could serve as an ideal platform for follow-up investigations in OM-ReID. Moreover, we propose ReID5o, a novel multi-modal learning framework for person ReID. It enables synergistic fusion and cross-modal alignment of arbitrary modality combinations in a single model, with a unified encoding and multi-expert routing mechanism proposed. Extensive experiments verify the advancement and practicality of our ORBench. A wide range of possible models have been evaluated and compared on it, and our proposed ReID5o model gives the best performance. The dataset and code will be made publicly available atthis https URL.

  _Qijian Tian, Xin Tan, Jingyu Gong, Yuan Xie, Lizhuang Ma_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that unifies 3D scene and semantic field reconstruction. Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields facilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment. However, key challenges include embedding semantics into 3D representations, achieving generalizable real-time reconstruction, and ensuring practical applicability by using only images as input without camera parameters or ground truth depth. To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to predict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated and unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D scene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and predict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard, eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage, our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can be further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner. Experiments on novel view synthesis and novel view segmentation demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances for unifying 3D scene and semantic field reconstruction.

  This paper studies the problem of Line Segment Detection (LSD) for the characterization of line geometry in images, with the aim of learning a domain-agnostic robust LSD model that works well for any natural images. With the focus of scalable self-supervised learning of LSD, we revisit and streamline the fundamental designs of (deep and non-deep) LSD approaches to have a high-performing and efficient LSD learner, dubbed as ScaleLSD, for the curation of line geometry at scale from over 10M unlabeled real-world images. Our ScaleLSD works very well to detect much more number of line segments from any natural images even than the pioneered non-deep LSD approach, having a more complete and accurate geometric characterization of images using line segments. Experimentally, our proposed ScaleLSD is comprehensively testified under zero-shot protocols in detection performance, single-view 3D geometry estimation, two-view line segment matching, and multiview 3D line mapping, all with excellent performance obtained. Based on the thorough evaluation, our ScaleLSD is observed to be the first deep approach that outperforms the pioneered non-deep LSD in all aspects we have tested, significantly expanding and reinforcing the versatility of the line geometry of images.

  _Junchao Zhou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision aimed at delineating object boundaries within images. Traditional approaches, such as edge detection and variational methods, have been widely explored, while recent advances in deep learning have shown promising results but often require extensive training data. In this work, we propose a novel variational framework for 2D image segmentation that integrates concepts from shape analysis and diffeomorphic transformations. Our method models segmentation as the deformation of a template curve via a diffeomorphic transformation of the image domain, using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework. The curve evolution is guided by a loss function that compares the deformed curve to the image gradient field, formulated through the varifold representation of geometric shapes. The approach is implemented in Python with GPU acceleration using the PyKeops library. This framework allows for accurate segmentation with a flexible and theoretically grounded methodology that does not rely on large datasets.

  Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, multimodal tasks have strongly advanced the field of action recognition with their rich multimodal information. However, due to the scarcity of tri-modal data, research on tri-modal action recognition tasks faces many challenges. To this end, we have proposed a comprehensive multimodal action recognition solution that effectively utilizes multimodal information. First, the existing data are transformed and expanded by optimizing data enhancement techniques to enlarge the training scale. At the same time, more RGB datasets are used to pre-train the backbone network, which is better adapted to the new task by means of transfer learning. Secondly, multimodal spatial features are extracted with the help of 2D CNNs and combined with the Temporal Shift Module (TSM) to achieve multimodal spatial-temporal feature extraction comparable to 3D CNNs and improve the computational efficiency. In addition, common prediction enhancement methods, such as Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA), Ensemble and Test-Time augmentation (TTA), are used to integrate the knowledge of models from different training periods of the same architecture and different architectures, so as to predict the actions from different perspectives and fully exploit the target information. Ultimately, we achieved the Top-1 accuracy of 99% and the Top-5 accuracy of 100% on the competition leaderboard, demonstrating the superiority of our solution.

  Correct use of electrical appliances has significantly improved human life quality. Unlike simple tools that can be manipulated with common sense, different parts of electrical appliances have specific functions defined by manufacturers. If we want the robot to heat bread by microwave, we should enable them to review the microwave manual first. From the manual, it can learn about component functions, interaction methods, and representative task steps about appliances. However, previous manual-related works remain limited to question-answering tasks while existing manipulation researchers ignore the manual's important role and fail to comprehend multi-page manuals. In this paper, we propose the first manual-based appliance manipulation benchmark CheckManual. Specifically, we design a large model-assisted human-revised data generation pipeline to create manuals based on CAD appliance models. With these manuals, we establish novel manual-based manipulation challenges, metrics, and simulator environments for model performance evaluation. Furthermore, we propose the first manual-based manipulation planning model ManualPlan to set up a group of baselines for the CheckManual benchmark.

  Remote sensing image interpretation plays a critical role in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, acquiring high-quality labeled data is often costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we proposes a multi-modal self-supervised learning framework that leverages high-resolution RGB images, multi-spectral data, and digital surface models (DSM) for pre-training. By designing an information-aware adaptive masking strategy, cross-modal masking mechanism, and multi-task self-supervised objectives, the framework effectively captures both the correlations across different modalities and the unique feature structures within each modality. We evaluated the proposed method on multiple downstream tasks, covering typical remote sensing applications such as scene classification, semantic segmentation, change detection, object detection, and depth estimation. Experiments are conducted on 15 remote sensing datasets, encompassing 26 tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing pretraining approaches in most tasks. Specifically, on the Potsdam and Vaihingen semantic segmentation tasks, our method achieved mIoU scores of 78.30\% and 76.50\%, with only 50\% train-set. For the US3D depth estimation task, the RMSE error is reduced to 0.182, and for the binary change detection task in SECOND dataset, our method achieved mIoU scores of 47.51\%, surpassing the second CS-MAE by 3 percentage points.

The YOLOv4-Tiny model was quantized to INT8 precision using TensorFlow Lite post-training quantization techniques and evaluated for detection speed, power consumption, and thermal feasibility under embedded deployment conditions. The quantized model achieved an inference time of 28.2 ms per image with an average power consumption of 13.85 W, demonstrating a significant reduction in power usage compared to its FP32 counterpart. Detection accuracy remained robust across key emergency classes such as Ambulance, Police, Fire Engine, and Car Crash.

  This paper presents a lightweight and energy-efficient object detection solution for aerial imagery captured during emergency response situations. We focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of 10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior works that rely on publicly available datasets, we created this dataset ourselves due to the lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery, making the dataset itself a key contribution of this work. The quantized model is evaluated against YOLOv5-small across multiple metrics, including mean Average Precision (mAP), F1 score, inference time, and model size. Experimental results demonstrate that the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny achieves comparable detection performance while reducing the model size from 22.5 MB to 6.4 MB and improving inference speed by 44\%. With a 71\% reduction in model size and a 44\% increase in inference speed, the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model proves highly suitable for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.

  Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification. Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow & Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and 6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and $68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial settings.

  Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance. Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability. Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As text-to-image models become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their equitable performance across diverse cultural contexts is critical. Efforts to mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, a novel evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe surpasses all baselines by 28% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two datasets for culturally universal concept, one comprising of T2I-generated outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges - especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex nature of attributes when evaluating bias.

  Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic, real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

  The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation. A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i) the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities, making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench, the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities (AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each, AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next generation of VFMs.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA, two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1 significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and captioning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries, such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries, enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget constraints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models, and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN, Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching, allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training cost.

  Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover, pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on popular CPath tasks, available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available:this https URL.

  Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals. Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models.

  Video content comprehension is essential for various applications, ranging from video analysis to interactive systems. Despite advancements in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), these models often struggle to capture the nuanced, spatiotemporal details essential for thorough video analysis. To address this gap, we introduce Video-CoT, a groundbreaking dataset designed to enhance spatiotemporal understanding using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodologies. Video-CoT contains 192,000 fine-grained spa-tiotemporal question-answer pairs and 23,000 high-quality CoT-annotated samples, providing a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video analysis capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in 2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct 3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.

  Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale, high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization. To alleviate this issue, we attempt to introduce the Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets into the SSS task since VFMs possess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (e.g., DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed module.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24 AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of 1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93). Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

  Achieving consistent color reproduction across multiple cameras is essential for seamless image fusion and Image Processing Pipeline (ISP) compatibility in modern devices, but it is a challenging task due to variations in sensors and optics. Existing raw-to-raw conversion methods face limitations such as poor adaptability to changing illumination, high computational costs, or impractical requirements such as simultaneous camera operation and overlapping fields-of-view. We introduce the Neural Physical Model (NPM), a lightweight, physically-informed approach that simulates raw images under specified illumination to estimate transformations between devices. The NPM effectively adapts to varying illumination conditions, can be initialized with physical measurements, and supports training with or without paired data. Experiments on public datasets like NUS and BeyondRGB demonstrate that NPM outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, providing robust chromatic consistency across different sensors and optical systems.

  Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction, overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type, which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions, without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

  Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.

  Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large, well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI, DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification. IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example, applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

  In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments, thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

  We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.

  Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment. When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead. We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models. Our codes are publicly available at \href{this https URL}

  Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text, enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an LLM.

  Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue, inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated filteringthis http URLaddition, to reduce the computation and increase the speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection, the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2, Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by 72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only 4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3 times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.

  We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.

  Creating recipe images is a key challenge in food computing, with applications in culinary education and multimodal recipe assistants. However, existing datasets lack fine-grained alignment between recipe goals, step-wise instructions, and visual content. We present RecipeGen, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for recipe-based Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Video (I2V), and Text-to-Video (T2V) generation. RecipeGen contains 26,453 recipes, 196,724 images, and 4,491 videos, covering diverse ingredients, cooking procedures, styles, and dish types. We further propose domain-specific evaluation metrics to assess ingredient fidelity and interaction modeling, benchmark representative T2I, I2V, and T2V models, and provide insights for future recipe generation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions. However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types, they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our code and relevant data as open-source atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Editing images with instructions to reflect non-rigid motions, camera viewpoint shifts, object deformations, human articulations, and complex interactions, poses a challenging yet underexplored problem in computer vision. Existing approaches and datasets predominantly focus on static scenes or rigid transformations, limiting their capacity to handle expressive edits involving dynamic motion. To address this gap, we introduce ByteMorph, a comprehensive framework for instruction-based image editing with an emphasis on non-rigid motions. ByteMorph comprises a large-scale dataset, ByteMorph-6M, and a strong baseline model built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), named ByteMorpher. ByteMorph-6M includes over 6 million high-resolution image editing pairs for training, along with a carefully curated evaluation benchmark ByteMorph-Bench. Both capture a wide variety of non-rigid motion types across diverse environments, human figures, and object categories. The dataset is constructed using motion-guided data generation, layered compositing techniques, and automated captioning to ensure diversity, realism, and semantic coherence. We further conduct a comprehensive evaluation of recent instruction-based image editing methods from both academic and commercial domains.

  In this report, we present a novel three-stage framework developed for the Ego4D Long-Term Action Anticipation (LTA) task. Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction, action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences. Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction. Our code will be released atthis https URL.

  Stroke rehabilitation often demands precise tracking of patient movements to monitor progress, with complexities of rehabilitation exercises presenting two critical challenges: fine-grained and sub-second (under one-second) action detection. In this work, we propose the High Resolution Temporal Transformer (HRTR), to time-localize and classify high-resolution (fine-grained), sub-second actions in a single-stage transformer, eliminating the need for multi-stage methods and post-processing. Without any refinements, HRTR outperforms state-of-the-art systems on both stroke related and general datasets, achieving Edit Score (ES) of 70.1 on StrokeRehab Video, 69.4 on StrokeRehab IMU, and 88.4 on 50Salads.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'), require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. In contrast, LLM-based methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with light wood furniture') but do not support editing, remain limited to rectangular layouts or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room boundaries that frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further introduce a novel voxelization-based evaluation that captures fine-grained geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass state-of-the-art on object addition while maintaining competitive results on full scene synthesis.

  Thermal infrared (TIR) object tracking often suffers from challenges such as target occlusion, motion blur, and background clutter, which significantly degrade the performance of trackers. To address these issues, this paper pro-poses a novel Siamese Motion Mamba Tracker (SMMT), which integrates a bidirectional state-space model and a self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce the Motion Mamba module into the Siamese architecture to ex-tract motion features and recover overlooked edge details using bidirectional modeling and self-attention. We propose a Siamese parameter-sharing strate-gy that allows certain convolutional layers to share weights. This approach reduces computational redundancy while preserving strong feature represen-tation. In addition, we design a motion edge-aware regression loss to improve tracking accuracy, especially for motion-blurred targets. Extensive experi-ments are conducted on four TIR tracking benchmarks, including LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR 2017. The results show that SMMT achieves superior performance in TIR target tracking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The diffusion-based adversarial purification methods attempt to drown adversarial perturbations into a part of isotropic noise through the forward process, and then recover the clean images through the reverse process. Due to the lack of distribution information about adversarial perturbations in the pixel domain, it is often unavoidable to damage normal semantics. We turn to the frequency domain perspective, decomposing the image into amplitude spectrum and phase spectrum. We find that for both spectra, the damage caused by adversarial perturbations tends to increase monotonically with frequency. This means that we can extract the content and structural information of the original clean sample from the frequency components that are less damaged. Meanwhile, theoretical analysis indicates that existing purification methods indiscriminately damage all frequency components, leading to excessive damage to the image. Therefore, we propose a purification method that can eliminate adversarial perturbations while maximizing the preservation of the content and structure of the original image. Specifically, at each time step during the reverse process, for the amplitude spectrum, we replace the low-frequency components of the estimated image's amplitude spectrum with the corresponding parts of the adversarial image. For the phase spectrum, we project the phase of the estimated image into a designated range of the adversarial image's phase spectrum, focusing on the low frequencies. Empirical evidence from extensive experiments demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms most current defense methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding actions within surgical workflows is critical for evaluating post-operative outcomes and enhancing surgical training and efficiency. Capturing and analyzing long sequences of actions in surgical settings is challenging due to the inherent variability in individual surgeon approaches, which are shaped by their expertise and preferences. This variability complicates the identification and segmentation of distinct actions with ambiguous boundary start and end points. The traditional models, such as MS-TCN, which rely on large receptive fields, that causes over-segmentation, or under-segmentation, where distinct actions are incorrectly aligned. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Stage Boundary-Aware Transformer Network (MSBATN) with hierarchical sliding window attention to improve action segmentation. Our approach effectively manages the complexity of varying action durations and subtle transitions by accurately identifying start and end action boundaries in untrimmed surgical videos. MSBATN introduces a novel unified loss function that optimises action classification and boundary detection as interconnected tasks. Unlike conventional binary boundary detection methods, our innovative boundary weighing mechanism leverages contextual information to precisely identify action boundaries. Extensive experiments on three challenging surgical datasets demonstrate that MSBATN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with superior F1 scores at 25% and 50%. thresholds and competitive results across other metrics.

  We present TerraMind, the first any-to-any generative, multimodal foundation model for Earth observation (EO). Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper studies optical flow estimation, a critical task in motion analysis with applications in autonomous navigation, action recognition, and film production. Traditional optical flow methods require consecutive frames, which are often unavailable due to limitations in data acquisition or real-world scene disruptions. Thus, single-frame optical flow estimation is emerging in the literature. However, existing single-frame approaches suffer from two major limitations: (1) they rely on labeled training data, making them task-specific, and (2) they produce deterministic predictions, failing to capture motion uncertainty. To overcome these challenges, we propose ProbDiffFlow, a training-free framework that estimates optical flow distributions from a single image. Instead of directly predicting motion, ProbDiffFlow follows an estimation-by-synthesis paradigm: it first generates diverse plausible future frames using a diffusion-based model, then estimates motion from these synthesized samples using a pre-trained optical flow model, and finally aggregates the results into a probabilistic flow distribution. This design eliminates the need for task-specific training while capturing multiple plausible motions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ProbDiffFlow achieves superior accuracy, diversity, and efficiency, outperforming existing single-image and two-frame baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing reliance on large-scale datasets in machine learning poses significant privacy and ethical challenges, particularly in sensitive domains such as face recognition (FR). Synthetic data generation offers a promising alternative; however, most existing methods depend heavily on external datasets or pre-trained models, increasing complexity and resource demands. In this paper, we introduce AugGen, a self-contained synthetic augmentation technique. AugGen strategically samples from a class-conditional generative model trained exclusively on the target FR dataset, eliminating the need for external resources. Evaluated across 8 FR benchmarks, including IJB-C and IJB-B, our method achieves 1-12% performance improvements, outperforming models trained solely on real data and surpassing state-of-the-art synthetic data generation approaches, while using less real data. Notably, these gains often exceed those from architectural modifications, underscoring the value of synthetic augmentation in data-limited scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that carefully integrated synthetic data can both mitigate privacy constraints and substantially enhance discriminative performance in face recognition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires not only question-based multimodal reasoning but also precise temporal grounding to capture subtle dynamics for accurate prediction. However, existing methods mainly use question information implicitly, limiting focus on question-specific details. Furthermore, most studies rely on uniform frame sampling, which can miss key question-relevant frames. Although recent Top-K frame selection methods aim to address this, their discrete nature still overlooks fine-grained temporal details. This paper proposes QA-TIGER, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates question information and models continuous temporal dynamics. Our key idea is to use Gaussian-based modeling to adaptively focus on both consecutive and non-consecutive frames based on the question, while explicitly injecting question information and applying progressive refinement. We leverage a Mixture of Experts (MoE) to flexibly implement multiple Gaussian models, activating temporal experts specifically tailored to the question. Extensive experiments on multiple AVQA benchmarks show that QA-TIGER consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available atthis https URL

  We introduce Spatial Reasoning Models (SRMs), a framework to perform reasoning over sets of continuous variables via denoising generative models. SRMs infer continuous representations on a set of unobserved variables, given observations on observed variables. Current generative models on spatial domains, such as diffusion and flow matching models, often collapse to hallucination in case of complex distributions. To measure this, we introduce a set of benchmark tasks that test the quality of complex reasoning in generative models and can quantify hallucination. The SRM framework allows to report key findings about importance of sequentialization in generation, the associated order, as well as the sampling strategies during training. It demonstrates, for the first time, that order of generation can successfully be predicted by the denoising network itself. Using these findings, we can increase the accuracy of specific reasoning tasks from <1% to >50%. Our project website provides additional videos, code, and the benchmark datasets:this https URL

  Reasoning over sequences of images remains a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent models incorporate multi-image data during pre-training, they still struggle to recognize sequential structures, often treating images independently. This work introduces ImageChain, a framework that enhances MLLMs with sequential reasoning capabilities over image data by modeling visual sequences as a multi-turn conversation. In ImageChain, images are interleaved with corresponding textual descriptions to form a controlled dialogue that explicitly captures temporal dependencies and narrative progression. Our method optimizes for the task of next-scene description, where the model generates a context-aware description of an upcoming scene based on preceding visual and textual cues. We demonstrate that our approach improves performance on the next-scene description task -- achieving an average improvement from 3.7% to 19% in SimRate, a metric that quantifies semantic similarity to human-annotated ground truths. Moreover, ImageChain achieves robust zero-shot out-of-domain performance in applications ranging from comics to robotics. Extensive experiments validate that instruction-tuning in a multimodal, multi-turn conversation design is key to bridging the gap between static image understanding and temporally-aware reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traveling waves of neural activity are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" problem -- which highlights how normal modes of wave dynamics encode geometric information -- we investigate whether similar principles can be leveraged in artificial neural networks. Specifically, we introduce convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli, enabling spatial integration. By then treating these wave-like activation sequences as visual representations themselves, we obtain a powerful representational space that outperforms local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, significantly outperforming local feed-forward models and rivaling non-local U-Net models with fewer parameters. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based communication and visual representation in artificial networks, our findings suggest wave-dynamics may provide efficiency and training stability benefits, while simultaneously offering a new framework for connecting models to biological recordings of neural activity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image restoration aims to recover details and enhance contrast in degraded images. With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmarks for image super-resolution, deraining, and low-light image enhancement demonstrate that TAMambaIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency, establishing it as a robust and efficient framework for image restoration.

  Cross-modal retrieval maps data under different modality via semantic relevance. Existing approaches implicitly assume that data pairs are well-aligned and ignore the widely existing annotation noise, i.e., noisy correspondence (NC). Consequently, it inevitably causes performance degradation. Despite attempts that employ the co-teaching paradigm with identical architectures to provide distinct data perspectives, the differences between these architectures are primarily stemmed from random initialization. Thus, the model becomes increasingly homogeneous along with the training process. Consequently, the additional information brought by this paradigm is severely limited. In order to resolve this problem, we introduce a Tripartite learning with Semantic Variation Consistency (TSVC) for robust image-text retrieval. We design a tripartite cooperative learning mechanism comprising a Coordinator, a Master, and an Assistant model. The Coordinator distributes data, and the Assistant model supports the Master model's noisy label prediction with diverse data. Moreover, we introduce a soft label estimation method based on mutual information variation, which quantifies the noise in new samples and assigns corresponding soft labels. We also present a new loss function to enhance robustness and optimize training effectiveness. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that, even at increasing noise ratios, TSVC exhibits significant advantages in retrieval accuracy and maintains stable training performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object removal has so far been dominated by the mask-and-inpaint paradigm, where the masked region is excluded from the input, leaving models relying on unmasked areas to inpaint the missing region. However, this approach lacks contextual information for the masked area, often resulting in unstable performance. In this work, we introduce SmartEraser, built with a new removing paradigm called Masked-Region Guidance. This paradigm retains the masked region in the input, using it as guidance for the removal process. It offers several distinct advantages: (a) it guides the model to accurately identify the object to be removed, preventing its regeneration in the output; (b) since the user mask often extends beyond the object itself, it aids in preserving the surrounding context in the final result. Leveraging this new paradigm, we present Syn4Removal, a large-scale object removal dataset, where instance segmentation data is used to copy and paste objects onto images as removal targets, with the original images serving as ground truths. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartEraser significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in object removal, especially in complex scenes with intricate compositions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models have enabled cost-effective video-editing applications by leveraging pre-trained models, eliminating the need for resource-intensive training. However, the frame-independence of T2I generation often results in poor temporal consistency. Existing methods address this issue through temporal layer fine-tuning or inference-based temporal propagation, but these approaches suffer from high training costs or limited temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality, text-image alignment, and temporal coherence, as demonstrated on the MSR-VTT dataset. Additionally, it achieves enhanced fidelity and frame-to-frame coherence, offering a practical solution for T2V editing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training vision-language models via instruction tuning often relies on large mixtures of data spanning diverse tasks and domains. However, these mixtures frequently include redundant information, increasing computational costs without proportional performance gains, necessitating more effective data selection strategies. Existing methods typically rely on task-agnostic heuristics to estimate data importance or focus on optimizing single tasks in isolation, limiting their effectiveness in multitask settings. In this work, we introduce ICONS, a gradient-based Influence CONsensus approach for vision-language data Selection. Our method leverages first-order training dynamics to estimate the influence of individual training examples on validation performance and aggregates these estimates across tasks via majority voting over task-specific influences. This cross-task consensus identifies data points that are consistently valuable across tasks, enabling us to prioritize examples that drive overall performance. The voting-based design further mitigates issues such as score calibration and outlier sensitivity, resulting in robust and scalable data selection for diverse multitask mixtures. With only 20% of the data from LLaVA-665K and Cambrian-7M, our selected subsets retain 98.6% and 98.8% of the performance achieved with full datasets, and can even surpass full data training at a 60% selection ratio on LLaVA-665K. Our approach also generalizes to unseen tasks and architectures, demonstrating strong transfer. We release two compact, high-utility subsets, LLaVA-ICONS-133K and Cambrian-ICONS-1.4M, preserving impactful training examples for efficient and scalable vision-language model development.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), are recent advancement of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that have driven major advances in video understanding. However, their vulnerability to adversarial tampering and manipulations remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{MVTamperBench}, a benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLM robustness against five prevalent tampering techniques: rotation, masking, substitution, repetition, and dropping; based on real-world visual tampering scenarios such as surveillance interference, social media content edits, and misinformation injection. MVTamperBench comprises ~3.4K original videos, expanded into over ~17K tampered clips covering 19 distinct video manipulation tasks. This benchmark challenges models to detect manipulations in spatial and temporal coherence. We evaluate 45 recent MLLMs from 15+ model families. We reveal substantial variability in resilience across tampering types and show that larger parameter counts do not necessarily guarantee robustness. MVTamperBench sets a new benchmark for developing tamper-resilient MLLM in safety-critical applications, including detecting clickbait, preventing harmful content distribution, and enforcing policies on media platforms. We release all code, data, and benchmark to foster open research in trustworthy video understanding.Code:this https URLData:this https URL

  Image tokenizers map images to sequences of discrete tokens, and are a crucial component of autoregressive transformer-based image generation. The tokens are typically associated with spatial locations in the input image, arranged in raster scan order, which is not ideal for autoregressive modeling. In this paper, we propose to tokenize the image spectrum instead, obtained from a discrete wavelet transform (DWT), such that the sequence of tokens represents the image in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Our tokenizer brings several advantages: 1) it leverages that natural images are more compressible at high frequencies, 2) it can take and reconstruct images of different resolutions without retraining, 3) it improves the conditioning for next-token prediction -- instead of conditioning on a partial line-by-line reconstruction of the image, it takes a coarse reconstruction of the full image, 4) it enables partial decoding where the first few generated tokens can reconstruct a coarse version of the image, 5) it enables autoregressive models to be used for image upsampling. We evaluate the tokenizer reconstruction metrics as well as multiscale image generation, text-guided image upsampling and editing.

  _Jingming Liu, Yumeng Li, Boyuan Xiao, Yichang Jian, Ziang Qin, Tianjia Shao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Under pure textual modality, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks by decomposing them into simpler sub-problems. However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle with some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solving jigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of visual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived from the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and generating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the perceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion process, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because it repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an approach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual inputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate visual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual modification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve tasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that closed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the visual reasoning task into solvable substeps.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing approaches to drone visual geo-localization predominantly adopt the image-based setting, where a single drone-view snapshot is matched with images from other platforms. Such task formulation, however, underutilizes the inherent video output of the drone and is sensitive to occlusions and viewpoint disparity. To address these limitations, we formulate a new video-based drone geo-localization task and propose the Video2BEV paradigm. This paradigm transforms the video into a Bird's Eye View (BEV), simplifying the subsequent \textbf{inter-platform} matching process. In particular, we employ Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct a 3D scene and obtain the BEV projection. Different from the existing transform methods, \eg, polar transform, our BEVs preserve more fine-grained details without significant distortion. To facilitate the discriminative \textbf{intra-platform} representation learning, our Video2BEV paradigm also incorporates a diffusion-based module for generating hard negative samples. To validate our approach, we introduce UniV, a new video-based geo-localization dataset that extends the image-based University-1652 dataset. UniV features flight paths at $30^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ elevation angles with increased frame rates of up to 10 frames per second (FPS). Extensive experiments on the UniV dataset show that our Video2BEV paradigm achieves competitive recall rates and outperforms conventional video-based methods. Compared to other competitive methods, our proposed approach exhibits robustness at lower elevations with more occlusions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Negative Prompting (NP) is widely utilized in diffusion models, particularly in text-to-image applications, to prevent the generation of undesired features. In this paper, we show that conventional NP is limited by the assumption of a constant guidance scale, which may lead to highly suboptimal results, or even complete failure, due to the non-stationarity and state-dependence of the reverse process. Based on this analysis, we derive a principled technique called Dynamic Negative Guidance, which relies on a near-optimal time and state dependent modulation of the guidance without requiring additional training. Unlike NP, negative guidance requires estimating the posterior class probability during the denoising process, which is achieved with limited additional computational overhead by tracking the discrete Markov Chain during the generative process. We evaluate the performance of DNG class-removal on MNIST and CIFAR10, where we show that DNG leads to higher safety, preservation of class balance and image quality when compared with baseline methods. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to use DNG with Stable Diffusion to obtain more accurate and less invasive guidance than NP.

  Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently exhibited impressive general-purpose capabilities by leveraging vision foundation models to encode the core concepts of images into representations. These are then combined with instructions and processed by the language model to generate high-quality responses. Despite significant progress in enhancing the language component, challenges persist in optimally fusing visual encodings within the language model for task-specific adaptability. Recent research has focused on improving this fusion through modality adaptation modules but at the cost of significantly increased model complexity and training data needs. In this paper, we propose EMMA (Efficient Multi-Modal Adaptation), a lightweight cross-modality module designed to efficiently fuse visual and textual encodings, generating instruction-aware visual representations for the language model. Our key contributions include: (1) an efficient early fusion mechanism that integrates vision and language representations with minimal added parameters (less than 0.2% increase in model size), (2) an in-depth interpretability analysis that sheds light on the internal mechanisms of the proposed method; (3) comprehensive experiments that demonstrate notable improvements on both specialized and general benchmarks for MLLMs. Empirical results show that EMMA boosts performance across multiple tasks by up to 9.3% while significantly improving robustness against hallucinations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Character video synthesis aims to produce realistic videos of animatable characters within lifelike scenes. As a fundamental problem in the computer vision and graphics community, 3D works typically require multi-view captures for per-case training, which severely limits their applicability of modeling arbitrary characters in a short time. Recent 2D methods break this limitation via pre-trained diffusion models, but they struggle for pose generality and scene interaction. To this end, we propose MIMO, a novel framework which can not only synthesize character videos with controllable attributes (i.e., character, motion and scene) provided by simple user inputs, but also simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality to novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a unified framework. The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial codes, considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Concretely, we lift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators, and decompose the video clip to three spatial components (i.e., main human, underlying scene, and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the 3D depth. These components are further encoded to canonical identity code, structured motion code and full scene code, which are utilized as control signals of synthesis process. The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables flexible user control, complex motion expression, as well as 3D-aware synthesis for scene interactions. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate uncertainty estimation is a critical challenge in open-set recognition, where a probe biometric sample may belong to an unknown identity. It can be addressed through sample quality estimation via probabilistic embeddings. However, the low variance of probabilistic embedding only partly implies a low identification error probability: an embedding of a sample could be close to several classes in a gallery, thus yielding high uncertainty despite high sample quality. We propose HolUE - a holistic uncertainty estimation method based on a Bayesian probabilistic model; it is aware of two sources of ambiguity in the open-set recognition system: (1) the gallery uncertainty caused by overlapping classes and (2) the uncertainty of embeddings. Challenging open-set recognition datasets, such as IJB-C for the image domain and VoxBlink for the audio domain, serve as a testbed for our method. We also provide a new open-set recognition protocol for the identification of whales and dolphins. In all cases, HolUE better identifies recognition errors than alternative uncertainty estimation methods, including those based solely on sample quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent works are restricted to specific hardware setups, either on only low-cost or on only high-end configurations. Approaches aimed at reducing 3DGS memory usage enable rendering on low-cost GPU but compromise rendering quality, which fails to leverage the hardware capabilities in the case of higher-end GPU. Conversely, methods that enhance rendering quality require high-end GPU with large VRAM, making such methods impractical for lower-end devices with limited memory capacity. Consequently, 3DGS-based works generally assume a single hardware setup and lack the flexibility to adapt to varying hardware constraints.To overcome this limitation, we propose Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) for 3DGS. FLoD constructs a multi-level 3DGS representation through level-specific 3D scale constraints, where each level independently reconstructs the entire scene with varying detail and GPU memory usage. A level-by-level training strategy is introduced to ensure structural consistency across levels. Furthermore, the multi-level structure of FLoD allows selective rendering of image regions at different detail levels, providing additional memory-efficient rendering options. To our knowledge, among prior works which incorporate the concept of Level of Detail (LoD) with 3DGS, FLoD is the first to follow the core principle of LoD by offering adjustable options for a broad range of GPU settings.Experiments demonstrate that FLoD provides various rendering options with trade-offs between quality and memory usage, enabling real-time rendering under diverse memory constraints. Furthermore, we show that FLoD generalizes to different 3DGS frameworks, indicating its potential for integration into future state-of-the-art developments.

  Humor, deeply rooted in societal meanings and cultural details, poses a unique challenge for machines. While advances have been made in natural language processing, real-world humor often thrives in a multi-modal context, encapsulated distinctively by memes. This paper poses a particular emphasis on the impact of multi-images on meme captioning. After that, we introduce the \textsc{XMeCap} framework, a novel approach that adopts supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning based on an innovative reward model, which factors in both global and local similarities between visuals and text. Our results, benchmarked against contemporary models, manifest a marked improvement in caption generation for both single-image and multi-image memes, as well as different meme categories. \textsc{XMeCap} achieves an average evaluation score of 75.85 for single-image memes and 66.32 for multi-image memes, outperforming the best baseline by 6.75\% and 8.56\%, respectively. This research not only establishes a new frontier in meme-related studies but also underscores the potential of machines in understanding and generating humor in a multi-modal setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D object detection is an important task that has been widely applied in autonomous driving. To perform this task, a new trend is to fuse multi-modal inputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera. Under such a trend, recent methods fuse these two modalities by unifying them in the same 3D space. However, during direct fusion in a unified space, the drawbacks of both modalities (LiDAR features struggle with detailed semantic information and the camera lacks accurate 3D spatial information) are also preserved, diluting semantic and spatial awareness of the final unified representation. To address the issue, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary LiDAR-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to fuse LiDAR and camera features in a bidirectional complementary way to enhance the semantic awareness of the LiDAR and the 3D spatial awareness of the camera. The enhanced features from both modalities are then adaptively fused to build a semantic- and spatial-aware unified representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantic awareness of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the 3D spatial awareness of camera features from 3D voxel features. We then introduce Unified Fusion (U-Fusion) to adaptively fuse the enhanced features from the last stage to build a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts. Project page:this https URL.

  Real-world application models are commonly deployed in dynamic environments, where the target domain distribution undergoes temporal changes. Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) has recently emerged as a promising technique to gradually adapt a source-trained model to continually changing target domains. Despite recent advancements in addressing CTTA, two critical issues remain: 1) Fixed thresholds for pseudo-labeling in existing methodologies lead to low-quality pseudo-labels, as model confidence varies across categories and domains; 2) Stochastic parameter restoration methods for mitigating catastrophic forgetting fail to preserve critical information effectively, due to their intrinsic randomness. To tackle these challenges for detection models in CTTA scenarios, we present AMROD, featuring three core components. Firstly, the object-level contrastive learning module extracts object-level features for contrastive learning to refine the feature representation in the target domain. Secondly, the adaptive monitoring module dynamically skips unnecessary adaptation and updates the category-specific threshold based on predicted confidence scores to enable efficiency and improve the quality of pseudo-labels. Lastly, the adaptive randomized restoration mechanism selectively reset inactive parameters with higher possibilities, ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMROD on four CTTA object detection tasks, where AMROD outperforms existing methods, especially achieving a 3.2 mAP improvement and a 20\% increase in efficiency on the Cityscapes-to-Cityscapes-C CTTA task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer architectures depend on explicit position encodings to capture token positional information. Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) has emerged as a popular choice in language models due to its efficient encoding of relative position information through key-query rotations. However, RoPE faces significant limitations beyond language processing: it is constrained to one-dimensional sequence data and, even with learnable phases, offers limited representational capacity. We address these challenges with Lie Relative Encodings (LieRE), which generalizes RoPE to high-dimensional rotation matrices by leveraging their Lie group structure. Through extensive evaluation on three image datasets across 2D and 3D classification tasks, LieRE achieves 1.5% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines on 2D tasks and 1% on 3D tasks, while demonstrating superior generalization to higher resolutions. Our implementation is computationally efficient, with results reproducible on 4 A100 GPUs in 30 minutes on CIFAR100. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Visual anomaly detection (AD) presents significant challenges due to the scarcity of anomalous data samples. While numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, these synthetic anomalies often lack authenticity or require extensive training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Anomaly Anything (AnomalyAny), a novel framework that leverages Stable Diffusion (SD)'s image generation capabilities to generate diverse and realistic unseen anomalies. By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate AnomalyAny's ability in generating high-quality unseen anomalies and its effectiveness in enhancing downstream AD performance.

  Text-Centric Visual Question Answering (TEC-VQA) in its proper format not only facilitates human-machine interaction in text-centric visual environments but also serves as a de facto gold proxy to evaluate AI models in the domain of text-centric scene understanding. Nonetheless, most existing TEC-VQA benchmarks have focused on high-resource languages like English and Chinese. Despite pioneering works to expand multilingual QA pairs in non-text-centric VQA datasets through translation engines, the translation-based protocol encounters a substantial "visual-textual misalignment" problem when applied to TEC-VQA. Specifically, it prioritizes the text in question-answer pairs while disregarding the visual text present in images. Moreover, it fails to address complexities related to nuanced meaning, contextual distortion, language bias, and question-type diversity. In this work, we tackle multilingual TEC-VQA by introducing MTVQA, the first benchmark featuring high-quality human expert annotations across 9 diverse languages, consisting of 6,778 question-answer pairs across 2,116 images. Further, by comprehensively evaluating numerous state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models~(MLLMs), including Qwen2-VL, GPT-4o, GPT-4V, Claude3, and Gemini, on the MTVQA benchmark, it is evident that there is still a large room for performance improvement (Qwen2-VL scoring 30.9 versus 79.7 for human performance), underscoring the value of MTVQA. Additionally, we supply multilingual training data within the MTVQA dataset, demonstrating that straightforward fine-tuning with this data can substantially enhance multilingual TEC-VQA performance. We aspire that MTVQA will offer the research community fresh insights and stimulate further exploration in multilingual visual text comprehension. The project homepage is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-centric visual question answering (VQA) has made great strides with the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet open-source models still fall short of leading models like GPT4V and Gemini, partly due to a lack of extensive, high-quality instruction tuning data. To this end, we introduce a new approach for creating a massive, high-quality instruction-tuning dataset, Square-10M, which is generated using closed-source MLLMs. The data construction process, termed Square, consists of four steps: Self-Questioning, Answering, Reasoning, and Evaluation. Our experiments with Square-10M led to three key findings: 1) Our model, TextSquare, considerably surpasses open-source previous state-of-the-art Text-centric MLLMs and sets a new standard on OCRBench(62.2%). It even outperforms top-tier models like GPT4V and Gemini in 6 of 10 text-centric benchmarks. 2) Additionally, we demonstrate the critical role of VQA reasoning data in offering comprehensive contextual insights for specific questions. This not only improves accuracy but also significantly mitigates hallucinations. Specifically, TextSquare scores an average of 75.1% across four general VQA and hallucination evaluation datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models. 3) Notably, the phenomenon observed in scaling text-centric VQA datasets reveals a vivid pattern: the exponential increase of instruction tuning data volume is directly proportional to the improvement in model performance, thereby validating the necessity of the dataset scale and the high quality of Square-10M.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have allowed recent LLM-based approaches to achieve excellent performance on long-video understanding benchmarks. We investigate how extensive world knowledge and strong reasoning skills of underlying LLMs influence this strong performance. Surprisingly, we discover that LLM-based approaches can yield surprisingly good accuracy on long-video tasks with limited video information, sometimes even with no video specific information. Building on this, we explore injecting video-specific information into an LLM-based framework. We utilize off-the-shelf vision tools to extract three object-centric information modalities from videos, and then leverage natural language as a medium for fusing this information. Our resulting Multimodal Video Understanding (MVU) framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks. Strong performance also on robotics domain tasks establish its strong generality. Code:this https URL

  Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains.

  Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability distributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate faithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations, and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive Large Language Models (AR-LLMs) frequently exhibit implicit parallelism in sequential generation. Inspired by this, we introduce Multiverse, a new generative model that enables natively parallel generation. Multiverse internalizes a MapReduce paradigm, generating automatically through three stages: (i) a Map stage for adaptive task decomposition, (ii) a Process stage for parallel subtask execution, and (iii) a Reduce stage for lossless result synthesis. Next, we build a real-world Multiverse reasoning model with co-design of data, algorithm, and system, enabling rapid and seamless transfer from frontier AR-LLMs. Starting from sequential reasoning chains, we create Multiverse 1K by converting them into structured training data using an automated LLM-assisted pipeline, avoiding costly human annotations. Algorithmically, we design Multiverse Attention to separate parallel reasoning steps while keeping compatibility with causal attention for efficient training. Systematically, we implement Multiverse Engine to enable parallel inference. It features a dedicated scheduler that dynamically switches between sequential and parallel generation, triggered directly by the model. After a 3-hour fine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only open-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of the same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively. Moreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits superior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same context length. Such scaling further leads to practical efficiency gain, achieving up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes. We have open-sourced the entire Multiverse ecosystem, including data, model weights, engine, supporting tools, as well as complete data curation prompts and detailed training and evaluation recipes.

  Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM features preserve essential categorical information while discarding non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that can drive robust representation learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to update Machine Learning (ML) models following requests to remove training samples and their influences on a trained model efficiently without retraining the original ML model from scratch. While MU itself has been employed to provide privacy protection and regulatory compliance, it can also increase the attack surface of the model. Existing privacy inference attacks towards MU that aim to infer properties of the unlearned set rely on the weaker threat model that assumes the attacker has access to both the unlearned model and the original model, limiting their feasibility toward real-life scenarios. We propose a novel privacy attack, A Posteriori Label-Only Membership Inference Attack towards MU, Apollo, that infers whether a data sample has been unlearned, following a strict threat model where an adversary has access to the label-output of the unlearned model only. We demonstrate that our proposed attack, while requiring less access to the target model compared to previous attacks, can achieve relatively high precision on the membership status of the unlearned samples.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we provide an extended discussion of a new approach to explainable Reinforcement Learning called Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (DNA), first proposed at L4DC 2025. DNA seeks a set of reasonable "options" for trajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively diverse trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these distinct policies are used to "explain" an agent's options in terms of available trajectory shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular, DNA applies to value function-based policies on Markov decision processes where agents are limited to continuous trajectories. Here, we describe DNA, which uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems to solve for distinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality. We show that it successfully returns qualitatively different policies that constitute meaningfully different "options" in simulation, including a brief comparison to related approaches in the stochastic optimization field of Quality Diversity. Beyond the explanatory motivation, this work opens new possibilities for exploration and adaptive planning in RL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Having designed a VQVAE that maps digital radio waveforms into discrete latent space, and yields a perfectly classifiable reconstruction of the original data, we here analyze the attack suppressing properties of VQVAE when an adversarial attack is performed on high-SNR radio-frequency (RF) data-points. To target amplitude modulations from a subset of digitally modulated waveform classes, we first create adversarial attacks that preserve the phase between the in-phase and quadrature component whose values are adversarially changed. We compare them with adversarial attacks of the same intensity where phase is not preserved. We test the classification accuracy of such adversarial examples on a classifier trained to deliver 100% accuracy on the original data. To assess the ability of VQVAE to suppress the strength of the attack, we evaluate the classifier accuracy on the reconstructions by VQVAE of the adversarial datapoints and show that VQVAE substantially decreases the effectiveness of the attack. We also compare the I/Q plane diagram of the attacked data, their reconstructions and the original data. Finally, using multiple methods and metrics, we compare the probability distribution of the VQVAE latent space with and without attack. Varying the attack strength, we observe interesting properties of the discrete space, which may help detect the attacks.

  _Amit Baran Dey, Wasim Arif, Rakhesh Singh Kshetrimayum_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a machine learning-based methodology for the classification of various oil samples based on their dielectric properties, utilizing a microwave resonant sensor. The dielectric behaviour of oils, governed by their molecular composition, induces distinct shifts in the sensor's resonant frequency and amplitude response. These variations are systematically captured and processed to extract salient features, which serve as inputs for multiple machine learning classifiers. The microwave resonant sensor operates in a non-destructive, low-power manner, making it particularly well-suited for real-time industrial applications. A comprehensive dataset is developed by varying the permittivity of oil samples and acquiring the corresponding sensor responses. Several classifiers are trained and evaluated using the extracted resonant features to assess their capability in distinguishing between oil types. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a high classification accuracy of 99.41% with the random forest classifier, highlighting its strong potential for automated oil identification. The system's compact form factor, efficiency, and high performance underscore its viability for fast and reliable oil characterization in industrial environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple data holders to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their training data with external parties. In this paradigm, workers locally update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or model parameters). While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine) participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming model convergence. Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent. Towards this purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation, assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than honest gradients do from each other. However, in heterogeneous settings, honest gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest outliers from Byzantine ones. In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines' gradients. This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamical systems modeling is a core pillar of scientific inquiry across natural and life sciences. Increasingly, dynamical system models are learned from data, rendering identifiability a paramount concept. For systems that are not identifiable from data, no guarantees can be given about their behavior under new conditions and inputs, or about possible control mechanisms to steer the system. It is known in the community that "linear ordinary differential equations (ODE) are almost surely identifiable from a single trajectory." However, this only holds for dense matrices. The sparse regime remains underexplored, despite its practical relevance with sparsity arising naturally in many biological, social, and physical systems. In this work, we address this gap by characterizing the identifiability of sparse linear ODEs. Contrary to the dense case, we show that sparse systems are unidentifiable with a positive probability in practically relevant sparsity regimes and provide lower bounds for this probability. We further study empirically how this theoretical unidentifiability manifests in state-of-the-art methods to estimate linear ODEs from data. Our results corroborate that sparse systems are also practically unidentifiable. Theoretical limitations are not resolved through inductive biases or optimization dynamics. Our findings call for rethinking what can be expected from data-driven dynamical system modeling and allows for quantitative assessments of how much to trust a learned linear ODE.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains, remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data}, which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures} between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes Load-aware Tram-FL, an extension of Tram-FL that introduces a training scheduling mechanism to minimize total training time in decentralized federated learning by accounting for both computational and communication loads. The scheduling problem is formulated as a global optimization task, which-though intractable in its original form-is made solvable by decomposing it into node-wise subproblems. To promote balanced data utilization under non-IID distributions, a variance constraint is introduced, while the overall training latency, including both computation and communication costs, is minimized through the objective function. Simulation results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that Load-aware Tram-FL significantly reduces training time and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps: Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis, and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general. The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.

  Multi-modal graphs, which integrate diverse multi-modal features and relations, are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However, existing multi-modal graph learning methods are typically trained from scratch for specific graph data and tasks, failing to generalize across various multi-modal graph data and tasks. To bridge this gap, we explore the potential of Multi-modal Graph Large Language Models (MG-LLM) to unify and generalize across diverse multi-modal graph data and tasks. We propose a unified framework of multi-modal graph data, task, and model, discovering the inherent multi-granularity and multi-scale characteristics in multi-modal graphs. Specifically, we present five key desired characteristics for MG-LLM: 1) unified space for multi-modal structures and attributes, 2) capability of handling diverse multi-modal graph tasks, 3) multi-modal graph in-context learning, 4) multi-modal graph interaction with natural language, and 5) multi-modal graph reasoning. We then elaborate on the key challenges, review related works, and highlight promising future research directions towards realizing these ambitious characteristics. Finally, we summarize existing multi-modal graph datasets pertinent for model training. We believe this paper can contribute to the ongoing advancement of the research towards MG-LLM for generalization across multi-modal graph data and tasks.

  Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation quality. In this work, we introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. ACNs showcase a unique property we coin as "auto-compression", the ability of a network to organically compress information during training with gradient descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression, information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training, enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to 18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling ACNs with traditional pruning techniques, enables significantly better sparsity-performance trade-offs compared to conventional architectures. These findings establish ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while learning robust representations.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved impressive results across a variety of generative and classification tasks. However, they remain fundamentally ill-equipped to ensure that their outputs satisfy temporal constraints, such as those expressible in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). In this paper, we introduce TRIDENT: a general and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with such constraints without requiring any retraining. TRIDENT compiles LTLf formulas into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which is used to guide a constrained variant of beam search. At each decoding step, transitions that would lead to constraint violations are masked, while remaining paths are dynamically re-ranked based on both the model's probabilities and the DFA's acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are guaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically demonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach on two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and controlled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect constraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows improved efficiency and high standard quality metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to model relational information using machine learning has driven advancements across various domains, from medicine to social science. While graph representation learning has become mainstream over the past decade, representing higher-order relationships through hypergraphs is rapidly gaining momentum. In the last few years, numerous hypergraph neural networks have emerged, most of them falling under a two-stage, set-based framework. The messages are sent from nodes to edges and then from edges to nodes. However, most of the advancement still takes inspiration from the graph counterpart, often simplifying the aggregations to basic pooling operations. In this paper we are introducing Wasserstein Hypergraph Neural Network, a model that treats the nodes and hyperedge neighbourhood as distributions and aggregate the information using Sliced Wasserstein Pooling. Unlike conventional aggregators such as mean or sum, which only capture first-order statistics, our approach has the ability to preserve geometric properties like the shape and spread of distributions. This enables the learned embeddings to reflect how easily one hyperedge distribution can be transformed into another, following principles of optimal transport. Experimental results demonstrate that applying Wasserstein pooling in a hypergraph setting significantly benefits node classification tasks, achieving top performance on several real-world datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, the presence of anomalous or corrupted clients - such as those with faulty sensors or non representative data distributions - can significantly degrade model performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection, WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in cross-modal understanding and generation by integrating visual and textual information. While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing approaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in domains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have introduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these privacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain lacking. In this work, we present \textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic benchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two mainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning strategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four cross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings, covering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive experiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM architectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task federated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal configuration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in vision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and encoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools, datasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a standardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of multimodal foundation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for synthetic tabular data generation through in-context learning (ICL), offering a practical solution for data augmentation in data scarce scenarios. While prior work has shown the potential of LLMs to improve downstream task performance through augmenting underrepresented groups, these benefits often assume access to a subset of unbiased in-context examples, representative of the real dataset. In real-world settings, however, data is frequently noisy and demographically skewed. In this paper, we systematically study how statistical biases within in-context examples propagate to the distribution of synthetic tabular data, showing that even mild in-context biases lead to global statistical distortions. We further introduce an adversarial scenario where a malicious contributor can inject bias into the synthetic dataset via a subset of in-context examples, ultimately compromising the fairness of downstream classifiers for a targeted and protected subgroup. Our findings demonstrate a new vulnerability associated with LLM-based data generation pipelines that rely on in-context prompts with in sensitive domains.

  We propose, implement, and compare with competitors a new architecture of equivariant neural networks based on geometric (Clifford) algebras: Generalized Lipschitz Group Equivariant Neural Networks (GLGENN). These networks are equivariant to all pseudo-orthogonal transformations, including rotations and reflections, of a vector space with any non-degenerate or degenerate symmetric bilinear form. We propose a weight-sharing parametrization technique that takes into account the fundamental structures and operations of geometric algebras. Due to this technique, GLGENN architecture is parameter-light and has less tendency to overfitting than baseline equivariant models. GLGENN outperforms or matches competitors on several benchmarking equivariant tasks, including estimation of an equivariant function and a convex hull experiment, while using significantly fewer optimizable parameters.

  State-space language models such as Mamba match Transformer quality while permitting linear complexity inference, yet still comprise billions of parameters that hinder deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods are tailored to attention blocks and fail to account for the time-shared and discretized state-transition matrix at the heart of the selective state-space module (SSM). In this paper, we introduce SparseSSM, the first training-free pruning framework that extends the classic optimal brain surgeon (OBS) framework to state space architectures. Our layer-wise algorithm (i) derives an approximate second-order saliency score that aggregates Hessian-trace information across time steps, (ii) incorporates a component sensitivity analysis to guide feed-forward network (FFN) pruning, which also sheds light on where redundancy resides in mamba architecture, (iii) can be easily extended to semi-structured and structured sparsity. Empirically, we prune 50% of SSM weights without fine-tuning and observe no zero-shot accuracy loss, achieving the current state-of-the-art pruning algorithm for Mamba-based LLMs.

  Currently, existing tensor recovery methods fail to recognize the impact of tensor scale variations on their structural characteristics. Furthermore, existing studies face prohibitive computational costs when dealing with large-scale high-order tensor data. To alleviate these issue, assisted by the Krylov subspace iteration, block Lanczos bidiagonalization process, and random projection strategies, this article first devises two fast and accurate randomized algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) problem. Theoretical bounds on the accuracy of the approximation error estimate are established. Next, we develop a novel generalized nonconvex modeling framework tailored to large-scale tensor recovery, in which a new regularization paradigm is exploited to achieve insightful prior representation for large-scale tensors. On the basis of the above, we further investigate new unified nonconvex models and efficient optimization algorithms, respectively, for several typical high-order tensor recovery tasks in unquantized and quantized situations. To render the proposed algorithms practical and efficient for large-scale tensor data, the proposed randomized LRTA schemes are integrated into their central and time-intensive computations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various large-scale tensors, whose results demonstrate the practicability, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.

  Reliable uncertainty calibration is essential for safely deploying deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. Deep neural networks are known to exhibit systematic overconfidence, especially under distribution shifts. Although foundation models such as ConvNeXt, EVA and BEiT have demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance, their calibration properties remain underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the calibration behavior of foundation models, revealing insights that challenge established paradigms. Our empirical analysis shows that these models tend to be underconfident in in-distribution predictions, resulting in higher calibration errors, while demonstrating improved calibration under distribution shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that foundation models are highly responsive to post-hoc calibration techniques in the in-distribution setting, enabling practitioners to effectively mitigate underconfidence bias. However, these methods become progressively less reliable under severe distribution shifts and can occasionally produce counterproductive results. Our findings highlight the complex, non-monotonic effects of architectural and training innovations on calibration, challenging established narratives of continuous improvement.

  Sample efficiency and exploration remain critical challenges in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), particularly in complex domains. Offline RL, which enables agents to learn optimal policies from static, pre-collected datasets, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, offline RL is constrained by issues such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions that limit policy performance and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Meta Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning (MOORL), a hybrid framework that unifies offline and online RL for efficient and scalable learning. While previous hybrid methods rely on extensive design components and added computational complexity to utilize offline data effectively, MOORL introduces a meta-policy that seamlessly adapts across offline and online trajectories. This enables the agent to leverage offline data for robust initialization while utilizing online interactions to drive efficient exploration. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach enhances exploration by effectively combining the complementary strengths of offline and online data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOORL learns a stable Q-function without added complexity. Extensive experiments on 28 tasks from the D4RL and V-D4RL benchmarks validate its effectiveness, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art offline and hybrid RL baselines. With minimal computational overhead, MOORL achieves strong performance, underscoring its potential for practical applications in real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs) for a new reward-free Markov Decision Process. Rather than a value function, OKBEs directly construct and optimize a predictive map called a state-time option kernel (STOK) to maximize the probability of completing a goal while avoiding constraint violations. STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable initiation-to-termination transition kernels for policies in the Options Framework of Reinforcement Learning. This means: 1) STOKs can be composed using Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to make spatiotemporal predictions for multiple policies over long horizons, 2) high-dimensional STOKs can be represented and computed efficiently in a factorized and reconfigurable form, and 3) STOKs record the probabilities of semantically interpretable goal-success and constraint-violation events, needed for formal verification. Given a high-dimensional state-transition model for an intractable planning problem, we can decompose it with local STOKs and goal-conditioned policies that are aggregated into a factorized goal kernel, making it possible to forward-plan at the level of goals in high-dimensions to solve the problem. These properties lead to highly flexible agents that can rapidly synthesize meta-policies, reuse planning representations across many tasks, and justify goals using empowerment, an intrinsic motivation function. We argue that reward-maximization is in conflict with the properties of compositionality, modularity, and interpretability. Alternatively, OKBEs facilitate these properties to support verifiable long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation that scales to dynamic high-dimensional world-models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Designing protein sequences with optimal energetic stability is a key challenge in protein inverse folding, as current deep learning methods are primarily trained by maximizing sequence recovery rates, often neglecting the energy of the generated sequences. This work aims to overcome this limitation by developing a model that directly generates low-energy, stable protein sequences. We propose EnerBridge-DPO, a novel inverse folding framework focused on generating low-energy, high-stability protein sequences. Our core innovation lies in: First, integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), where energy-based preferences are used to fine-tune the Markov Bridge model. The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior sequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence candidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which enhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the model to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior knowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing quantitative features of the energy landscape. Our evaluations demonstrate that EnerBridge-DPO can design protein complex sequences with lower energy while maintaining sequence recovery rates comparable to state-of-the-art models, and accurately predicts $\Delta \Delta G$ values between various sequences.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We point out a few pitfalls in implementing gradient estimation for KL divergence in RL training for LLM, as seen in a number of open source projects and papers. The first major pitfall is to differentiate through the KL estimate as loss functions to minimize KL divergence. We show that such implementations are generally incorrect and do not produce the desired KL gradient. Secondly, we show that some implementations do not account for the sequential nature of the estimation problem and produce a partial gradient at best. We demonstrate the impact of such issues with illustrative tabular and LLM experiments, and show the correct way to implement the KL gradient.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ranking tasks constitute fundamental components of extreme similarity learning frameworks, where extremely large corpora of objects are modeled through relative similarity relationships adhering to predefined ordinal structures. Among various ranking surrogates, Softmax (SM) Loss has been widely adopted due to its natural capability to handle listwise ranking via global negative comparisons, along with its flexibility across diverse application scenarios. However, despite its effectiveness, SM Loss often suffers from significant computational overhead and scalability limitations when applied to large-scale object spaces. To address this challenge, we propose novel loss formulations that align directly with ranking metrics: the Ranking-Generalizable \textbf{squared} (RG$^2$) Loss and the Ranking-Generalizable interactive (RG$^\times$) Loss, both derived through Taylor expansions of the SM Loss. Notably, RG$^2$ reveals the intrinsic mechanisms underlying weighted squared losses (WSL) in ranking methods and uncovers fundamental connections between sampling-based and non-sampling-based loss paradigms. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed RG losses with the highly efficient Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method, providing both generalization guarantees and convergence rate analyses. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable or superior ranking performance relative to SM Loss, while significantly accelerating convergence. This framework offers the similarity learning community both theoretical insights and practically efficient tools, with methodologies applicable to a broad range of tasks where balancing ranking quality and computational efficiency is essential.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language modeling, recent studies reveal that they often fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples due to spurious correlations acquired during pre-training. Here, we aim to mitigate such spurious correlations through causality-aware post-training (CAPT). By decomposing a biased prediction into two unbiased steps, known as \textit{event estimation} and \textit{event intervention}, we reduce LLMs' pre-training biases without incurring additional fine-tuning biases, thus enhancing the model's generalization ability. Experiments on the formal causal inference benchmark CLadder and the logical reasoning dataset PrOntoQA show that 3B-scale language models fine-tuned with CAPT can outperform both traditional SFT and larger LLMs on in-distribution (ID) and OOD tasks using only 100 ID fine-tuning samples, demonstrating the effectiveness and sample efficiency of CAPT.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion distillation is a widely used technique to reduce the sampling cost of diffusion models, yet it often requires extensive training, and the student performance tends to be degraded. Recent studies show that incorporating a GAN objective may alleviate these issues, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we first identify a key limitation of distillation: mismatched step sizes and parameter numbers between the teacher and the student model lead them to converge to different local minima, rendering direct imitation suboptimal. We further demonstrate that a standalone GAN objective, without relying a distillation loss, overcomes this limitation and is sufficient to convert diffusion models into efficient one-step generators. Based on this finding, we propose that diffusion training may be viewed as a form of generative pre-training, equipping models with capabilities that can be unlocked through lightweight GAN fine-tuning. Supporting this view, we create a one-step generation model by fine-tuning a pre-trained model with 85% of parameters frozen, achieving strong performance with only 0.2M images and near-SOTA results with 5M images. We further present a frequency-domain analysis that may explain the one-step generative capability gained in diffusion training. Overall, our work provides a new perspective for diffusion training, highlighting its role as a powerful generative pre-training process, which can be the basis for building efficient one-step generation models.

  The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available soon, atthis https URL.

  Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.

  Continual Learning (CL) primarily aims to retain knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting and transfer knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only needs to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentionalthis http URLarises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the model to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks. From feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases simultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address this, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous memories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old tasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error Erasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in the feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of potentially biased samples. The latter ensures only erroneous knowledge is erased by shifting the decision space of representative outlier samples. Additionally, an incremental feature distribution learning strategy is designed to reduce the resource overhead during error identification in downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results show that ErrorEraser significantly mitigates the negative impact of data biases, achieving higher accuracy and lower forgetting rates across three types of CL methods.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via self-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs. While sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs, they often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work, we first propose \textit{dual-state linear attention} (\textbf{\dsla}), a novel design that maintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving historical context and one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the short-range bias typical of linear-attention architectures. To further balance efficiency and accuracy under dynamic workload conditions, we introduce \textbf{\serve}, an online \textit{adaptive distillation} framework that progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference time, guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering. \serve\ uses a chained fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly converted DSLA layer remains consistent with previously replaced layers, preserving the overall quality. Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning, long-context QA, and text summarization demonstrate that \serve\ yields \textbf{2.3x} faster inference than Llama2-7B and \textbf{3.0x} faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies show that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies, addressing the historical-token underrepresentation seen in prior linear attentions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision processes (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring neither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose learning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of actions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that captures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables critical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and reward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of progress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space where the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD, accommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the framework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values, encompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete and continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently learns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also significantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of representation quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prioritized experience replay, which improves sample efficiency by selecting relevant transitions to update parameter estimates, is a crucial component of contemporary value-based deep reinforcement learning models. Typically, transitions are prioritized based on their temporal difference error. However, this approach is prone to favoring noisy transitions, even when the value estimation closely approximates the target mean. This phenomenon resembles the noisy TV problem postulated in the exploration literature, in which exploration-guided agents get stuck by mistaking noise for novelty. To mitigate the disruptive effects of noise in value estimation, we propose using epistemic uncertainty estimation to guide the prioritization of transitions from the replay buffer. Epistemic uncertainty quantifies the uncertainty that can be reduced by learning, hence reducing transitions sampled from the buffer generated by unpredictable random processes. We first illustrate the benefits of epistemic uncertainty prioritized replay in two tabular toy models: a simple multi-arm bandit task, and a noisy gridworld. Subsequently, we evaluate our prioritization scheme on the Atari suite, outperforming quantile regression deep Q-learning benchmarks; thus forging a path for the use of uncertainty prioritized replay in reinforcement learning agents.

  Condition monitoring (CM) plays a crucial role in ensuring reliability and efficiency in the process industry. Although computerised maintenance systems effectively detect and classify faults, tasks like fault severity estimation, and maintenance decisions still largely depend on human expert analysis. The analysis and decision making automatically performed by current systems typically exhibit considerable uncertainty and high false alarm rates, leading to increased workload and reduced efficiency.This work integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning agents with CM workflows to address analyst and industry needs, namely reducing false alarms, enhancing fault severity estimation, improving decision support, and offering explainable interfaces. We propose MindRAG, a modular framework combining multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with novel vector store structures designed specifically for CM data. The framework leverages existing annotations and maintenance work orders as surrogates for labels in a supervised learning protocol, addressing the common challenge of training predictive models on unlabelled and noisy real-world datasets.The primary contributions include: (1) an approach for structuring industry CM data into a semi-structured multimodal vector store compatible with LLM-driven workflows; (2) developing multimodal RAG techniques tailored for CM data; (3) developing practical reasoning agents capable of addressing real-world CM queries; and (4) presenting an experimental framework for integrating and evaluating such agents in realistic industrial scenarios. Preliminary results, evaluated with the help of an experienced analyst, indicate that MindRAG provide meaningful decision support for more efficient management of alarms, thereby improving the interpretability of CM systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate the design of pooling methods used to summarize the outputs of transformer embedding models, primarily motivated by reinforcement learning and vision applications. This work considers problems where a subset of the input vectors contains requisite information for a downstream task (signal) while the rest are distractors (noise). By framing pooling as vector quantization with the goal of minimizing signal loss, we demonstrate that the standard methods used to aggregate transformer outputs, AvgPool, MaxPool, and ClsToken, are vulnerable to performance collapse as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inputs fluctuates. We then show that an attention-based adaptive pooling method can approximate the signal-optimal vector quantizer within derived error bounds for any SNR. Our theoretical results are first validated by supervised experiments on a synthetic dataset designed to isolate the SNR problem, then generalized to standard relational reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and vision benchmarks with noisy observations, where transformers with adaptive pooling display superior robustness across tasks.

  We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings. Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad applications in offline RL and beyond.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate probabilistic weather forecasting demands both high accuracy and efficient uncertainty quantification, challenges that overburden both ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) and recent machine-learning methods. We introduce LaDCast, the first global latent-diffusion framework for medium-range ensemble forecasting, which generates hourly ensemble forecasts entirely in a learned latent space. An autoencoder compresses high-dimensional ERA5 reanalysis fields into a compact representation, and a transformer-based diffusion model produces sequential latent updates with arbitrary hour initialization. The model incorporates Geometric Rotary Position Embedding (GeoRoPE) to account for the Earth's spherical geometry, a dual-stream attention mechanism for efficient conditioning, and sinusoidal temporal embeddings to capture seasonal patterns. LaDCast achieves deterministic and probabilistic skill close to that of the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecast IFS-ENS, without any explicit perturbations. Notably, LaDCast demonstrates superior performance in tracking rare extreme events such as cyclones, capturing their trajectories more accurately than established models. By operating in latent space, LaDCast reduces storage and compute by orders of magnitude, demonstrating a practical path toward forecasting at kilometer-scale resolution in real time. We open-source our code and models and provide the training and evaluation pipelines at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning from human feeback (RLHF) has become a key factor in aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional RL approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g., Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition). We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling, while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation, environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.

  Decision-makers often possess insufficient information to render a confident decision. In these cases, the decision-maker can often undertake actions to acquire the necessary information about the problem at hand, e.g., by consulting knowledgeable authorities or by conducting experiments. Importantly, different levers of information acquisition come with different costs, posing the challenge of selecting the actions that are both informative and cost-effective. In this work, we propose CuriosiTree, a heuristic-based, test-time policy for zero-shot information acquisition in large language models (LLMs). CuriosiTree employs a greedy tree search to estimate the expected information gain of each action and strategically chooses actions based on a balance of anticipated information gain and associated cost. Empirical validation in a clinical diagnosis simulation shows that CuriosiTree enables cost-effective integration of heterogenous sources of information, and outperforms baseline action selection strategies in selecting action sequences that enable accurate diagnosis.

  Recent innovations in multimodal action models represent a promising direction for developing general-purpose agentic systems, combining visual understanding, language comprehension, and action generation. We introduce MultiNet - a novel, fully open-source benchmark and surrounding software ecosystem designed to rigorously evaluate and adapt models across vision, language, and action domains. We establish standardized evaluation protocols for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), and provide open source software to download relevant data, models, and evaluations. Additionally, we provide a composite dataset with over 1.3 trillion tokens of image captioning, visual question answering, commonsense reasoning, robotic control, digital game-play, simulated locomotion/manipulation, and many more tasks. The MultiNet benchmark, framework, toolkit, and evaluation harness have been used in downstream research on the limitations of VLA generalization.

  _Samuel Holt, Max Ruiz Luyten, Thomas Pouplin, Mihaela van der Schaar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks, achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electroencephalography (EEG) provides real-time insights into brain activity and is widely used in neuroscience. However, variations in channel configurations, sequence lengths, and task objectives limit the transferability of traditional task-specific models. Although recent EEG foundation models (EFMs) aim to learn generalizable representations, they struggle with limited heterogeneous representation capacity and inefficiency in capturing multi-scale brain dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose CodeBrain, an efficient EFM structurally aligned with brain organization, trained in two stages. (1) We introduce a TFDual-Tokenizer that independently tokenizes heterogeneous temporal and frequency components, enabling a quadratic expansion of the discrete representation space. This also offers a degree of interpretability through cross-domain token analysis. (2) We propose the EEGSSM, which combines a structured global convolution architecture and a sliding window attention mechanism to jointly model sparse long-range and local dependencies. Unlike fully connected Transformer models, EEGSSM better reflects the brain's small-world topology and efficiently captures EEG's inherent multi-scale structure. EEGSSM is trained with a masked self-supervised learning objective to predict token indices obtained in TFDual-Tokenizer. Comprehensive experiments on 10 public EEG datasets demonstrate the generalizability of CodeBrain with linear probing. By offering biologically informed and interpretable EEG modeling, CodeBrain lays the foundation for future neuroscience research. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in the future version.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical, structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over 59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

  _Jung Hyun Lee, Seungjae Shin, Vinnam Kim, Jaeseong You, An Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices, there is growing interest in extremely low-bit quantization, such as 2-bit. Although prior works have shown that 2-bit large models are pareto-optimal over their 4-bit smaller counterparts in both accuracy and latency, these advancements have been limited to pre-trained LLMs and have not yet been extended to instruction-tuned models. To bridge this gap, we propose Unified Progressive Quantization (UPQ)$-$a novel progressive quantization framework (FP16$\rightarrow$INT4$\rightarrow$INT2) that unifies block-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) with distillation-based quantization-aware training (Distill-QAT) for INT2 instruction-tuned LLM quantization. UPQ first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned models to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to significantly reduce the quantization error introduced by subsequent INT2 quantization. Next, UPQ applies Distill-QAT to enable INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs to generate responses consistent with their original FP16 counterparts by minimizing the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the two. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that UPQ can quantize open-source instruction-tuned LLMs to INT2 without relying on proprietary post-training data, while achieving state-of-the-art performances on MMLU and IFEval$-$two of the most representative benchmarks for evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.

  _Joshua Barron, Devin White_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization (via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size) succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the design and deployment of small language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-task learning (MTL) concurrently trains a model on diverse task datasets to exploit common features, thereby improving overall performance across the tasks. Recent studies have dedicated efforts to merging multiple independent model parameters into a unified model for MTL, thus circumventing the need for training data and expanding the scope of applicable scenarios of MTL. However, current approaches to model merging predominantly concentrate on enhancing performance within in-domain (ID) datasets, often overlooking their efficacy on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. In this work, we proposed LwPTV (Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the redundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve mask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task vectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding layer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly integrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their performance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the application of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD performance while preserving the ability on ID tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in general-purpose code generation. However, generating the code which is deeply hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs, with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance, which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific, architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.

  _Arthur Oghlukyan, Nuria Gomez Blas_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of an enhanced asynchronous AdaBoost framework for federated learning (FL), focusing on its application across five distinct domains: computer vision on edge devices, blockchain-based model transparency, on-device mobile personalization, IoT anomaly detection, and federated healthcare diagnostics. The proposed algorithm incorporates adaptive communication scheduling and delayed weight compensation to reduce synchronization frequency and communication overhead while preserving or improving model accuracy. We examine how these innovations improve communication efficiency, scalability, convergence, and robustness in each domain. Comparative metrics including training time, communication overhead, convergence iterations, and classification accuracy are evaluated using data and estimates derived from Oghlukyan's enhanced AdaBoost framework. Empirical results show, for example, training time reductions on the order of 20-35% and communication overhead reductions of 30-40% compared to baseline AdaBoost, with convergence achieved in significantly fewer boosting rounds. Tables and charts summarize these improvements by domain. Mathematical formulations of the adaptive scheduling rule and error-driven synchronization thresholds are provided. Overall, the enhanced AdaBoost exhibits markedly improved efficiency and robustness across diverse FL scenarios, suggesting broad applicability of the approach.

  _Xinyuan Wang, Haoyue Bai, Nanxu Gong, Wangyang Ying, Sixun Dong, Xiquan Cui, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Feature transformation enhances data representation by deriving new features from the original data. Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces challenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation (error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and LLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax, while ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap, we propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's gradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples generation, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of the teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search, intending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space; (3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the teacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the student LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation. The experiments on various datasets show that the teaming policy can achieve 5\% improvement in downstream performance while reducing nearly half of the error cases. The results also demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the teaming policy. Additionally, we also have exciting findings on LLMs' capacity to understand the original data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results is crucial to enhancing user experience and engagement. Whole Page Optimization (WPO) plays a pivotal role in this process, as it directly influences how information is surfaced to users. While Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant content, fine-tuning these models for complex tasks like WPO presents challenges. Specifically, the need for extensive human-annotated data to mitigate issues such as hallucinations and model instability can be prohibitively expensive, especially in large-scale systems that interact with millions of items daily. In this work, we address the challenge of fine-tuning LLMs for WPO by using user feedback as the supervision. Unlike manually labeled datasets, user feedback is inherently noisy and less precise. To overcome this, we propose a reward-based fine-tuning approach, PageLLM, which employs a mixed-grained reward mechanism that combines page-level and item-level rewards. The page-level reward evaluates the overall quality and coherence, while the item-level reward focuses on the accuracy and relevance of key recommendations. This dual-reward structure ensures that both the holistic presentation and the critical individual components are optimized. We validate PageLLM on both public and industrial datasets. PageLLM outperforms baselines and achieves a 0.44\% GMV increase in an online A/B test with over 10 million users, demonstrating its real-world impact.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models are an emerging research direction in tabular deep learning. Notably, TabPFNv2 recently claimed superior performance over traditional GBDT-based methods on small-scale datasets using an in-context learning paradigm, which does not adapt model parameters to target datasets. However, the optimal finetuning approach for adapting tabular foundational models, and how this adaptation reshapes their internal mechanisms, remains underexplored. While prior works studied finetuning for earlier foundational models, inconsistent findings and TabPFNv2's unique architecture necessitate fresh investigation. To address these questions, we first systematically evaluate various finetuning strategies on diverse datasets. Our findings establish full finetuning as the most practical solution for TabPFNv2 in terms of time-efficiency and effectiveness. We then investigate how finetuning alters TabPFNv2's inner mechanisms, drawing an analogy to retrieval-augmented models. We reveal that the success of finetuning stems from the fact that after gradient-based adaptation, the dot products of the query-representations of test objects and the key-representations of in-context training objects more accurately reflect their target similarity. This improved similarity allows finetuned TabPFNv2 to better approximate target dependency by appropriately weighting relevant in-context samples, improving the retrieval-based prediction logic. From the practical perspective, we managed to finetune TabPFNv2 on datasets with up to 50K objects, observing performance improvements on almost all tasks. More precisely, on academic datasets with I.I.D. splits, finetuning allows TabPFNv2 to achieve state-of-the-art results, while on datasets with gradual temporal shifts and rich feature sets, TabPFNv2 is less stable and prior methods remain better.

  _Phuc Minh Nguyen, Ngoc-Hieu Nguyen, Duy H. M. Nguyen, Anji Liu, An Mai, Binh T. Nguyen, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as alternatives to the standard Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are more susceptible to over-optimization, in which the model drifts away from the reference policy, leading to degraded performance as training progresses. This paper proposes a novel importance-sampling approach to mitigate the over-optimization problem of offline DAAs. This approach, called (IS-DAAs), multiplies the DAA objective with an importance ratio that accounts for the reference policy distribution. IS-DAAs additionally avoid the high variance issue associated with importance sampling by clipping the importance ratio to a maximum value. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that IS-DAAs can effectively mitigate over-optimization, especially under low regularization strength, and achieve better performance than other methods designed to address this problem. Our implementations are provided publicly at this link.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advances in deep learning for automatic sleep staging, clinical adoption remains limited due to challenges in fair model evaluation, generalization across diverse datasets, model bias, and variability in human annotations. We present SLEEPYLAND, an open-source sleep staging evaluation framework designed to address these barriers. It includes more than 220'000 hours in-domain (ID) sleep recordings, and more than 84'000 hours out-of-domain (OOD) sleep recordings, spanning a broad range of ages, sleep-wake disorders, and hardware setups. We release pre-trained models based on high-performing SoA architectures and evaluate them under standardized conditions across single- and multi-channel EEG/EOG configurations. We introduce SOMNUS, an ensemble combining models across architectures and channel setups via soft voting. SOMNUS achieves robust performance across twenty-four different datasets, with macro-F1 scores between 68.7% and 87.2%, outperforming individual models in 94.9% of cases. Notably, SOMNUS surpasses previous SoA methods, even including cases where compared models were trained ID while SOMNUS treated the same data as OOD. Using a subset of the BSWR (N=6'633), we quantify model biases linked to age, gender, AHI, and PLMI, showing that while ensemble improves robustness, no model architecture consistently minimizes bias in performance and clinical markers estimation. In evaluations on OOD multi-annotated datasets (DOD-H, DOD-O), SOMNUS exceeds the best human scorer, i.e., MF1 85.2% vs 80.8% on DOD-H, and 80.2% vs 75.9% on DOD-O, better reproducing the scorer consensus than any individual expert (k = 0.89/0.85 and ACS = 0.95/0.94 for healthy/OSA cohorts). Finally, we introduce ensemble disagreement metrics - entropy and inter-model divergence based - predicting regions of scorer disagreement with ROC AUCs up to 0.828, offering a data-driven proxy for human uncertainty.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Communication system formulation is critical for advancing 6G and future wireless technologies, yet it remains a complex, expertise-intensive task. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, existing general-purpose models often lack the specialized domain knowledge, nuanced reasoning capabilities, and access to high-quality, domain-specific training data required for adapting a general LLM into an LLM specially for communication system formulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepForm, the first reasoning LLM specially for automated communication system formulation. We propose the world-first large-scale, open-source dataset meticulously curated for this domain called Communication System Formulation Reasoning Corpus (CSFRC). Our framework employs a two-stage training strategy: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data to distill domain knowledge; second, a novel rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, C-ReMax based on ReMax, to cultivate advanced modeling capabilities and elicit sophisticated reasoning patterns like self-correction and verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming larger proprietary LLMs on diverse senerios. We will release related resources to foster further research in this area after the paper is accepted.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to safety risks during fine-tuning, where small amounts of malicious or harmless data can compromise safeguards. In this paper, building on the concept of alignment direction -- defined by the weight difference between aligned and unaligned models -- we observe that perturbations along this direction preserve model safety. In contrast, perturbations along directions orthogonal to this alignment are strongly linked to harmful direction perturbations, rapidly degrading safety and framing the parameter space as a narrow safety basin. Based on this insight, we propose a methodology for safety fine-tuning called AsFT (Anchoring Safety in Fine-Tuning), which integrates a regularization term into the training objective. This term uses the alignment direction as an anchor to suppress updates in harmful directions, ensuring that fine-tuning is constrained within the narrow safety basin. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that AsFT outperforms Safe LoRA, reducing harmful behavior by 7.60 percent, improving model performance by 3.44 percent, and maintaining robust performance across various experimental settings.

  _Katherine Tieu, Dongqi Fu, Zihao Li, Ross Maciejewski, Jingrui He_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, L-STEP obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Designing neural networks typically relies on manual trial and error or a neural architecture search (NAS) followed by weight training. The former is time-consuming and labor-intensive, while the latter often discretizes architecture search and weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally different approach that simultaneously optimizes both the architecture and the weights of a neural network. Our framework first trains a universal multi-scale autoencoder that embeds both architectural and parametric information into a continuous latent space, where functionally similar neural networks are mapped closer together. Given a dataset, we then randomly initialize a point in the embedding space and update it via gradient descent to obtain the optimal neural network, jointly optimizing its structure and weights. The optimization process incorporates sparsity and compactness penalties to promote efficient models. Experiments on synthetic regression tasks demonstrate that our method effectively discovers sparse and compact neural networks with strong performance.

  Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

  A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.

  Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are foundational tools for modeling sequential data with latent Markovian structure, yet fitting them to real-world data remains computationally challenging. In this work, we show that pre-trained large language models (LLMs) can effectively model data generated by HMMs via in-context learning (ICL)$\unicode{x2013}$their ability to infer patterns from examples within a prompt. On a diverse set of synthetic HMMs, LLMs achieve predictive accuracy approaching the theoretical optimum. We uncover novel scaling trends influenced by HMM properties, and offer theoretical conjectures for these empirical observations. We also provide practical guidelines for scientists on using ICL as a diagnostic tool for complex data. On real-world animal decision-making tasks, ICL achieves competitive performance with models designed by human experts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that ICL can learn and predict HMM-generated sequences$\unicode{x2013}$an advance that deepens our understanding of in-context learning in LLMs and establishes its potential as a powerful tool for uncovering hidden structure in complex scientific data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment, it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes, i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements. Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation performance of Adam within 44% of the gradient steps and 62% of the wallclock time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge, with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, PrunE retains the invariant subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization. Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges: 1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2) $\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the internal representations and decision mechanisms of deep neural networks remains a critical open challenge. While existing interpretability methods often identify influential input regions, they may not elucidate how a model distinguishes between classes or what specific changes would transition an input from one category to another. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that visualizes the implicit path between classes by treating the network gradient as a form of infinitesimal motion. Drawing inspiration from phase-based motion magnification, we first decompose images using invertible transforms-specifically the Complex Steerable Pyramid-then compute class-conditional gradients in the transformed space. Rather than iteratively integrating the gradient to trace a full path, we amplify the one-step gradient to the input and perform a linear extrapolation to expose how the model moves from source to target class. By operating in the steerable pyramid domain, these amplified gradients produce semantically meaningful, spatially coherent morphs that highlight the classifier's most sensitive directions, giving insight into the geometry of its decision boundaries. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our phase-focused extrapolation yields perceptually aligned, semantically meaningful transformations, offering a novel, interpretable lens into neural classifiers' internal representations.

  In recent years, developing compact and efficient large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a thriving area of research. Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which relies on singular ground truth labels, often fails to capture token-level dependencies and linguistic diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a logits-based fine-tuning framework that integrates the strengths of supervised learning and knowledge distillation. Our approach constructs enriched training targets by combining teacher logits with ground truth labels, preserving both correctness and linguistic diversity. This ensures more reliable and effective training. We constructed a large-scale 1.2M logits dataset and trained a series of science-focused models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements, with accuracy gains of 18% on Mawps and 22.7% on TabMWP. Across nine widely used mathematical benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms prior SFT models, achieving an average improvement of 7.28%. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning. Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation. Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws, allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable, uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Explicit noise-level conditioning is widely regarded as essential for the effective operation of Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs). In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether denoisers can implicitly infer noise levels directly from corrupted graph structures, potentially eliminating the need for explicit noise conditioning. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework centered on Bernoulli edge-flip corruptions and extend it to encompass more complex scenarios involving coupled structure-attribute noise. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets, using models such as GDSS and DiGress, provide strong support for our theoretical findings. Notably, unconditional GDMs achieve performance comparable or superior to their conditioned counterparts, while also offering reductions in parameters (4-6%) and computation time (8-10%). Our results suggest that the high-dimensional nature of graph data itself often encodes sufficient information for the denoising process, opening avenues for simpler, more efficient GDM architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Learning requires a model to learn multiple tasks in sequence while maintaining both stability:preserving knowledge from previously learned tasks, and plasticity:effectively learning new tasks. Gradient projection has emerged as an effective and popular paradigm in CL, where it partitions the gradient space of previously learned tasks into two orthogonal subspaces: a primary subspace and a minor subspace. New tasks are learned effectively within the minor subspace, thereby reducing interference with previously acquired knowledge. However, existing Gradient Projection methods struggle to achieve an optimal balance between plasticity and stability, as it is hard to appropriately partition the gradient space. In this work, we consider a continual learning paradigm based on Low-Rank Adaptation, which has gained considerable attention due to its efficiency and wide applicability, and propose a novel approach for continual learning, called SplitLoRA. We first provide a theoretical analysis of how subspace partitioning affects model stability and plasticity. Informed by this analysis, we then introduce an effective method that derives the optimal partition of the gradient space for previously learned tasks. This approach effectively balances stability and plasticity in continual learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization. The project page is atthis https URL

  What is the shortest path between two data points lying in a high-dimensional space? While the answer is trivial in Euclidean geometry, it becomes significantly more complex when the data lies on a curved manifold -- requiring a Riemannian metric to describe the space's local curvature. Estimating such a metric, however, remains a major challenge in high dimensions.In this work, we propose a method for deriving Riemannian metrics directly from pretrained Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- a class of generative models that assign low energy to high-density regions. These metrics define spatially varying distances, enabling the computation of geodesics -- shortest paths that follow the data manifold's intrinsic geometry. We introduce two novel metrics derived from EBMs and show that they produce geodesics that remain closer to the data manifold and exhibit lower curvature distortion, as measured by alignment with ground-truth trajectories. We evaluate our approach on increasingly complex datasets: synthetic datasets with known data density, rotated character images with interpretable geometry, and high-resolution natural images embedded in a pretrained VAE latent space.Our results show that EBM-derived metrics consistently outperform established baselines, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our work is the first to derive Riemannian metrics from EBMs, enabling data-aware geodesics and unlocking scalable, geometry-driven learning for generative modeling and simulation.

  We consider the problem of estimating and optimizing utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR) of a loss, say $(Y - \hat Y)^2$, in the context of a regression problem. Empirical risk minimization with a UBSR objective is challenging since UBSR is a non-linear function of the underlying distribution. We first derive a concentration bound for UBSR estimation using independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. We then frame the UBSR optimization problem as minimization of a pseudo-linear function in the space of achievable distributions $\mathcal D$ of the loss $(Y- \hat Y)^2$. We construct a gradient oracle for the UBSR objective and a linear minimization oracle (LMO) for the set $\mathcal D$. Using these oracles, we devise a bisection-type algorithm, and establish convergence to the UBSR-optimal solution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.

  The use of large language models (LLMs) as feature enhancers to optimize node representations, which are then used as inputs for graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown significant potential in graph representation learning. However, the fundamental properties of this approach remain underexplored. To address this issue, we propose conducting a more in-depth analysis of this issue based on the interchange intervention method. First, we construct a synthetic graph dataset with controllable causal relationships, enabling precise manipulation of semantic relationships and causal modeling to provide data for analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their underlying logic and internal mechanisms. Building on the analytical results, we design a plug-and-play optimization module to improve the information transfer between LLM enhancers and GNNs. Experiments across multiple datasets and models validate the proposed module.

  Visualizations of the loss landscape in neural networks suggest that minima are isolated points. However, both theoretical and empirical studies indicate that it is possible to connect two different minima with a path consisting of intermediate points that also have low loss. In this study, we propose a new algorithm which investigates low-loss paths in the full parameter space, not only between two minima. Our experiments on LeNet5, ResNet18, and Compact Convolutional Transformer architectures consistently demonstrate the existence of such continuous paths in the parameter space. These results suggest that the low-loss region is a fully connected and continuous space in the parameter space. Our findings provide theoretical insight into neural network over-parameterization, highlighting that parameters collectively define a high-dimensional low-loss space, implying parameter redundancy exists only within individual models and not throughout the entire low-loss space. Additionally, our work also provides new visualization methods and opportunities to improve model generalization by exploring the low-loss space that is closer to the origin.

  _Aviv Bick, Eric Xing, Albert Gu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-space models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives to Transformers for long sequences, but their fixed-size recurrent state limits capability on algorithmic tasks, such as retrieving past context. In this work, we examine how in-context retrieval operates in Transformer- and SSM-based language models and find that both rely on a similar Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism: a Gather Head extracts relevant information pieces from context, which an Aggregate Head integrates into a single representation. In both architectures, G&A concentrates in a few heads, forming critical bottlenecks even for simple retrieval. For example, we show that disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head in a pruned Llama-3.1-8B impairs retrieving the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing its accuracy from 66% to 25% (random guessing). Moreover, this retrieval bottleneck can obscure limited knowledge demands of tasks as the pruned model succeeds on MMLU with functioning G&A heads yet fails on other knowledge benchmarks. The bottleneck similarly extends to tasks where SSMs typically underperform, such as GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue comprehension. We show that SSMs' retrieval challenges manifest in these heads, creating smoother attention patterns instead of the sharp token transitions effective G&A requires. Thus, the Transformer-SSM retrieval gap exists in just a few heads, rather than the entire language model. This suggests a unified explanation for Transformer vs. SSM performance gap while showing how to merge their strengths. We find that pretrained hybrid models, where SSMs are combined with a few attention layers, delegate the role of Aggregate Heads to attention. Similarly, replacing a single G&A head in a pretrained SSM with an attention variant boosts retrieval and benchmark scores.

  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an important technical and storytelling tool to deploy the latest machine learning systems. In this book, we hope to give a gentle introduction to the core methods for people with some level of quantitative background. The book starts with the origins of RLHF -- both in recent literature and in a convergence of disparate fields of science in economics, philosophy, and optimal control. We then set the stage with definitions, problem formulation, data collection, and other common math used in the literature. The core of the book details every optimization stage in using RLHF, from starting with instruction tuning to training a reward model and finally all of rejection sampling, reinforcement learning, and direct alignment algorithms. The book concludes with advanced topics -- understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation -- and open questions for the field.

  Discriminator Guidance has become a popular method for efficiently refining pre-trained Score-Matching Diffusion models. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that the standard implementation of this technique does not necessarily lead to a distribution closer to the real data distribution. Specifically, we show that training the discriminator using Cross-Entropy loss, as commonly done, can in fact increase the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and target distributions, particularly when the discriminator overfits. To address this, we propose a theoretically sound training objective for discriminator guidance that properly minimizes the KL divergence. We analyze its properties and demonstrate empirically across multiple datasets that our proposed method consistently improves over the conventional method by producing samples of higher quality.

  3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality. On GEOM-Drugs, it reduces FCD by 72.6\% over the previous best result, while achieving over 70\% relative average improvements in geometric fidelity.

  Model merging seeks to integrate task-specific expert models into a unified architecture while preserving multi-task generalization capabilities, yet parameter interference between constituent models frequently induces performance degradation. Although prior work has explored many merging strategies, resolving interference without additional data for retraining or test-time computation remains challenging. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that the task vectors of the linear layer constitute an approximate linear subspace for its corresponding input. Therefore, we can minimize interference under the guidance of task vectors. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{WUDI-Merging} (\textbf{W}hoever started the interference sho\textbf{U}ld en\textbf{D} \textbf{I}t), a simple yet effective model merging method that eliminates interference without any additional data or rescaling coefficients. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across vision and language benchmarks demonstrate our method's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-free model merging scenarios (average 10.9\% improvement versus baseline methods) while even outperforming mainstream test-time adaptation approaches by 3.3\%, and only very few computing resources are required. The code will be publicly available soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Mechanistic PDE Networks -- a model for discovery of governing partial differential equations from data. Mechanistic PDE Networks represent spatiotemporal data as space-time dependent linear partial differential equations in neural network hidden representations. The represented PDEs are then solved and decoded for specific tasks. The learned PDE representations naturally express the spatiotemporal dynamics in data in neural network hidden space, enabling increased power for dynamical modeling. Solving the PDE representations in a compute and memory-efficient way, however, is a significant challenge. We develop a native, GPU-capable, parallel, sparse, and differentiable multigrid solver specialized for linear partial differential equations that acts as a module in Mechanistic PDE Networks. Leveraging the PDE solver, we propose a discovery architecture that can discover nonlinear PDEs in complex settings while also being robust to noise. We validate PDE discovery on a number of PDEs, including reaction-diffusion and Navier-Stokes equations.

  Tabular datasets are inherently heterogeneous, presenting significant challenges for developing pre-trained foundation models. The recently introduced transformer-based Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network v2 (TabPFN v2) achieves unprecedented in-context learning performance across diverse downstream datasets, marking a pivotal advancement in tabular foundation models. In this paper, we take a closer look at TabPFN v2 to examine how it effectively handles heterogeneity and achieves high predictive accuracy, and to explore how its limitations in high-dimensional, many-category, and large-scale tasks can be mitigated. We find that TabPFN v2 can infer attribute relationships even when provided with randomized attribute token inputs, eliminating the need to explicitly learn dataset-specific attribute embeddings to address heterogeneity. We further show that TabPFN v2 can be transformed into a feature extractor, revealing its ability to construct a highly separable feature space for accurate predictions. Lastly, we demonstrate that TabPFN v2's limitations can be addressed through a test-time divide-and-conquer strategy, enabling scalable inference without requiring re-training. By uncovering the mechanisms behind TabPFN v2's success and introducing strategies to extend its applicability, this study offers key insights into the design of future tabular foundation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly explored for their energy efficiency and robustness in real-world applications, yet their privacy risks remain largely unexamined. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility of SNNs to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) -- a major privacy threat where an adversary attempts to determine whether a given sample was part of the training dataset. While prior work suggests that SNNs may offer inherent robustness due to their discrete, event-driven nature, we find that its resilience diminishes as latency (T) increases. Furthermore, we introduce an input dropout strategy under black box setting, that significantly enhances membership inference in SNNs. Our findings challenge the assumption that SNNs are inherently more secure, and even though they are expected to be better, our results reveal that SNNs exhibit privacy vulnerabilities that are equally comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training-free guidance enables controlled generation in diffusion and flow models, but most methods rely on gradients and assume differentiable objectives. This work focuses on training-free guidance addressing challenges from non-differentiable objectives and discrete data distributions. We propose TreeG: Tree Search-Based Path Steering Guidance, applicable to both continuous and discrete settings in diffusion and flow models. TreeG offers a unified framework for training-free guidance by proposing, evaluating, and selecting candidates at each step, enhanced with tree search over active paths and parallel exploration. We comprehensively investigate the design space of TreeG over the candidate proposal module and the evaluation function, instantiating TreeG into three novel algorithms. Our experiments show that TreeG consistently outperforms top guidance baselines in symbolic music generation, small molecule design, and enhancer DNA design with improvements of 29.01%, 16.6%, and 18.43%. Additionally, we identify an inference-time scaling law showing TreeG's scalability in inference-time computation.

  Self-supervised learning (SSL) allows training data representations without a supervised signal and has become an important paradigm in machine learning. Most SSL methods employ the cosine similarity between embedding vectors and hence effectively embed data on a hypersphere. While this seemingly implies that embedding norms cannot play any role in SSL, a few recent works have suggested that embedding norms have properties related to network convergence and confidence. In this paper, we resolve this apparent contradiction and systematically establish the embedding norm's role in SSL training. Using theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments, we show that embedding norms (i) govern SSL convergence rates and (ii) encode network confidence, with smaller norms corresponding to unexpected samples. Additionally, we show that manipulating embedding norms can have large effects on convergence speed. Our findings demonstrate that SSL embedding norms are integral to understanding and optimizing network behavior.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The scaling of model and data sizes has reshaped the AI landscape, establishing finetuning pretrained models as the standard paradigm for solving downstream tasks. However, dominant finetuning methods typically rely on weight adaptation, often lack interpretability, and depend on heuristically chosen hyperparameters. In this paper, we take a different perspective and shift the focus from weights to activation functions, viewing them through the lens of spline operators. We propose Curvature Tuning (CT), an interpretable and principled steering method that modulates a model's decision boundary by injecting a single hyperparameter into its activation functions. We show that CT provably adjusts model decision boundary curvature and, more fundamentally, projects a model onto a space of smooth functions-thereby complementing current finetuning methods, whose effect lies primarily in feature adaptation. Making this hyperparameter trainable gives rise to a novel and highly parameter-efficient finetuning method. Empirically, CT improves both generalization and robustness. For example, it boosts downstream accuracy of ResNet-50/152 by 7.14%/8.46% over linear probing and 4.64%/1.70% over LoRA across 12 datasets, and improves robust accuracy on the $\ell_\infty$ benchmark from RobustBench by 1032.64%/1494.46%.

  _Roussel Desmond Nzoyem, Grant Stevens, Amarpal Sahota, David A.W. Barton, Tom Deakin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As foundational models reshape scientific discovery, a bottleneck persists in dynamical system reconstruction (DSR): the ability to learn across system hierarchies. Many meta-learning approaches have been applied successfully to single systems, but falter when confronted with sparse, loosely related datasets requiring multiple hierarchies to be learned. Mixture of Experts (MoE) offers a natural paradigm to address these challenges. Despite their potential, we demonstrate that naive MoEs are inadequate for the nuanced demands of hierarchical DSR, largely due to their gradient descent-based gating update mechanism which leads to slow updates and conflicted routing during training. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MixER: Mixture of Expert Reconstructors, a novel sparse top-1 MoE layer employing a custom gating update algorithm based on $K$-means and least squares. Extensive experiments validate MixER's capabilities, demonstrating efficient training and scalability to systems of up to ten parametric ordinary differential equations. However, our layer underperforms state-of-the-art meta-learners in high-data regimes, particularly when each expert is constrained to process only a fraction of a dataset composed of highly related data points. Further analysis with synthetic and neuroscientific time series suggests that the quality of the contextual representations generated by MixER is closely linked to the presence of hierarchical structure in the data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One approach to reducing the massive costs of large language models (LLMs) is the use of quantized or sparse representations for training or deployment. While post-training compression methods are very popular, the question of obtaining even more accurate compressed models by directly training over such representations, i.e., Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), is still open: for example, a recent study (arXiv:2411.04330) put the "optimal" bit-width at which models can be trained using QAT, while staying accuracy-competitive with standard FP16/BF16 precision, at 8-bits weights and activations. We advance this state-of-the-art via a new method called QuEST, for which we demonstrate optimality at 4-bits and stable convergence as low as 1-bit weights and activations. QuEST achieves this by improving two key aspects of QAT methods: (1) accurate and fast quantization of the (continuous) distributions of weights and activations via Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal fitting; (2) a new trust gradient estimator based on the idea of explicitly minimizing the error between the noisy gradient computed over quantized states and the "true" (but unknown) full-precision gradient. Experiments on Llama-type architectures show that QuEST induces stable scaling laws across the entire range of hardware-supported precisions, and can be extended to sparse representations. We provide GPU kernel support showing that models produced by QuEST can be executed efficiently. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model merging integrates the weights of multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task model. Despite recent interest in the problem, a significant performance gap between the combined and single-task models remains. In this paper, we investigate the key characteristics of task matrices -- weight update matrices applied to a pre-trained model -- that enable effective merging. We show that alignment between singular components of task-specific and merged matrices strongly correlates with performance improvement over the pre-trained model. Based on this, we propose an isotropic merging framework that flattens the singular value spectrum of task matrices, enhances alignment, and reduces the performance gap. Additionally, we incorporate both common and task-specific subspaces to further improve alignment and performance. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on vision and language tasks across various sets of tasks and model scales. This work advances the understanding of model merging dynamics, offering an effective methodology to merge models without requiring additional training. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider learning underlying laws of dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODE). A key challenge is how to discover intrinsic dynamics across multiple environments while circumventing environment-specific mechanisms. Unlike prior work, we tackle more complex environments where changes extend beyond function coefficients to entirely different function forms. For example, we demonstrate the discovery of ideal pendulum's natural motion $\alpha^2 \sin{\theta_t}$ by observing pendulum dynamics in different environments, such as the damped environment $\alpha^2 \sin(\theta_t) - \rho \omega_t$ and powered environment $\alpha^2 \sin(\theta_t) + \rho \frac{\omega_t}{\left|\omega_t\right|}$. Here, we formulate this problem as an \emph{invariant function learning} task and propose a new method, known as \textbf{D}isentanglement of \textbf{I}nvariant \textbf{F}unctions (DIF), that is grounded in causal analysis. We propose a causal graph and design an encoder-decoder hypernetwork that explicitly disentangles invariant functions from environment-specific dynamics. The discovery of invariant functions is guaranteed by our information-based principle that enforces the independence between extracted invariant functions and environments. Quantitative comparisons with meta-learning and invariant learning baselines on three ODE systems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Furthermore, symbolic regression explanation results highlight the ability of our framework to uncover intrinsic laws. Our code has been released as part of the AIRS library (\href{this https URL}{this https URL}).

  _Yalin Liao, Austin J. Brockmeier_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised anomaly detection is a challenging task. Autoencoders (AEs) or generative models are often employed to model the data distribution of normal inputs and subsequently identify anomalous, out-of-distribution inputs by high reconstruction error or low likelihood, respectively. However, AEs may generalize and achieve small reconstruction errors on abnormal inputs. We propose a decoupled training approach for anomaly detection that both an AE and a likelihood model trained with noise contrastive estimation (NCE). After training the AE, NCE estimates a probability density function, to serve as the anomaly score, on the joint space of the AE's latent representation combined with features of the reconstruction quality. To further reduce the false negative rate in NCE we systematically varying the reconstruction features to augment the training and optimize the contrastive Gaussian noise distribution. Experimental assessments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach matches the performance of prevalent state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms.

  While recent AI-for-math has made strides in pure mathematics, areas of applied mathematics, particularly PDEs, remain underexplored despite their significant real-world applications. We present PDE-Controller, a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to control systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach enables LLMs to transform informal natural language instructions into formal specifications, and then execute reasoning and planning steps to improve the utility of PDE control. We build a holistic solution comprising datasets (both human-written cases and 2 million synthetic samples), math-reasoning models, and novel evaluation metrics, all of which require significant effort. Our PDE-Controller significantly outperforms prompting the latest open source and GPT models in reasoning, autoformalization, and program synthesis, achieving up to a 62% improvement in utility gain for PDE control. By bridging the gap between language generation and PDE systems, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs in addressing complex scientific and engineering challenges.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.

  Knowledge Editing (KE) algorithms alter models' weights to perform targeted updates to incorrect, outdated, or otherwise unwanted factual associations. However, recent work has shown that applying KE can adversely affect models' broader factual recall accuracy and diminish their reasoning abilities. Although these studies give insights into the potential harms of KE algorithms, e.g., performance evaluations on benchmarks, little is understood about why such destructive failures occur. Motivated by this, we define a novel synthetic task in which a Transformer is trained from scratch to internalize a "structured" knowledge graph. The structure enforces relationships between entities of the graph, such that editing a factual association has "trickling effects" on other entities (e.g., altering X's parent is Y to Z affects who X's siblings' parent is). Through evaluations of edited models on this task, we show that KE inadvertently affects representations of entities beyond the targeted one, distorting relevant structures that allow a model to infer unseen knowledge about an entity. We call this phenomenon representation shattering and demonstrate that it degrades models' factual recall and reasoning performance. We further corroborate our findings in naturalistic settings with pre-trained Llama and Mamba models as well. Overall, our work yields a precise mechanistic hypothesis to explain why KE has adverse effects on model abilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and video generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that maximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adam outperforms SGD when training language models. Yet this advantage is not well-understood theoretically -- previous convergence analysis for Adam and SGD mainly focuses on the number of steps $T$ and is already minimax-optimal in non-convex cases, which are both $\widetilde{O}(T^{-1/4})$. In this work, we argue that the exploitation of nice $\ell_\infty$-geometry is the key advantage of Adam over SGD. More specifically, we give a new convergence analysis for Adam under novel assumptions that loss is smooth under $\ell_\infty$-geometry rather than the more common $\ell_2$-geometry, which yields a much better empirical smoothness constant for GPT-2 and ResNet models. Our experiments confirm that Adam performs much worse when the favorable $\ell_\infty$-geometry is changed while SGD provably remains unaffected. We also extend the convergence analysis to blockwise Adam under novel blockwise smoothness assumptions.

  Self-supervised learning has garnered increasing attention in time series analysis for benefiting various downstream tasks and reducing reliance on labeled data. Despite its effectiveness, existing methods often struggle to comprehensively capture both long-term dynamic evolution and subtle local patterns in a unified manner. In this work, we propose \textbf{TimeDART}, a novel self-supervised time series pre-training framework that unifies two powerful generative paradigms to learn more transferable representations. Specifically, we first employ a causal Transformer encoder, accompanied by a patch-based embedding strategy, to model the evolving trends from left to right. Building on this global modeling, we further introduce a denoising diffusion process to capture fine-grained local patterns through forward diffusion and reverse denoising. Finally, we optimize the model in an autoregressive manner. As a result, TimeDART effectively accounts for both global and local sequence features in a coherent way. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets for time series forecasting and classification. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeDART consistently outperforms previous compared methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting the emergence of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is crucial for early intervention and personalized healthcare, as MCC significantly impacts patient outcomes and healthcare costs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective methods for modeling complex graph data, such as those found in MCC. However, a significant challenge with GNNs is their reliance on an existing graph structure, which is not readily available for MCC. To address this challenge, we propose a novel generative framework for GNNs that constructs a representative underlying graph structure by utilizing the distribution of the data to enhance predictive analytics for MCC. Our framework employs a graph variational autoencoder (GVAE) to capture the complex relationships in patient data. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of individual health trajectories and facilitates the creation of diverse patient stochastic similarity graphs while preserving the original feature set. These variations of patient stochastic similarity graphs, generated from the GVAE decoder, are then processed by a GNN using a novel Laplacian regularization technique to refine the graph structure over time and improves the prediction accuracy of MCC. A contextual Bandit is designed to evaluate the stochastically generated graphs and identify the best-performing graph for the GNN model iteratively until model convergence. We validate the performance of the proposed contextual Bandit algorithm against $\varepsilon$-Greedy and multi-armed Bandit algorithms on a large cohort (n = 1,592) of patients with MCC. These advancements highlight the potential of the proposed approach to transform predictive healthcare analytics, enabling a more personalized and proactive approach to MCC management.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning algorithms aim to efficiently remove data from a model without retraining it from scratch, in order to remove corrupted or outdated data or respect a user's ``right to be forgotten." Certified machine unlearning is a strong theoretical guarantee based on differential privacy that quantifies the extent to which an algorithm erases data from the model weights. In contrast to existing works in certified unlearning for convex or strongly convex loss functions, or nonconvex objectives with limiting assumptions, we propose the first, first-order, black-box (i.e., can be applied to models pretrained with vanilla gradient descent) algorithm for unlearning on general nonconvex loss functions, which unlearns by ``rewinding" to an earlier step during the learning process before performing gradient descent on the loss function of the retained data points. We prove $(\epsilon, \delta)$ certified unlearning and performance guarantees that establish the privacy-utility-complexity tradeoff of our algorithm, and we prove generalization guarantees for functions that satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing methods, within a new experimental framework that more accurately reflects unlearning user data in practice.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to structural interventions by deleting and swapping adjacent layers during inference. Surprisingly, models retain 72-95% of their original top-1 prediction accuracy without any fine-tuning. We find that performance degradation is not uniform across layers: interventions to the early and final layers cause the most degradation, while the model is remarkably robust to dropping middle layers. This pattern of localized sensitivity motivates our hypothesis of four stages of inference, observed across diverse model families and sizes: (1) detokenization, where local context is integrated to lift raw token embeddings into higher-level representations; (2) feature engineering, where task- and entity-specific features are iteratively refined; (3) prediction ensembling, where hidden states are aggregated into plausible next-token predictions; and (4) residual sharpening, where irrelevant features are suppressed to finalize the output distribution. Synthesizing behavioral and mechanistic evidence, we provide a framework for interpreting depth-dependent computations in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data fusion models based on Coupled Matrix and Tensor Factorizations (CMTF) have been effective tools for joint analysis of data from multiple sources. While the vast majority of CMTF models are based on the strictly multilinear CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor model, recently also the more flexible PARAFAC2 model has been integrated into CMTF models. PARAFAC2 tensor models can handle irregular/ragged tensors and have shown to be especially useful for modelling dynamic data with unaligned or irregular time profiles. However, existing PARAFAC2-based CMTF models have limitations in terms of possible regularizations on the factors and/or types of coupling between datasets. To address these limitations, in this paper we introduce a flexible algorithmic framework that fits PARAFAC2-based CMTF models using Alternating Optimization (AO) and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The proposed framework allows to impose various constraints on all modes and linear couplings to other matrix-, CP- or PARAFAC2-models. Experiments on various simulated and a real dataset demonstrate the utility and versatility of the proposed framework as well as its benefits in terms of accuracy and efficiency in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language is an intricately structured system, and a key goal of NLP interpretability is to provide methodological insights for understanding how language models represent this structure internally. In this paper, we use Shapley Taylor interaction indices (STII) in order to examine how language and speech models internally relate and structure their inputs. Pairwise Shapley interactions measure how much two inputs work together to influence model outputs beyond if we linearly added their independent influences, providing a view into how models encode structural interactions between inputs. We relate the interaction patterns in models to three underlying linguistic structures: syntactic structure, non-compositional semantics, and phonetic coarticulation. We find that autoregressive text models encode interactions that correlate with the syntactic proximity of inputs, and that both autoregressive and masked models encode nonlinear interactions in idiomatic phrases with non-compositional semantics. Our speech results show that inputs are more entangled for pairs where a neighboring consonant is likely to influence a vowel or approximant, showing that models encode the phonetic interaction needed for extracting discrete phonemic representations.

  Modeling spatial-temporal interactions among neighboring agents is at the heart of multi-agent problems such as motion forecasting and crowd navigation. Despite notable progress, it remains unclear to which extent modern representations can capture the causal relationships behind agent interactions. In this work, we take an in-depth look at the causal awareness of these representations, from computational formalism to real-world practice. First, we cast doubt on the notion of non-causal robustness studied in the recent CausalAgents benchmark. We show that recent representations are already partially resilient to perturbations of non-causal agents, and yet modeling indirect causal effects involving mediator agents remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a metric learning approach that regularizes latent representations with causal annotations. Our controlled experiments show that this approach not only leads to higher degrees of causal awareness but also yields stronger out-of-distribution robustness. To further operationalize it in practice, we propose a sim-to-real causal transfer method via cross-domain multi-task learning. Experiments on pedestrian datasets show that our method can substantially boost generalization, even in the absence of real-world causal annotations. We hope our work provides a new perspective on the challenges and pathways towards causally-aware representations of multi-agent interactions. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.

  The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based identity management.This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond centralized constraints.

  The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational use.

  Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents capable of autonomous learning and independent decision-making hold great promise for addressing complex challenges across various critical infrastructure domains, including transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, the surge in the design and deployment of AI systems, driven by various stakeholders with distinct and unaligned objectives, introduces a crucial challenge: How can uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments without creating chaos or compromising safety? To address this, we advocate for a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be empowered to adjust their objectives dynamically, make compromises, form coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and social feedback. Through two case studies in critical infrastructure applications, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and context-aware nature of these multi-agentic AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured environments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces during physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and easily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific solutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware, sensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a magnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly customizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a hobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired shape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled, parameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and its mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts convex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular design framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to adjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization experiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE of 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for shear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to unseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that improve manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving 91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy for successful completion. All design files, code and the CAD-to-eFlesh STL conversion tool are open-sourced and available onthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computing stabilizing and optimal control actions for legged locomotion in real time is difficult due to the nonlinear, hybrid, and high dimensional nature of these robots. The hybrid nature of the system introduces a combination of discrete and continuous variables which causes issues for numerical optimal control. To address these challenges, we propose a layered architecture that separates the choice of discrete variables and a smooth Model Predictive Controller (MPC). The layered formulation allows for online flexibility and optimality without sacrificing real-time performance through a combination of gradient-free and gradient-based methods. The architecture leverages a sampling-based method for determining discrete variables, and a classical smooth MPC formulation using these fixed discrete variables. We demonstrate the results on a quadrupedal robot stepping over gaps and onto terrain with varying heights. In simulation, we demonstrate the controller on a humanoid robot for gap traversal. The layered approach is shown to be more optimal and reliable than common heuristic-based approaches and faster to compute than pure sampling methods.

  While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$, and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe navigation of steerable and robotic catheters in the cerebral vasculature requires awareness of the catheters shape and pose. Currently, a significant perception burden is placed on interventionalists to mentally reconstruct and predict catheter motions from biplane fluoroscopy images. Efforts to track these catheters are limited to planar segmentation or bulky sensing instrumentation, which are incompatible with microcatheters used in neurointervention. In this work, a catheter is equipped with custom radiopaque markers arranged to enable simultaneous shape and pose estimation under biplane fluoroscopy. A design measure is proposed to guide the arrangement of these markers to minimize sensitivity to marker tracking uncertainty. This approach was deployed for microcatheters smaller than 2mm OD navigating phantom vasculature with shape tracking errors less than 1mm and catheter roll errors below 40 degrees. This work can enable steerable catheters to autonomously navigate under biplane imaging.

  One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile, "generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions, which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across 10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on closing the perception-to-action gap.

  The labeled MRPP (Multi-Robot Path Planning) problem involves routing robots from start to goal configurations efficiently while avoiding collisions. Despite progress in solution quality and runtime, its complexity and industrial relevance continue to drive research.This dissertation introduces scalable MRPP methods with provable guarantees and practical heuristics. First, we study dense MRPP on 2D grids, relevant to warehouse and parcel systems. We propose the Rubik Table method, achieving $(1 + \delta)$-optimal makespan (with $\delta \in (0, 0.5]$) for up to $\frac{m_1 m_2}{2}$ robots, solving large instances efficiently and setting a new theoretical benchmark.Next, we address real-world MRPP. We design optimal layouts for structured environments (e.g., warehouses, parking systems) and propose a puzzle-based system for dense, deadlock-free autonomous vehicle parking. We also extend MRPP to Reeds-Shepp robots, introducing motion primitives and smoothing techniques to ensure feasible, efficient paths under nonholonomic constraints. Simulations and real-world tests validate the approach in urban driving and robotic transport scenarios.

  In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for robot navigation in dynamic environments with heterogeneous constraints. Our approach leverages a graph neural network trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently estimate the robot's cost-to-go, formulated as local goal recommendations. A spatio-temporal path-searching module, which accounts for kinematic constraints, is then employed to generate a reference trajectory to facilitate solving the non-convex optimization problem used for explicit constraint enforcement. More importantly, we introduce an incremental action-masking mechanism and a privileged learning strategy, enabling end-to-end training of the proposed planner. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses local planning in complex dynamic environments, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared with existing learning-optimization hybrid methods, our approach eliminates the dependency on high-fidelity simulation environments, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency and training scalability. The code will be released as open-source upon acceptance of the paper.

  End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for directly mapping sensor inputs to planning maneuvers using learning-based modular integrations. However, existing imitation learning (IL)-based models suffer from generalization to hard cases, and a lack of corrective feedback loop under post-deployment. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential solution to tackle hard cases with optimality, it is often hindered by overfitting to specific driving cases, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge and sample inefficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose Reinforced Refinement with Self-aware Expansion (R2SE), a novel learning pipeline that constantly refines hard domain while keeping generalizable driving policy for model-agnostic end-to-end driving systems. Through reinforcement fine-tuning and policy expansion that facilitates continuous improvement, R2SE features three key components: 1) Generalist Pretraining with hard-case allocation trains a generalist imitation learning (IL) driving system while dynamically identifying failure-prone cases for targeted refinement; 2) Residual Reinforced Specialist Fine-tuning optimizes residual corrections using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in hard case domain while preserving global driving knowledge; 3) Self-aware Adapter Expansion dynamically integrates specialist policies back into the generalist model, enhancing continuous performance improvement. Experimental results in closed-loop simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate improvements in generalization, safety, and long-horizon policy robustness over state-of-the-art E2E systems, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforce refinement for scalable autonomous driving.

  Warehouse automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing operational efficiency, minimizing costs, and improving resilience to workforce variability. While prior research has demonstrated the potential of machine learning (ML) models to increase picking success rates in large-scale robotic fleets by prioritizing high-probability picks and packages, these efforts primarily focused on predicting success probabilities for picks sampled using heuristic methods. Limited attention has been given, however, to leveraging data-driven approaches to directly optimize sampled picks for better performance at scale. In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that predicts transform adjustments as well as improving the selection of suction cups for multi-suction end effectors for sampled picks to enhance their success probabilities. The framework was integrated and evaluated in test workcells that resemble the operations of Amazon Robotics' Robot Induction (Robin) fleet, which is used for package manipulation. Evaluated on over 2 million picks, the proposed method achieves a 20\% reduction in pick failure rates compared to a heuristic-based pick sampling baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale warehouse automation scenarios.

  Nowadays, industries are showing a growing interest in human-robot collaboration, particularly for shared tasks. This requires intelligent strategies to plan a robot's motions, considering both task constraints and human-specific factors such as height and movement preferences. This work introduces a novel approach to generate personalized trajectories using Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), enhanced with real-time velocity scaling based on human feedback. The method was rigorously tested in industrial-grade experiments, focusing on the collaborative transport of an engine cowl lip section. Comparative analysis between DMP-generated trajectories and a state-of-the-art motion planner (BiTRRT) highlights their adaptability combined with velocity scaling. Subjective user feedback further demonstrates a clear preference for DMP- based interactions. Objective evaluations, including physiological measurements from brain and skin activity, reinforce these findings, showcasing the advantages of DMPs in enhancing human-robot interaction and improving user experience.

  Autonomous racing has emerged as a crucial testbed for autonomous driving algorithms, necessitating a simulation environment for both vehicle dynamics and sensor behavior. Striking the right balance between vehicle dynamics and sensor accuracy is crucial for pushing vehicles to their performance limits. However, autonomous racing developers often face a trade-off between accurate vehicle dynamics and high-fidelity sensor simulations. This paper introduces R-CARLA, an enhancement of the CARLA simulator that supports holistic full-stack testing, from perception to control, using a single system. By seamlessly integrating accurate vehicle dynamics with sensor simulations, opponents simulation as NPCs, and a pipeline for creating digital twins from real-world robotic data, R-CARLA empowers researchers to push the boundaries of autonomous racing development. Furthermore, it is developed using CARLA's rich suite of sensor simulations. Our results indicate that incorporating the proposed digital-twin framework into R-CARLA enables more realistic full-stack testing, demonstrating a significant reduction in the Sim-to-Real gap of car dynamics simulation by 42% and by 82% in the case of sensor simulation across various testing scenarios.

  Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments.

  Dynamic locomotion of legged robots is a critical yet challenging topic in expanding the operational range of mobile robots. It requires precise planning when possible footholds are sparse, robustness against uncertainties and disturbances, and generalizability across diverse terrains. While traditional model-based controllers excel at planning on complex terrains, they struggle with real-world uncertainties. Learning-based controllers offer robustness to such uncertainties but often lack precision on terrains with sparse steppable areas. Hybrid methods achieve enhanced robustness on sparse terrains by combining both methods but are computationally demanding and constrained by the inherent limitations of model-based planners. To achieve generalized legged locomotion on diverse terrains while preserving the robustness of learning-based controllers, this paper proposes to learn an attention-based map encoding conditioned on robot proprioception, which is trained as part of the end-to-end controller using reinforcement learning. We show that the network learns to focus on steppable areas for future footholds when the robot dynamically navigates diverse and challenging terrains. We synthesize behaviors that exhibit robustness against uncertainties while enabling precise and agile traversal of sparse terrains. Additionally, our method offers a way to interpret the topographical perception of a neural network. We have trained two controllers for a 12-DoF quadrupedal robot and a 23-DoF humanoid robot respectively and tested the resulting controllers in the real world under various challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios, including ones unseen during training.

  Localization plays a crucial role in the navigation capabilities of autonomous robots, and while indoor environments can rely on wheel odometry and 2D LiDAR-based mapping, outdoor settings such as agriculture and forestry, present unique challenges that necessitate real-time localization and consistent mapping. Addressing this need, this paper introduces the VAULT prototype, a ROS 2-based mobile mapping system (MMS) that combines various sensors to enable robust outdoor and indoor localization. The proposed solution harnesses the power of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, visual-inertial odometry (VIO), inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to generate reliable 3D odometry. To further enhance the localization accuracy, Visual SLAM (VSLAM) is employed, resulting in the creation of a comprehensive 3D point cloud map. By leveraging these sensor technologies and advanced algorithms, the prototype offers a comprehensive solution for outdoor localization in autonomous mobile robots, enabling them to navigate and map their surroundings with confidence and precision.

The integration of these models in robotics can also help to improve several aspects such as human-robot interaction, navigation, planning and decision-making. Therefore, this paper introduces llama\_ros, a tool designed to integrate quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotic systems using ROS 2. Leveragingthis http URL, a highly optimized runtime engine, llama\_ros enables the efficient execution of quantized LLMs as edge artificial intelligence (AI) in robotics systems with resource-constrained environments, addressing the challenges of computational efficiency and memory limitations. By deploying quantized LLMs, llama\_ros empowers robots to leverage the natural language understanding and generation for enhanced decision-making and interaction which can be paired with prompt engineering, knowledge graphs, ontologies or other tools to improve the capabilities of autonomous robots. Additionally, this paper provides insights into some use cases of using llama\_ros for planning and explainability in robotics.

  The robust interpretation of 3D environments is crucial for human-robot collaboration (HRC) applications, where safety and operational efficiency are paramount. Semantic segmentation plays a key role in this context by enabling a precise and detailed understanding of the environment. Considering the intense data hunger for real-world industrial annotated data essential for effective semantic segmentation, this paper introduces a pioneering approach in the Sim2Real domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud data, specifically tailored for HRC. Our focus is on developing a network that robustly transitions from simulated environments to real-world applications, thereby enhancing its practical utility and impact on a safe HRC.In this work, we propose a dual-stream network architecture (FUSION) combining Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DGCNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) augmented with residual layers as a Sim2Real domain adaptation algorithm for an industrial environment. The proposed model was evaluated on real-world HRC setups and simulation industrial point clouds, it showed increased state-of-the-art performance, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 97.76%, and superior robustness compared to existing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information (foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain, and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics model} outperforms state-of-the-art works.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transparent and reflective objects in everyday environments pose significant challenges for depth sensors due to their unique visual properties, such as specular reflections and light transmission. These characteristics often lead to incomplete or inaccurate depth estimation, which severely impacts downstream geometry-based vision tasks, including object recognition, scene reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. To address the issue of missing depth information in transparent and reflective objects, we propose DCIRNet, a novel multimodal depth completion network that effectively integrates RGB images and depth maps to enhance depth estimation quality. Our approach incorporates an innovative multimodal feature fusion module designed to extract complementary information between RGB images and incomplete depth maps. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-stage supervision and depth refinement strategy that progressively improves depth completion and effectively mitigates the issue of blurred object boundaries. We integrate our depth completion model into dexterous grasping frameworks and achieve a $44\%$ improvement in the grasp success rate for transparent and reflective objects. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets, where DCIRNet demonstrates superior performance. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach and confirm its strong generalization capability across various transparent and reflective objects.

  Esophageal cancer remains a highly aggressive malignancy with low survival rates, requiring advanced surgical interventions like esophagectomy. Traditional manual techniques, including circular staplers, face challenges such as limited precision, prolonged recovery times, and complications like leaks and tissue misalignment. This paper presents a novel robotic circular stapler designed to enhance the dexterity in confined spaces, improve tissue alignment, and reduce post-operative risks. Integrated with a cognitive robot that serves as a surgeon's assistant, the surgical stapler uses three actuators to perform anvil motion, cutter/stapler motion and allows a 75-degree bending of the cartridge (distal tip). Kinematic analysis is used to compute the stapler tip's position, ensuring synchronization with a robotic system.

- **[Time-Unified Diffusion Policy with Action Discrimination for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09422)**  `arXiv:2506.09422`  
  _Ye Niu, Sanping Zhou, Yizhe Li, Ye Den, Le Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However, the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy (TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6% on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide range of real-world tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quadruped robots have made significant advances in locomotion, extending their capabilities from controlled environments to real-world applications. Beyond movement, recent work has explored loco-manipulation using the legs to perform tasks such as pressing buttons or opening doors. While these efforts demonstrate the feasibility of leg-based manipulation, most have focused on relatively static tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that enables quadruped robots to collect objects without additional actuators by leveraging the agility of their legs. By attaching a simple scoop-like add-on to one leg, the robot can scoop objects and toss them into a collection tray mounted on its back. Our method employs a hierarchical policy structure comprising two expert policies-one for scooping and tossing, and one for approaching object positions-and a meta-policy that dynamically switches between them. The expert policies are trained separately, followed by meta-policy training for coordinated multi-object collection. This approach demonstrates how quadruped legs can be effectively utilized for dynamic object manipulation, expanding their role beyond locomotion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Kinematic retargeting from human hands to robot hands is essential for transferring dexterity from humans to robots in manipulation teleoperation and imitation learning. However, due to mechanical differences between human and robot hands, completely reproducing human motions on robot hands is impossible. Existing works on retargeting incorporate various optimization objectives, focusing on different aspects of hand configuration. However, the lack of experimental comparative studies leaves the significance and effectiveness of these objectives unclear. This work aims to analyze these retargeting objectives for dexterous manipulation through extensive real-world comparative experiments. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive retargeting objective formulation that integrates intuitively crucial factors appearing in recent approaches. The significance of each factor is evaluated through experimental ablation studies on the full objective in kinematic posture retargeting and real-world teleoperated manipulation tasks. Experimental results and conclusions provide valuable insights for designing more accurate and effective retargeting algorithms for real-world dexterous manipulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humanoid robots hold significant potential in accomplishing daily tasks across diverse environments thanks to their flexibility and human-like morphology. Recent works have made significant progress in humanoid whole-body control and loco-manipulation leveraging optimal control or reinforcement learning. However, these methods require tedious task-specific tuning for each task to achieve satisfactory behaviors, limiting their versatility and scalability to diverse tasks in daily scenarios. To that end, we introduce SkillBlender, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for versatile humanoid loco-manipulation. SkillBlender first pretrains goal-conditioned task-agnostic primitive skills, and then dynamically blends these skills to accomplish complex loco-manipulation tasks with minimal task-specific reward engineering. We also introduce SkillBench, a parallel, cross-embodiment, and diverse simulated benchmark containing three embodiments, four primitive skills, and eight challenging loco-manipulation tasks, accompanied by a set of scientific evaluation metrics balancing accuracy and feasibility. Extensive simulated experiments show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines, while naturally regularizing behaviors to avoid reward hacking, resulting in more accurate and feasible movements for diverse loco-manipulation tasks in our daily scenarios. Our code and benchmark will be open-sourced to the community to facilitate future research. Project page:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction, visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10 demonstrations.

  _Yuemin Mao, Bardienus P. Duisterhof, Moonyoung Lee, Jeffrey Ichnowski_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object transport tasks are fundamental in robotic automation, emphasizing the importance of efficient and secure methods for moving objects. Non-prehensile transport can significantly improve transport efficiency, as it enables handling multiple objects simultaneously and accommodating objects unsuitable for parallel-jaw or suction grasps. Existing approaches incorporate constraints based on the Coulomb friction model, which is imprecise during fast motions where inherent mechanical vibrations occur. Imprecise constraints can cause transported objects to slide or even fall off the tray. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method to learn a friction model using acoustic sensing that maps a tray's motion profile to a dynamically conditioned friction coefficient. This learned model enables an optimization-based motion planner to adjust the friction constraint at each control step according to the planned motion at that step. In experiments, we generate time-optimized trajectories for a UR5e robot to transport various objects with constraints using both the standard Coulomb friction model and the learned friction model. Results suggest that the learned friction model reduces object displacement by up to 86.0% compared to the baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of acoustic sensing in learning real-world friction constraints.

  _Yangjie Cui, Boyang Gao, Yiwei Zhang, Xin Dong, Jinwu Xiang, Daochun Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Previous studies on event camera sensing have demonstrated certain detection performance using dense event representations. However, the accumulated noise in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16, which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse scenes, tasks, and robotic platforms when pretrained at large-scale datasets. However, these models still require task-specific fine-tuning in novel environments, a process that relies almost exclusively on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using static trajectory datasets. Such approaches neither allow robot to interact with environment nor do they leverage feedback from live execution. Also, their success is critically dependent on the size and quality of the collected trajectories. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling closed-loop interaction and aligning learned policies directly with task objectives. In this work, we draw inspiration from the ideas of GRPO and propose the Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) method. By fusing step-level and trajectory-level advantage signals, this method improves GRPO's group-level advantage estimation, thereby making the algorithm more suitable for online reinforcement learning training of VLA. Experimental results on ten manipulation tasks from the libero-object benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO consistently outperforms various baseline methods, capable of generating more robust and efficient policies across multiple tested scenarios.

  Recent advances in multimodal vision-language-action (VLA) models have revolutionized traditional robot learning, enabling systems to interpret vision, language, and action in unified frameworks for complex task planning. However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transforming complex actions into discrete skill abstractions has demonstrated strong potential for robotic manipulation. Existing approaches mainly leverage latent variable models, e.g., VQ-VAE, to learn skill abstractions through learned vectors (codebooks), while they suffer from codebook collapse and modeling the causal relationship between learned skills. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{S}kill \textbf{T}raining with \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{R}otation (\textbf{STAR}), a framework that advances both skill learning and composition to complete complex behaviors. Specifically, to prevent codebook collapse, we devise rotation-augmented residual skill quantization (RaRSQ). It encodes relative angles between encoder outputs into the gradient flow by rotation-based gradient mechanism. Points within the same skill code are forced to be either pushed apart or pulled closer together depending on gradient directions. Further, to capture the causal relationship between skills, we present causal skill transformer (CST) which explicitly models dependencies between skill representations through an autoregressive mechanism for coherent action generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of STAR on both LIBERO benchmark and realworld tasks, with around 12\% improvement over the baselines.

  Long-horizon robotic manipulation poses significant challenges for autonomous systems, requiring extended reasoning, precise execution, and robust error recovery across complex sequential tasks. Current approaches, whether based on static planning or end-to-end visuomotor policies, suffer from error accumulation and lack effective verification mechanisms during execution, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. We present Agentic Robot, a brain-inspired framework that addresses these limitations through Standardized Action Procedure (SAP)--a novel coordination protocol governing component interactions throughout manipulation tasks. Drawing inspiration from Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) in human organizations, SAP establishes structured workflows for planning, execution, and verification phases. Our architecture comprises three specialized components: (1) a large reasoning model that decomposes high-level instructions into semantically coherent subgoals, (2) a vision-language-action executor that generates continuous control commands from real-time visual inputs, and (3) a temporal verifier that enables autonomous progression and error recovery through introspective assessment. This SAP-driven closed-loop design supports dynamic self-verification without external supervision. On the LIBERO benchmark, Agentic Robot achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average success rate of 79.6%, outperforming SpatialVLA by 6.1% and OpenVLA by 7.4% on long-horizon tasks. These results demonstrate that SAP-driven coordination between specialized components enhances both performance and interpretability in sequential manipulation, suggesting significant potential for reliable autonomous systems.

  We propose ReinFlow, a simple yet effective online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that fine-tunes a family of flow matching policies for continuous robotic control. Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants, including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%.

  This paper addresses motion replanning in human-robot collaborative scenarios, emphasizing reactivity and safety-compliant efficiency. While existing human-aware motion planners are effective in structured environments, they often struggle with unpredictable human behavior, leading to safety measures that limit robot performance and throughput. In this study, we combine reactive path replanning and a safety-aware cost function, allowing the robot to adjust its path to changes in the human state. This solution reduces the execution time and the need for trajectory slowdowns without sacrificing safety. Simulations and real-world experiments show the method's effectiveness compared to standard human-robot cooperation approaches, with efficiency enhancements of up to 60\%.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made them powerful tools in embodied navigation, enabling agents to leverage commonsense and spatial reasoning for efficient exploration in unfamiliar environments. Existing LLM-based approaches convert global memory, such as semantic or topological maps, into language descriptions to guide navigation. While this improves efficiency and reduces redundant exploration, the loss of geometric information in language-based representations hinders spatial reasoning, especially in intricate environments. To address this, VLM-based approaches directly process ego-centric visual inputs to select optimal directions for exploration. However, relying solely on a first-person perspective makes navigation a partially observed decision-making problem, leading to suboptimal decisions in complex environments. In this paper, we present a novel vision-language model (VLM)-based navigation framework that addresses these challenges by adaptively retrieving task-relevant cues from a global memory module and integrating them with the agent's egocentric observations. By dynamically aligning global contextual information with local perception, our approach enhances spatial reasoning and decision-making in long-horizon tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in object navigation tasks, providing a more effective and scalable solution for embodied navigation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Soft robots can revolutionize several applications with high demands on dexterity and safety. When operating these systems, real-time estimation and control require fast and accurate models. However, prediction with first-principles (FP) models is slow, and learned black-box models have poor generalizability. Physics-informed machine learning offers excellent advantages here, but it is currently limited to simple, often simulated systems without considering changes after training. We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for articulated soft robots (ASRs) with a focus on data efficiency. The amount of expensive real-world training data is reduced to a minimum -- one dataset in one system domain. Two hours of data in different domains are used for a comparison against two gold-standard approaches: In contrast to a recurrent neural network, the PINN provides a high generalizability. The prediction speed of an accurate FP model is exceeded with the PINN by up to a factor of 467 at slightly reduced accuracy. This enables nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) of a pneumatic ASR. Accurate position tracking with the MPC running at 47 Hz is achieved in six dynamic experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are sensors that provide robustness against adverse weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, etc.), and as such they are increasingly being used for odometry and SLAM applications. However, the noisy and sparse nature of the returned scan data proves to be a challenging obstacle for existing point cloud matching based solutions, especially those originally intended for more accurate sensors such as LiDAR. Inspired by visual odometry research around 3D Gaussian Splatting, in this paper we propose using freely positioned 3D Gaussians to create a summarized representation of a radar point cloud tolerant to sensor noise, and subsequently leverage its inherent probability distribution function for registration (similar to NDT). Moreover, we propose simultaneously optimizing multiple scan matching hypotheses in order to further increase the robustness of the system against local optima of the function. Finally, we fuse our Gaussian modeling and scan matching algorithms into an EKF radar-inertial odometry system designed after current best practices. Experiments using publicly available 4D radar datasets show that our Gaussian-based odometry is comparable to existing registration algorithms, outperforming them in several sequences.

Traditional single-vehicle intelligence systems often perform poorly in such environments due to a lack of global traffic flow information and the ability to respond to unexpected events. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, through real-time communication between vehicles (V2V) and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I), offers a robust solution. However, practical applications still face numerous challenges. Calibration among heterogeneous vehicle and infrastructure endpoints in multi-end LiDAR systems is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of perception system data. Most existing multi-end calibration methods rely on initial calibration values provided by positioning systems, but the instability of GPS signals due to high buildings in urban canyons poses severe challenges to these methods. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-end LiDAR system calibration method that does not require positioning priors to determine initial external parameters and meets real-time requirements. Our method introduces an innovative multi-end perception object association technique, utilizing a new Overall Distance metric (oDist) to measure the spatial association between perception objects, and effectively combines global consistency search algorithms with optimal transport theory. By this means, we can extract co-observed targets from object association results for further external parameter computation and optimization. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments conducted on the simulated dataset V2X-Sim and the real dataset DAIR-V2X confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

  End-effector based assistive robots face persistent challenges in generating smooth and robust trajectories when controlled by human's noisy and unreliable biosignals such as muscle activities and brainwaves. The produced endpoint trajectories are often jerky and imprecise to perform complex tasks such as stable robotic grasping. We propose STREAMS (Self-Training Robotic End-to-end Adaptive Multimodal Shared autonomy) as a novel framework leveraged deep reinforcement learning to tackle this challenge in biosignal based robotic control systems. STREAMS blends environmental information and synthetic user input into a Deep Q Learning Network (DQN) pipeline for an interactive end-to-end and self-training mechanism to produce smooth trajectories for the control of end-effector based robots. The proposed framework achieved a high-performance record of 98% in simulation with dynamic target estimation and acquisition without any pre-existing datasets. As a zero-shot sim-to-real user study with five participants controlling a physical robotic arm with noisy head movements, STREAMS (as an assistive mode) demonstrated significant improvements in trajectory stabilization, user satisfaction, and task performance reported as a success rate of 83% compared to manual mode which was 44% without any task support. STREAMS seeks to improve biosignal based assistive robotic controls by offering an interactive, end-to-end solution that stabilizes end-effector trajectories, enhancing task performance and accuracy.

  We introduce RMP-YOLO, a unified framework designed to provide robust motion predictions even with incomplete input data. Our key insight stems from the observation that complete and reliable historical trajectory data plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate motion prediction. Therefore, we propose a new paradigm that prioritizes the reconstruction of intact historical trajectories before feeding them into the prediction modules. Our approach introduces a novel scene tokenization module to enhance the extraction and fusion of spatial and temporal features. Following this, our proposed recovery module reconstructs agents' incomplete historical trajectories by leveraging local map topology and interactions with nearby agents. The reconstructed, clean historical data is then integrated into the downstream prediction modules. Our framework is able to effectively handle missing data of varying lengths and remains robust against observation noise, while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, our recovery module is compatible with existing prediction models, ensuring seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, and deployment in real-world autonomous vehicles confirms its practical utility. In the 2024 Waymo Motion Prediction Competition, our method, RMP-YOLO, achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing third place.

  In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown its effectiveness in solving complex continuous control tasks. However, this comes at the cost of an enormous amount of experience required for training, exacerbated by the sensitivity of learning efficiency and the policy performance to hyperparameter selection, which often requires numerous trials of time-consuming experiments. This work leverages a Population-Based Reinforcement Learning (PBRL) approach and a GPU-accelerated physics simulator to enhance the exploration capabilities of RL by concurrently training multiple policies in parallel. The PBRL framework is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art RL algorithms -- PPO, SAC, and DDPG -- dynamically adjusting hyperparameters based on the performance of learning agents. The experiments are performed on four challenging tasks in Isaac Gym -- Anymal Terrain, Shadow Hand, Humanoid, Franka Nut Pick -- by analyzing the effect of population size and mutation mechanisms for hyperparameters. The results show that PBRL agents achieve superior performance, in terms of cumulative reward, compared to non-evolutionary baseline agents. Moreover, the trained agents are finally deployed in the real world for a Franka Nut Pick task. To our knowledge, this is the first sim-to-real attempt for deploying PBRL agents on real hardware. Code and videos of the learned policies are available on our project website (this https URL).

  Mobile robots require knowledge of the environment, especially of humans located in its vicinity. While the most common approaches for detecting humans involve computer vision, an often overlooked hardware feature of robots for people detection are their 2D range finders. These were originally intended for obstacle avoidance and mapping/SLAM tasks. In most robots, they are conveniently located at a height approximately between the ankle and the knee, so they can be used for detecting people too, and with a larger field of view and depth resolution compared to cameras.In this paper, we present a new dataset for people detection using knee-high 2D range finders called FROG. This dataset has greater laser resolution, scanning frequency, and more complete annotation data compared to existing datasets such as DROW. Particularly, the FROG dataset contains annotations for 100% of its laser scans (unlike DROW which only annotates 5%), 17x more annotated scans, 100x more people annotations, and over twice the distance traveled by the robot. We propose a benchmark based on the FROG dataset, and analyze a collection of state-of-the-art people detectors based on 2D range finder data.We also propose and evaluate a new end-to-end deep learning approach for people detection. Our solution works with the raw sensor data directly (not needing hand-crafted input data features), thus avoiding CPU preprocessing and releasing the developer of understanding specific domain heuristics. Experimental results show how the proposed people detector attains results comparable to the state of the art, while an optimized implementation for ROS can operate at more than 500 Hz.
