- **[DeepResearch$^{\text{Eco}}$: A Recursive Agentic Workflow for Complex Scientific Question Answering in Ecology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10522)**  `arXiv:2507.10522`  
  _Jennifer D'Souza, Endres Keno Sander, Andrei Aioanei_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce DeepResearch$^{\text{Eco}}$, a novel agentic LLM-based system for automated scientific synthesis that supports recursive, depth- and breadth-controlled exploration of original research questions -- enhancing search diversity and nuance in the retrieval of relevant scientific literature. Unlike conventional retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, DeepResearch enables user-controllable synthesis with transparent reasoning and parameter-driven configurability, facilitating high-throughput integration of domain-specific evidence while maintaining analytical rigor. Applied to 49 ecological research questions, DeepResearch achieves up to a 21-fold increase in source integration and a 14.9-fold rise in sources integrated per 1,000 words. High-parameter settings yield expert-level analytical depth and contextual diversity.Source code available at:this https URL.

- **[Acquiring and Adapting Priors for Novel Tasks via Neural Meta-Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10446)**  `arXiv:2507.10446`  
  _Sudarshan Babu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks stands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and computational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning, where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where, due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction, addressing critical challenges in computational immunology

- **[Instance space analysis of the capacitated vehicle routing problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10397)**  `arXiv:2507.10397`  
  _Alessandra M. M. M. Gouv√™a, Nuno Paulos, Eduardo Uchoa e Mari√° C. V. Nascimento_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper seeks to advance CVRP research by addressing the challenge of understanding the nuanced relationships between instance characteristics and metaheuristic (MH) performance. We present Instance Space Analysis (ISA) as a valuable tool that allows for a new perspective on the field. By combining the ISA methodology with a dataset from the DIMACS 12th Implementation Challenge on Vehicle Routing, our research enabled the identification of 23 relevant instance characteristics. Our use of the PRELIM, SIFTED, and PILOT stages, which employ dimensionality reduction and machine learning methods, allowed us to create a two-dimensional projection of the instance space to understand how the structure of instances affect the behavior of MHs. A key contribution of our work is that we provide a projection matrix, which makes it straightforward to incorporate new instances into this analysis and allows for a new method for instance analysis in the CVRP field.

- **[Should We Ever Prefer Decision Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10174)**  `arXiv:2507.10174`  
  _Yumi Omori, Zixuan Dong, Keith Ross_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these, Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al. (2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in sparse-reward and low-quality data settings.In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks (Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments. From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?

- **[Introducing the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph: AI for Context-Aware Nutrition Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10156)**  `arXiv:2507.10156`  
  _Lubnaa Abdur Rahman, Ioannis Papathanail, Stavroula Mougiakakou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through multimedia-based automatic dietary assessment. However, existing automatic dietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as recipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter nutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including allergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In Switzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains fragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant nutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we introduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our best knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with nutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national nutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment pipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first benchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge augmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the graph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe recommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and dietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional guidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the SwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer user-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by comparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such, our work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment tools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating.

- **[Adaptability in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Framework and Unified Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10142)**  `arXiv:2507.10142`  
  _Siyi Hu, Mohamad A Hady, Jianglin Qiao, Jimmy Cao, Mahardhika Pratama, Ryszard Kowalczyk_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown clear effectiveness in coordinating multiple agents across simulated benchmarks and constrained scenarios. However, its deployment in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS) remains limited, primarily due to the complex and dynamic nature of such environments. These challenges arise from multiple interacting sources of variability, including fluctuating agent populations, evolving task goals, and inconsistent execution conditions. Together, these factors demand that MARL algorithms remain effective under continuously changing system configurations and operational demands. To better capture and assess this capacity for adjustment, we introduce the concept of \textit{adaptability} as a unified and practically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL algorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the environment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on the notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three key dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven adaptability. By adopting this adaptability perspective, we aim to support more principled assessments of MARL performance beyond narrowly defined benchmarks. Ultimately, this survey contributes to the development of algorithms that are better suited for deployment in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.

- **[FRSICL: LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning Flight Resource Allocation for Fresh Data Collection in UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10134)**  `arXiv:2507.10134`  
  _Yousef Emami, Hao Zhou, Miguel Gutierrez Gaitan, Kai Li, Luis Almeida_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vital for public safety, particularly in wildfire monitoring, where early detection minimizes environmental impact. In UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor transmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of Information (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling efficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it unsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper introduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and data collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.

- **[Could you be wrong: Debiasing LLMs using a metacognitive prompt for improving human decision making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10124)**  `arXiv:2507.10124`  
  _Thomas T. Hills_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development, what is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies for debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge into awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if prompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show promise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?" Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases, contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their initial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and users interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. "Could you be wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent metacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive prompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based improvements to human decision making.

- **[Analysis of AI Techniques for Orchestrating Edge-Cloud Application Migration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10119)**  `arXiv:2507.10119`  
  _Sadig Gojayev, Ahmad Anaqreh, Carolina Fortuna_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Application migration in edge-cloud system enables high QoS and cost effective service delivery. However, automatically orchestrating such migration is typically solved with heuristic approaches. Starting from the Markov Decision Process (MDP), in this paper, we identify, analyze and compare selected state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for solving the class of edge-cloud application migration problems that can be modeled as Towers of Hanoi (ToH) problems. We introduce a new classification based on state space definition and analyze the compared models also through this lense. The aim is to understand available techniques capable of orchestrating such application migration in emerging computing continuum environments.

- **[BlueGlass: A Framework for Composite AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10106)**  `arXiv:2507.10106`  
  _Harshal Nandigramwar, Syed Qutub, Kay-Ulrich Scholl_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AI systems become increasingly capable and ubiquitous, ensuring the safety of these systems is critical. However, existing safety tools often target different aspects of model safety and cannot provide full assurance in isolation, highlighting a need for integrated and composite methodologies. This paper introduces BlueGlass, a framework designed to facilitate composite AI safety workflows by providing a unified infrastructure enabling the integration and composition of diverse safety tools that operate across model internals and outputs. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of this framework, we present three safety-oriented analyses on vision-language models for the task of object detection: (1) distributional evaluation, revealing performance trade-offs and potential failure modes across distributions; (2) probe-based analysis of layer dynamics highlighting shared hierarchical learning via phase transition; and (3) sparse autoencoders identifying interpretable concepts. More broadly, this work contributes foundational infrastructure and findings for building more robust and reliable AI systems.

- **[On Gradual Semantics for Assumption-Based Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10076)**  `arXiv:2507.10076`  
  _Anna Rapberger, Fabrizio Russo, Antonio Rago, Francesca Toni_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In computational argumentation, gradual semantics are fine-grained alternatives to extension-based and labelling-based semantics . They ascribe a dialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of acceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract, bipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as, to a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this has not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it being a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications where gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which are the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do so, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of (potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular gradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy suitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as balance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that leverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline. Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our gradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess convergence.

- **[Automating SPARQL Query Translations between DBpedia and Wikidata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10045)**  `arXiv:2507.10045`  
  _Malte Christian Bartels, Debayan Banerjee, Ricardo Usbeck_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) can automatically translate SPARQL between popular Knowledge Graph (KG) schemas. We focus on translations between the DBpedia and Wikidata KG, and later on DBLP and OpenAlex KG. This study addresses a notable gap in KG interoperability research by rigorously evaluating LLM performance on SPARQL-to-SPARQL translation. Two benchmarks are assembled, where the first align 100 DBpedia-Wikidata queries from QALD-9-Plus; the second contains 100 DBLP queries aligned to OpenAlex, testing generalizability beyond encyclopaedic KGs. Three open LLMs: Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are selected based on their sizes and architectures and tested with zero-shot, few-shot, and two chain-of-thought variants. Outputs were compared with gold answers, and resulting errors were categorized. We find that the performance varies markedly across models and prompting strategies, and that translations for Wikidata to DBpedia work far better than translations for DBpedia to Wikidata.

- **[Deep Hidden Cognition Facilitates Reliable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10007)**  `arXiv:2507.10007`  
  _Zijun Chen, Wenbo Hu, Richang Hong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning has demonstrated remarkable deep reasoning capabilities in both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, its reliability is often undermined by the accumulation of errors in intermediate steps. This paper introduces an novel approach to calibrate the CoT reasoning accuracy by leveraging the model's intrinsic veracity encoding. We discover that specific attention head activations reliably reflect the truthfulness of reasoning steps in CoT. Based on this insight, we train a confidence predictor to evaluate the correctness of each reasoning step using these truthfulness-sensitive activations, dynamically selecting the most plausible reasoning path via beam search. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and Self-Evaluation Guided Beam Search) across the mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning tasks, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability in both unimodal and multimodal settings. We further validate the approach on large reasoning models, confirming its applicability to specialized reasoning models. Additionally, we explore the role of the model's self-correction ability in CoT reasoning. This work provides a novel reliability improvement path for CoT reasoning with broad application potential.

- **[On The Role of Intentionality in Knowledge Representation: Analyzing Scene Context for Cognitive Agents with a Tiny Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10000)**  `arXiv:2507.10000`  
  _Mark Burgess_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Since Searle's work deconstructing intent and intentionality in the realm of philosophy, the practical meaning of intent has received little attention in science and technology. Intentionality and context are both central to the scope of Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime, used as an effective Tiny Language Model. One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low level (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence as a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent `intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and assessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort parts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime coherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation of latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference to extensive training or reasoning capabilities. The process is well within the reach of basic organisms as it does not require large scale artificial probabilistic batch processing. The level of concept formation depends, however, on the memory capacity of the agent.

- **[Improving monotonic optimization in heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning with optimal marginal deterministic policy gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09989)**  `arXiv:2507.09989`  
  _Xiaoyang Yu, Youfang Lin, Shuo Wang, Sheng Han_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving monotonic improvement plays a pivotal role in enhancing performance. The HAPPO algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS). However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing (ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG) algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$ with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\phi_{\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC) as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate that OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.

  _Luolin Xiong, Haofen Wang, Xi Chen, Lu Sheng, Yun Xiong, Jingping Liu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  DeepSeek, a Chinese Artificial Intelligence (AI) startup, has released their V3 and R1 series models, which attracted global attention due to their low cost, high performance, and open-source advantages. This paper begins by reviewing the evolution of large AI models focusing on paradigm shifts, the mainstream Large Language Model (LLM) paradigm, and the DeepSeek paradigm. Subsequently, the paper highlights novel algorithms introduced by DeepSeek, including Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The paper then explores DeepSeek engineering breakthroughs in LLM scaling, training, inference, and system-level optimization architecture. Moreover, the impact of DeepSeek models on the competitive AI landscape is analyzed, comparing them to mainstream LLMs across various fields. Finally, the paper reflects on the insights gained from DeepSeek innovations and discusses future trends in the technical and engineering development of large AI models, particularly in data, training, and reasoning.

- **[VerifyBench: A Systematic Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning Verifiers Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09884)**  `arXiv:2507.09884`  
  _Xuzhao Li, Xuchen Li, Shiyu Hu, Yongzhen Guo, Wentao Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced. Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.

  _Aniruddha Chattopadhyay, Raj Dandekar, Kaushik Roy_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems combine neural network and classical symbolic AI mechanisms to exploit the complementary strengths of large scale, generalizable learning and robust, verifiable reasoning. Numerous classifications of neurosymbolic AI illustrate how these two components can be integrated in distinctly different ways. In this work, we propose reinterpreting instruction tuned large language models as model grounded symbolic AI systems where natural language serves as the symbolic layer and grounding is achieved through the models internal representation space. Within this framework, we investigate and develop novel learning and reasoning approaches that preserve structural similarities to traditional learning and reasoning paradigms. Preliminary evaluations across axiomatic deductive reasoning procedures of varying complexity provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach in improving learning efficiency and reasoning reliability.

- **[Is Human-Written Data Enough? The Challenge of Teaching Reasoning to LLMs Without RL or Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09850)**  `arXiv:2507.09850`  
  _Wei Du, Branislav Kisacanin, George Armstrong, Shubham Toshniwal, Ivan Moshkov, Alexan Ayrapetyan, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20 long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However, neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain, we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.

- **[Causality-informed Anomaly Detection in Partially Observable Sensor Networks: Moving beyond Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09742)**  `arXiv:2507.09742`  
  _Xiaofeng Xiao, Bo Shen, Xubo Yue_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume of data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due to limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to detect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal sensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system while detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been proposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider only variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover, although a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on interventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which is impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we introduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for partially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating causal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves faster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the trained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for anomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor placement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current implementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various reinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world causality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.

- **[Towards Concise and Adaptive Thinking in Large Reasoning Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09662)**  `arXiv:2507.09662`  
  _Jason Zhu, Hongyu Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics and programming with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning sequences (slow-thinking), compared with traditional large language models (fast-thinking). However, these reasoning models also face a huge challenge that generating unnecessarily lengthy and redundant reasoning chains even for trivial questions. This phenomenon leads to a significant waste of inference resources, increases the response time for simple queries, and hinders the practical application of LRMs in real-world products. To this end, it is crucial to shorten lengthy reasoning chains and learn adaptive reasoning between fast and slow thinking based on input difficulty. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in concise and adaptive thinking for efficient reasoning of LRMs, including methodologies, benchmarks, and challenges for future exploration. We hope this survey can help researchers quickly understand the landscape of this field and inspire novel adaptive thinking ideas to facilitate better usage of LRMs.

  Personal service robots are deployed to support daily living in domestic environments, particularly for elderly and individuals requiring assistance. These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks, and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems rely on proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software, resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast, multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data, ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1 and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform other models. However, our findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results, highlighting the critical role of the integration strategy in generating ontology-compliant KGs.

  We present eSapiens, an AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) platform engineered around a business-oriented trifecta: proprietary data, operational workflows, and any major agnostic Large Language Model (LLM). eSapiens gives businesses full control over their AI assets, keeping everything in-house for AI knowledge retention and data security. eSapiens AI Agents (Sapiens) empower your team by providing valuable insights and automating repetitive tasks, enabling them to focus on high-impact work and drive better business outcomes.The system integrates structured document ingestion, hybrid vector retrieval, and no-code orchestration via LangChain, and supports top LLMs including OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. A key component is the THOR Agent, which handles structured SQL-style queries and generates actionable insights over enterprise databases.To evaluate the system, we conduct two experiments. First, a retrieval benchmark on legal corpora reveals that a chunk size of 512 tokens yields the highest retrieval precision (Top-3 accuracy: 91.3%). Second, a generation quality test using TRACe metrics across five LLMs shows that eSapiens delivers more context-consistent outputs with up to a 23% improvement in factual alignment.These results demonstrate the effectiveness of eSapiens in enabling trustworthy, auditable AI workflows for high-stakes domains like legal and finance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired, energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-time control systems. However, their training presents several challenges, particularly for reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, due to the non-differentiable nature of spike-based communication. In this work, we introduce what is, to our knowledge, the first framework that employs Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling, a Bayesian inference technique, to train SNNs for dynamical agent control in RL environments without relying on gradient-based methods. Our approach iteratively proposes and probabilistically accepts network parameter updates based on accumulated reward signals, effectively circumventing the limitations of backpropagation while enabling direct optimization on neuromorphic platforms. We evaluated this framework on two standard control benchmarks: AcroBot and CartPole. The results demonstrate that our MH-based approach outperforms conventional Deep Q-Learning (DQL) baselines and prior SNN-based RL approaches in terms of maximizing the accumulated reward while minimizing network resources and training episodes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline model-based reinforcement learning method that leverages the recently proposed Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) for efficient trajectory optimization. While prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still perform poorly on scientific tasks, particularly those requiring multi-step and interpretable reasoning. Their limitations include insufficient scientific reasoning patterns, lack of global coherence in multi-step inference, and the absence of reflective self-correction, making them unreliable in structured scientific contexts. We introduce EduFlow, the first end-to-end framework that covers the full pipeline of educational scientific reasoning, including data selection, MCTS-based trajectory construction, model training, and output optimization. At its core is EduPRM, a process-aware reward model that critiques reasoning steps with tags and justifications. EduPRM is trained via curriculum learning on three complementary supervision sources: MCTS-guided trajectories, error-injected critiques, and teacher-student dialogues, enabling dynamic adaptation to multi-stage problem solving and iterative refinement during inference. We further propose EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework that introduces bootstrapping actions specifically designed for educational reasoning, such as a self-reflection mechanism that promotes reflective error correction. It further leverages EduPRM's fine-grained feedback to guide the search toward higher-quality reasoning trajectories. By applying self-consistency and rejection sampling, we constructed EduMCTS-160K, a large-scale dataset of educational reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EduFlow enhances reasoning consistency and coherence. Code, data, and models will be released.

  The accelerating loss of biodiversity presents critical challenges for ecological research and conservation strategies. The preservation of biodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the sustainability of ecosystems. However, biodiversity faces numerous threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and the proliferation of invasive species. Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local and global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and conservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation Models (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by leveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to various downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity conservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model tailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning. BioAnalyst employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multi-modal datasets encompassing species occurrence records, remote sensing indicators, climate and environmental variables. BioAnalyst is designed for adaptability, allowing for fine-tuning of a range of downstream tasks, such as species distribution modelling, habitat suitability assessments, invasive species detection, and population trend forecasting. We evaluate the model's performance on two downstream use cases, demonstrating its generalisability compared to existing methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios for two distinct use-cases, establishing a new accuracy baseline for ecological forecasting. By openly releasing BioAnalyst and its fine-tuning workflows to the scientific community, we aim to foster collaborative efforts in biodiversity modelling and advance AI-driven solutions to pressing ecological challenges.

  Generative AI can be used in multi-actor environments with purposes ranging from social science modeling to interactive narrative and AI evaluation. Supporting this diversity of use cases -- which we classify as Simulationist, Dramatist, and Evaluationist -- demands a flexible scenario definition framework. We argue here that a good approach is to take inspiration from tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), where a Game Master (GM) is responsible for the environment and generates all parts of the story not directly determined by the voluntary actions of player characters. We argue that the Entity-Component architectural pattern is useful here. In such a system, the GM is not a hardcoded computer game but is itself a configurable entity, composed of components just like any other actor. By design, the approach allows for a separation between the underlying implementation details handled by an engineer, the creation of reusable components, and their composition and configuration managed by a designer who constructs entities from the components. This separation of concerns is instrumental for achieving rapid iteration, maintaining modularity, and ultimately to ensure scalability. We describe the ongoing evolution of the Concordia library in terms of this philosophy, demonstrating how it allows users to effectively configure scenarios that align with their specific goals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern methods for multi-criteria assessment (MCA), such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM), are utilized to appraise a collection of Decision-Making Units (DMUs), also known as alternatives, based on several criteria. These methodologies inherently rely on assumptions and can be influenced by subjective judgment to effectively tackle the complex evaluation challenges in various fields. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria as they consist of cardinal and ordinal data. Despite the inherent variability in the criterion values of different alternatives, the homogeneity assumption is often employed, significantly affecting evaluations. To tackle these challenges and determine the most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models. The VGA framework, rooted in linear programming, is pivotal in the MCA methodology. This approach improves efficiency and fairness, ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and dependable, thus offering a strong and adaptive solution. Two comprehensive numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and transparency of our proposed method. The goal is to encourage continued advancement and stimulate progress in automated decision systems and decision support systems.

  Recent large language models have shown promising capabilities in long-form reasoning, following structured chains of thought before arriving at a final answer. However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include substantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention scores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater attention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing this redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance through clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we systematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention scores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit instruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore, we propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in low-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting redundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then resume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any training involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where reasoning redundancy is more prevalent.

  Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data. To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug discovery.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy. Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text, significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks, MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering, 15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8% improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP. MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream applications.

  Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

  Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect (ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves "imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts. Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual counterfactuals (non-actual).

  Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

  Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.

  Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI safety systems face the dual-use dilemma. It is unclear whether to answer dual-use requests, since the same query could be either harmless or harmful depending on who made it and why. To make better decisions, such systems would need to examine requests' real-world context, but currently, they lack access to this information. Instead, they sometimes end up making arbitrary choices that result in refusing legitimate queries and allowing harmful ones, which hurts both utility and safety. To address this, we propose a conceptual framework based on access controls where only verified users can access dual-use outputs. We describe the framework's components, analyse its feasibility, and explain how it addresses both over-refusals and under-refusals. While only a high-level proposal, our work takes the first step toward giving model providers more granular tools for managing dual-use content. Such tools would enable users to access more capabilities without sacrificing safety, and offer regulators new options for targeted policies.

  Recent advances in automated theorem proving (ATP) through LLMs have highlighted the potential of formal reasoning with Lean 4 codes. However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in natural languages. To begin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.

However, they still fall short of achieving human-like sample efficiency and adaptability when learning new domains. Theory-based reinforcement learning (TBRL) is an algorithmic framework specifically designed to address this gap. Modeled on cognitive theories, TBRL leverages structured, causal world models - "theories" - as forward simulators for use in planning, generalization and exploration. Although current TBRL systems provide compelling explanations of how humans learn to play video games, they face several technical limitations: their theory languages are restrictive, and their planning algorithms are not scalable. To address these challenges, we introduce TheoryCoder, an instantiation of TBRL that exploits hierarchical representations of theories and efficient program synthesis methods for more powerful learning and planning. TheoryCoder equips agents with general-purpose abstractions (e.g., "move to"), which are then grounded in a particular environment by learning a low-level transition model (a Python program synthesized from observations by a large language model). A bilevel planning algorithm can exploit this hierarchical structure to solve large domains. We demonstrate that this approach can be successfully applied to diverse and challenging grid-world games, where approaches based on directly synthesizing a policy perform poorly. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of using hierarchical abstractions.

  Leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to build collaborative multi-agentic workflows has demonstrated significant potential. However, most previous studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their innate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs' performance as shown recently. In this paper, we introduce a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL (Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash the power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first generate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn discussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL verifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score that verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to encourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the co-training reward, and is then maximized through multi-agent RL. Unlike existing LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of multiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by analytical insights, our experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs alone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast, multi-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across benchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains.

  Robustness of reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models, and addressing it is essential for the practical applicability of AI-driven reasoning systems. We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.

  Extending the context length of Language Models (LMs) by improving Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has become a trend. While prior works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention, this paper uncovers the adverse effects on length generalization from nearly all parts of LMs. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectrum damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs \textit{Fourier Series} and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales and benchmarks show that, within varying context windows, FoPE maintains a more stable performance compared to other baselines. Several analyses and ablations bring further support to our method and theoretical modeling.

  Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for tool planning has emerged as a promising avenue for developing general AI systems, where LLMs automatically schedule external tools (e.g., vision models) to tackle complex tasks based on task descriptions. To push this paradigm toward practical applications, it is crucial for LLMs to consider tool execution costs (e.g., execution time) for tool planning. Unfortunately, prior studies overlook the tool execution costs, leading to the generation of expensive plans whose costs outweigh their benefits in terms of task performance. To fill this gap, we propose the Cost-Aware Tool Planning with LLMs (CATP-LLM) framework, which for the first time provides a coherent design to empower LLMs for cost-aware tool planning. Specifically, To facilitate efficient concurrent tool execution and cost reduction, we design a tool planning language to enhance the LLM for creating multi-branch non-sequential plans. Moreover, we propose a cost-aware offline reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the LLM to optimize the performance-cost trade-off in tool planning. In the lack of public cost-related datasets, we further present OpenCATP, the first dataset for cost-aware planning, which comprises 11,100 evaluation samples from diverse tasks. Extensive experiments show that CATP-LLM outperforms GPT-4 even when using Llama2-7B as its backbone, with the average improvement of 1.5%-93.9% in terms of plan quality.

  Recently, newly developed Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI's o1, have emerged, seemingly demonstrating advanced reasoning capabilities across text and image modalities. However, the depth of these advances in language-guided perception and abstract reasoning remains underexplored, and it is unclear whether these models can truly live up to their ambitious promises. To assess the progress and identify shortcomings, we enter the wonderland of Bongard problems, a set of classic visual reasoning puzzles that require human-like abilities of pattern recognition and abstract reasoning. With our extensive evaluation setup, we show that while VLMs occasionally succeed in identifying discriminative concepts and solving some of the problems, they frequently falter. Surprisingly, even elementary concepts that may seem trivial to humans, such as simple spirals, pose significant challenges. Moreover, when explicitly asked to recognize ground truth concepts, they continue to falter, suggesting not only a lack of understanding of these elementary visual concepts but also an inability to generalize to unseen concepts. We compare the results of VLMs to human performance and observe that a significant gap remains between human visual reasoning capabilities and machine cognition.

  With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), aligning policy models with human preferences has become increasingly critical. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for alignment, acting as an RL-free alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Despite DPO's various advancements and inherent limitations, an in-depth review of these aspects is currently lacking in the literature. In this work, we present a comprehensive review of the challenges and opportunities in DPO, covering theoretical analyses, variants, relevant preference datasets, and applications. Specifically, we categorize recent studies on DPO based on key research questions to provide a thorough understanding of DPO's current landscape. Additionally, we propose several future research directions to offer insights on model alignment for the research community. An updated collection of relevant papers can be found onthis https URL.

  Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST, outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human annotation.

  Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity, burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models, diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces an innovative Applicant Tracking System (ATS) enhanced by a novel Robotic process automation (RPA) framework or as further referred to as MLAR. Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models (LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education, experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and candidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR outperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation Anywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400 resumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume, reducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere and 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to transform recruitment workflows by providing an efficient, accurate, and scalable solution tailored to modern hiring needs.

  Online platforms struggle to curb hate speech without over-censoring legitimate discourse. Early bidirectional transformer encoders made big strides, but the arrival of ultra-large autoregressive LLMs promises deeper context-awareness. Whether this extra scale actually improves practical hate-speech detection on real-world text remains unverified. Our study puts this question to the test by benchmarking both model families, classic encoders and next-generation LLMs, on curated corpora of online interactions for hate-speech detection (Hate or No Hate).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications -- into a single common format providing the necessary information to experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase question frequency and relevancy.

  Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis, we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs. Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Metaphorical meaning is not a flat mapping between concepts, but a complex cognitive phenomenon that integrates multiple levels of interpretation. In this paper, we propose a stratified model of metaphor processing that treats meaning as an onion: a multi-layered structure comprising (1) content analysis, (2) conceptual blending, and (3) pragmatic intentionality. This three-dimensional framework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to metaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors are annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model conceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings. Finally, at the third level, we introduce a pragmatic vocabulary to capture speaker intent, communicative function, and contextual effects, aligning metaphor understanding with pragmatic theories. By unifying these layers into a single formal framework, our model lays the groundwork for computational methods capable of representing metaphorical meaning beyond surface associations, toward deeper, more context-sensitive reasoning.

  This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs. While LLMs like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI. Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative collaborators in linguistic inquiry.

  Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models (S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4) robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to 8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial defense. Codes are available atthis https URL

  Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic, dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase, local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches, PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.

  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects. \texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage, Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs, including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.

  Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular are promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large language models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification, instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance gain over the linear projection baseline.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In this work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However, directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical representations. These representations either integrate significant information from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework, dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT methods.

  _Simon M√ºnker_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs) fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity. Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather than flattening the moral landscape.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations. GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Suicide is a critical global health issue that requires urgent attention. Even though prior work has revealed valuable insights into detecting current suicide risk on social media, little attention has been paid to developing models that can predict subsequent suicide risk over time, limiting their ability to capture rapid fluctuations in individuals' mental state transitions. In addition, existing work ignores protective factors that play a crucial role in suicide risk prediction, focusing predominantly on risk factors alone. Protective factors such as social support and coping strategies can mitigate suicide risk by moderating the impact of risk factors. Therefore, this study proposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly learning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on users' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware Dataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive annotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also introduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the varying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions, recognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established psychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language models across three datasets. In addition, the proposed Dynamic Factors Influence Learning provides interpretable weights, helping clinicians better understand suicidal patterns and enabling more targeted intervention strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders (OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small, bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

  _Hai Toan Nguyen, Tien Dat Nguyen, Viet Ha Nguyen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference, the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

  _Qinyuan Ye, Robin Jia, Xiang Ren_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3, 2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1 function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8 addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

  _Qi Feng, Yihong Liu, Hinrich Sch√ºtze_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Curriculum learning is a widely adopted training strategy in natural language processing (NLP), where models are exposed to examples organized by increasing difficulty to enhance learning efficiency and performance. However, most existing approaches rely on manually defined difficulty metrics -- such as text length -- which may not accurately reflect the model's own perspective. To overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive curriculum learning paradigm that prioritizes fine-tuning examples based on difficulty scores predicted by pre-trained language models (PLMs) themselves. Building on these scores, we explore various training strategies that differ in the ordering of examples for the fine-tuning: from easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, to mixed sampling. We evaluate our method on four natural language understanding (NLU) datasets covering both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Experimental results show that our approach leads to faster convergence and improved performance compared to standard random sampling.

  Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. \baturay{However, it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations related to semantic understanding. To investigate this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of hidden states in transformer-based LLMs, analyzing 11 decoder-only models across 6 scientific topics and 12 layers each. We find that high-level semantic information consistently lies in low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across distinct domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers and under prompts that trigger structured reasoning or alignment behaviors$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content is unchanged. This geometry enables simple yet effective causal interventions in hidden space; for example, reasoning patterns like chain-of-thought can be captured by a single vector direction. Together, these findings support the development of geometry-aware tools that operate directly on latent representations to detect and mitigate harmful or adversarial content, using methods such as transport-based defenses that leverage this separability. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this potential by training a simple MLP classifier as a lightweight latent-space guardrail, which detects adversarial and malicious prompts with high precision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models exhibit cultural biases and limited cross-cultural understanding capabilities, particularly when serving diverse global user populations. We propose MCEval, a novel multilingual evaluation framework that employs dynamic cultural question construction and enables causal analysis through Counterfactual Rephrasing and Confounder Rephrasing. Our comprehensive evaluation spans 13 cultures and 13 languages, systematically assessing both cultural awareness and cultural bias across different linguistic scenarios. The framework provides 39,897 cultural awareness instances and 17,940 cultural bias instances. Experimental results reveal performance disparities across different linguistic scenarios, demonstrating that optimal cultural performance is not only linked to training data distribution, but also is related to language-culture alignment. The evaluation results also expose the fairness issue, where approaches appearing successful in the English scenario create substantial disadvantages. MCEval represents the first comprehensive multilingual cultural evaluation framework that provides deeper insights into LLMs' cultural understanding.

  The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems' performance on Thai legal question answering is still limited, especially for questions requiring extensive, complex legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce an approach aligning LLMs toward improved law citation accuracy and better response quality using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach leverages BGE-M3 embeddings as a cost-efficient semantic-similarity reward, significantly reducing computational expenses up to 2.5x compared to large language model judges. Experiments on the NitiBench benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements: GRPO achieves up to 90% citation-F1 gains from the base model and a 31% increase in joint quality metrics over instruction tuning. Crucially, our method shows enhanced robustness on complex legal reasoning tasks compared to instruction tuning, providing an effective and resource-efficient solution for enhancing Thai legal LLMs.

  While Knowledge Editing (KE) has been widely explored in English, its behavior in morphologically rich languages like Arabic remains underexamined. In this work, we present the first study of Arabic KE. We evaluate four methods (ROME, MEMIT, ICE, and LTE) on Arabic translations of the ZsRE and Counterfact benchmarks, analyzing both multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our experiments on Llama-2-7B-chat show show that parameter-based methods struggle with cross-lingual generalization, while instruction-tuned methods perform more robustly. We extend Learning-To-Edit (LTE) to a multilingual setting and show that joint Arabic-English training improves both editability and transfer. We release Arabic KE benchmarks and multilingual training for LTE data to support future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SpreadPy as a Python library for simulating spreading activation in cognitive single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tool is designed to perform numerical simulations testing structure-function relationships in cognitive processes. By comparing simulation results with grounded theories in knowledge modelling, SpreadPy enables systematic investigations of how activation dynamics reflect cognitive, psychological and clinical phenomena. We demonstrate the library's utility through three case studies: (1) Spreading activation on associative knowledge networks distinguishes students with high versus low math anxiety, revealing anxiety-related structural differences in conceptual organization; (2) Simulations of a creativity task show that activation trajectories vary with task difficulty, exposing how cognitive load modulates lexical access; (3) In individuals with aphasia, simulated activation patterns on lexical networks correlate with empirical error types (semantic vs. phonological) during picture-naming tasks, linking network structure to clinical impairments. SpreadPy's flexible framework allows researchers to model these processes using empirically derived or theoretical networks, providing mechanistic insights into individual differences and cognitive impairments. The library is openly available, supporting reproducible research in psychology, neuroscience, and education research.

In this work, we focus on adapting existing models to Belarusian, for which we propose a novel dataset of 43,150 definitions. Our experiments demonstrate that adapting a definition modeling systems requires minimal amounts of data, but that there currently are gaps in what automatic metrics do capture.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently, with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

  Long-context language models (LCLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in long-context understanding tasks. Among these, long-context referencing -- a crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific parts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models (Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several key insights. Our data and code can be found in https://github. com/wujunjie1998/Ref-Long.

  Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities, limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces, enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue, long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric.

  This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100 for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained joeranbosma/dragon-longformer-base-mixed-domain model included hyperparameter tuning, domain-specific preprocessing, and architectural adjustments. Key modifications involved increasing sequence length from 512 to 1024 tokens, adjusting learning rates from 1e-05 to 5e-06, extending training epochs from 5 to 8, and incorporating specialized medical terminology. The optimized model achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%, precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from 71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in healthcare settings.

  Data attribution methods quantify the influence of training data on model outputs and are becoming increasingly relevant for a wide range of LLM research and applications, including dataset curation, model interpretability, data valuation. However, there remain critical gaps in systematic LLM-centric evaluation of data attribution methods. To this end, we introduce DATE-LM (Data Attribution Evaluation in Language Models), a unified benchmark for evaluating data attribution methods through real-world LLM applications. DATE-LM measures attribution quality through three key tasks -- training data selection, toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. Our benchmark is designed for ease of use, enabling researchers to configure and run large-scale evaluations across diverse tasks and LLM architectures. Furthermore, we use DATE-LM to conduct a large-scale evaluation of existing data attribution methods. Our findings show that no single method dominates across all tasks, data attribution methods have trade-offs with simpler baselines, and method performance is sensitive to task-specific evaluation design. Finally, we release a public leaderboard for quick comparison of methods and to facilitate community engagement. We hope DATE-LM serves as a foundation for future data attribution research in LLMs.

  Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures, fostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models still struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through linguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper, we propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that utilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought process, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous texts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the humorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments on open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\% in humour, 2.81\% in fluency, and 6.13\% in coherence of the generated text.

  Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual base model into Banzhida, a multilingual large language model that advances generative AI for Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model, we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with existing public benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often develop learned mechanisms specialized to specific datasets, such as reliance on domain-specific correlations, which yield high-confidence predictions without generalizable reasoning. While beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid proliferation of multimodal misinformation presents significant challenges for automated fact-checking systems, especially when claims are ambiguous or lack sufficient context. We introduce RAMA, a novel retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries; (2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification, paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  _Bhavinkumar Vinodbhai Kuwar, Bikrant Bikram Pratap Maurya, Priyanshu Gupta, Nitin Choudhury_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is a complex and high-stakes task due to the subtlety of language and extreme class imbalance between deceptive and truthful communications. In this work, we revisit deception detection in the Diplomacy dataset, where less than 5% of messages are labeled deceptive. We introduce a lightweight yet effective model combining frozen BERT embeddings, interpretable linguistic and game-specific features, and a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning objective. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, PU-Lie is tailored for situations where only a small portion of deceptive messages are labeled, and the majority are unlabeled. Our model achieves a new best macro F1 of 0.60 while reducing trainable parameters by over 650x. Through comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies across seven models, we demonstrate the value of PU learning, linguistic interpretability, and speaker-aware representations. Notably, we emphasize that in this problem setting, accurately detecting deception is more critical than identifying truthful messages. This priority guides our choice of PU learning, which explicitly models the rare but vital deceptive class.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact, domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217 expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models, including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN, under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries, particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven, multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation standards.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique. However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale, high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids. However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key features of our system include robust configuration management, structured output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable, responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

  _Chien Van Nguyen, Ruiyi Zhang, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Puneet Mathur, Viet Dac Lai, Haoliang Wang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase, due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value (KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory, forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant improvements on associative recall tasks.

  Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) are a critical medium through which patient stigmatization is perpetuated among healthcare teams. Methods: We identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16), patients with Medicare/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46), self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25), with similar patterns of doubt markers. Discussion: Stigmatizing language occurred at higher rates among historically stigmatized patients, perpetuated by multiple provider types.

  Model steering represents a powerful technique that dynamically aligns large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during inference. However, conventional model-steering methods rely heavily on externally annotated data, not only limiting their adaptability to varying contexts but also tethering their effectiveness to annotation quality. In this paper, we present SIMS, the first self-improving model-steering framework that operates without relying on external supervision. At its core, SIMS autonomously generates and refines contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, enabling adaptive, context-specific steering. Additionally, SIMS employs novel strategies, including prompt ranking and contrast sampling, to further enhance steering efficacy. Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks demonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

  Objectives: To evaluate the current limitations of large language models (LLMs) in medical question answering, focusing on the quality of datasets used for their evaluation. Materials and Methods: Widely-used benchmark datasets, including MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU, were reviewed for their rigor, transparency, and relevance to clinical scenarios. Alternatives, such as challenge questions in medical journals, were also analyzed to identify their potential as unbiased evaluation tools. Results: Most existing datasets lack clinical realism, transparency, and robust validation processes. Publicly available challenge questions offer some benefits but are limited by their small size, narrow scope, and exposure to LLM training. These gaps highlight the need for secure, comprehensive, and representative datasets. Conclusion: A standardized framework is critical for evaluating LLMs in medicine. Collaborative efforts among institutions and policymakers are needed to ensure datasets and methodologies are rigorous, unbiased, and reflective of clinical complexities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''), they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over 260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases. We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and 18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents is essential for business workflows such as auditing, data analytics, and automated invoice processing. In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based model augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract tabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the extraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head, classifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description, Quantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices; (3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model is pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial document dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on each classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens using B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value pairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages both textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value extraction in real-world financial documents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68 publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1) reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

  The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks. Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these models rely solely on superficial statistics. We offer an accessible synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI while integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception of understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model forms "features" as directions in latent space, learning the connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second, state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world. Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" connecting these facts. However, these forms of understanding remain radically different from human understanding, as the phenomenon of "parallel mechanisms" shows. We conclude that the debate should move beyond the yes-or-no question of whether LLMs understand to investigate how their strange minds work and forge conceptions that fit them.

  LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive, multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks. Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini. These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual reasoning.

  _Cooper Doyle_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete diffusion language models learn to reconstruct text from randomly masked inputs, yet under mild assumptions their denoiser already implements the exact Bayesian posterior over the original tokens. We prove that the expected denoiser output under the forward corruption distribution recovers the true posterior, and that a simple Monte Carlo estimator converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)) with finite-sample concentration bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce an inference-time ensemble that runs K independent denoising passes and aggregates both posterior means and variances without any extra training. On WikiText-2, our MC-marginal sampler recovers the analytic lambda-DCE zero-shot perplexity (approximately 39) to within a few points at K=128, and its per-token variance shows a strong rank correlation with reconstruction error (Spearman rho = 0.996). This cost-proportional procedure yields calibrated uncertainty estimates and a direct trade-off between compute and posterior fidelity in discrete diffusion LMs.

  Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17 benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

  _Itay Itzhak, Yonatan Belinkov, Gabriel Stanovsky_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans. Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$ cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1) distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference, where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active) on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by 10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting fine-grained control of data access during inference.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation, external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages visually grounded reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In an era of rampant misinformation, generating reliable news explanations is vital, especially for under-represented languages like Hindi. Lacking robust automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation generation to low-resource languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View (CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6 diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source, proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase (this https URL), 2) MedVAL-Bench (this https URL), and 3) MedVAL-4B (this https URL), the best-performing open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching expert-level validation ability for medical text.

  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for evaluation frameworks that address the requirements of linguistically diverse regions, such as India, and go beyond English-centric benchmarks. We introduce EKA-EVAL, a unified evaluation framework that integrates over 35+ benchmarks (including 10 Indic benchmarks) across nine major evaluation categories. The framework provides broader coverage than existing Indian language evaluation tools, offering 11 core capabilities through a modular architecture, seamless integration with Hugging Face and proprietary models, and plug-and-play usability. As the first end-to-end suite for scalable, multilingual LLM benchmarking, the framework combines extensive benchmarks, modular workflows, and dedicated support for low-resource Indian languages to enable inclusive assessment of LLM capabilities across diverse domains. We conducted extensive comparisons against five existing baselines, demonstrating that EKA-EVAL achieves the highest participant ratings in four out of five categories. The framework is open-source and publicly available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles. Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM) output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space, dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection, tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios. Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model capabilities critical to ICL success.

  _Miles Turpin, Andy Arditi, Marvin Li, Joe Benton, Julian Michael_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models trained with reinforcement learning (RL) can engage in reward hacking--the exploitation of unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their chain-of-thought reasoning. This makes the detection of reward hacking difficult, posing risks for high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL fine-tuning intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to exploit these cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%; with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the influence of cues, from 8% to 43% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL. Baselines remain low even after RL (11% and 1%). Our results show that teaching models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and safe AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables, databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap, presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted onthis http URLand the framework onthis http URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and safety.

  Radiology reports are critical for clinical decision-making but often lack a standardized format, limiting both human interpretability and machine learning (ML) applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%, GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

  The development of high-performing, robust, and reliable speech technologies depends on large, high-quality datasets. However, African languages -- including our focus, Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba -- remain under-represented due to insufficient data. Popular voice-enabled technologies do not support any of the 2000+ African languages, limiting accessibility for circa one billion people. While previous dataset efforts exist for the target languages, they lack the scale and diversity needed for robust speech models. To bridge this gap, we introduce the NaijaVoices dataset, a 1,800-hour speech-text dataset with 5,000+ speakers. We outline our unique data collection approach, analyze its acoustic diversity, and demonstrate its impact through finetuning experiments on automatic speech recognition, averagely achieving 75.86% (Whisper), 52.06% (MMS), and 42.33% (XLSR) WER improvements. These results highlight NaijaVoices' potential to advance multilingual speech processing for African languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility, due to the lack of factual knowledge, their application to Question Answering (QA) tasks remains hindered by hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by integrating external knowledge, existing approaches rely heavily on in-context learning, whose performance is constrained by the fundamental reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we propose Mujica, a Multi-hop Joint Intelligence for Complex Question Answering, comprising a planner that decomposes questions into a directed acyclic graph of subquestions and a worker that resolves questions via retrieval and reasoning. Additionally, we introduce MyGO (Minimalist policy Gradient Optimization), a novel reinforcement learning method that replaces traditional policy gradient updates with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) by sampling trajectories from an asymptotically optimal policy. MyGO eliminates the need for gradient rescaling and reference models, ensuring stable and efficient training. Empirical results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Mujica-MyGO in enhancing multi-hop QA performance for various LLMs, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for complex QA tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

  Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. We introduce LEXam, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Adopting an LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. Project page:this https URL

  _Enes √ñzeren, Yihong Liu, Hinrich Sch√ºtze_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many pre-trained language models (PLMs) exhibit suboptimal performance on mid- and low-resource languages, largely due to limited exposure to these languages during pre-training. A common strategy to address this is to introduce new tokens specific to the target languages, initialize their embeddings, and apply continual pre-training on target-language data. Among such methods, OFA (Liu et al., 2024a) proposes a similarity-based subword embedding initialization heuristic that is both effective and efficient. However, OFA restricts target-language token embeddings to be convex combinations of a fixed number of source-language embeddings, which may limit expressiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose HYPEROFA, a hypernetwork-based approach for more adaptive token embedding initialization. The hypernetwork is trained to map from an external multilingual word vector space to the PLMs token embedding space using source-language tokens. Once trained, it can generate flexible embeddings for target-language tokens, serving as a good starting point for continual pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that HYPEROFA consistently outperforms random initialization baseline and matches or exceeds the performance of OFA in both continual pre-training convergence and downstream task performance. We make the code publicly available.

  Social bias in language models can potentially exacerbate social inequalities. Despite it having garnered wide attention, most research focuses on English data. In a low-resource scenario, the models often perform worse due to insufficient training data. This study aims to leverage high-resource language corpora to evaluate bias and experiment with debiasing methods in low-resource languages. We evaluated the performance of recent multilingual models in five languages: English, Chinese, Russian, Indonesian and Thai, and analyzed four bias dimensions: gender, religion, nationality, and race-color. By constructing multilingual bias evaluation datasets, this study allows fair comparisons between models across languages. We have further investigated three debiasing methods-CDA, Dropout, SenDeb-and demonstrated that debiasing methods from high-resource languages can be effectively transferred to low-resource ones, providing actionable insights for fairness research in multilingual NLP.

  Tool-Augmented Larage Language Models (TA-LLMs) have shown promise in real-world applications, but face challenges in handling incomplete queries and out-of-scope requests. While existing approaches rely mainly on Supervised Fine-Tuning with expert trajectories, we propose DiaTool-DPO, a novel method that enhances TA-LLM's dialogue capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization. We model TA-LLM interactions as a Markov Decision Process with 5 distinct dialogue states and categorize user queries into 3 types based on their state transition trajectories. We automatically construct paired trajectory datasets of correct and incorrect dialogue flows and introduce a specialized objective loss for dialogue control. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that DiaTool-DPO approaches GPT-4o's performance (94.8% in information gathering, 91% in tool call rejection) with substantial improvements over baseline (44% and 9.6% respectively) while maintaining core functionality. Our approach opens new possibilities for developing TA-LLMs that can handle diverse real-world scenarios without requiring additional expert demonstrations or human labeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding and mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring reliable content generation. While previous research has primarily focused on "when" LLMs hallucinate, our work explains "why" and directly links model behaviour to the pre-training data that forms their prior knowledge. Specifically, we demonstrate that an asymmetry exists in the recognition of logically equivalent facts, which can be attributed to frequency discrepancies of entities appearing as subjects versus objects. Given that most pre-training datasets are inaccessible, we leverage the fully open-source OLMo series by indexing its Dolma dataset to estimate entity frequencies. Using relational facts (represented as triples) from Wikidata5M, we construct probing datasets to isolate this effect. Our experiments reveal that facts with a high-frequency subject and a low-frequency object are better recognised than their inverse, despite their logical equivalence. The pattern reverses in low-to-high frequency settings, and no statistically significant asymmetry emerges when both entities are high-frequency. These findings highlight the influential role of pre-training data in shaping model predictions and provide insights for inferring the characteristics of pre-training data in closed or partially closed LLMs.

  Recent advances in Large Language Models have led to remarkable achievements across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, making prompt engineering increasingly central to guiding model outputs. While manual methods can be effective, they typically rely on intuition and do not automatically refine prompts over time. In contrast, automatic prompt optimization employing heuristic-based search algorithms can systematically explore and improve prompts with minimal human oversight. This survey proposes a comprehensive taxonomy of these methods, categorizing them by where optimization occurs, what is optimized, what criteria drive the optimization, which operators generate new prompts, and which iterative search algorithms are applied. We further highlight specialized datasets and tools that support and accelerate automated prompt refinement. We conclude by discussing key open challenges pointing toward future opportunities for more robust and versatile LLM applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Handling ambiguity and underspecification is an important challenge in natural language interfaces, particularly for tasks like text-to-SQL semantic parsing. We propose a modular approach that resolves ambiguity using natural language interpretations before mapping these to logical forms (e.g., SQL queries). Although LLMs excel at parsing unambiguous utterances, they show strong biases for ambiguous ones, typically predicting only preferred interpretations. We constructively exploit this bias to generate an initial set of preferred disambiguations and then apply a specialized infilling model to identify and generate missing interpretations. To train the infilling model, we introduce an annotation method that uses SQL execution to validate different meanings. Our approach improves interpretation coverage and generalizes across datasets with different annotation styles, database structures, and ambiguity types.

  Large language models (LLMs) are known to have the potential to generate harmful content, posing risks to users. While significant progress has been made in developing taxonomies for LLM risks and safety evaluation prompts, most studies have focused on monolingual contexts, primarily in English. However, language- and region-specific risks in bilingual contexts are often overlooked, and core findings can diverge from those in monolingual settings. In this paper, we introduce Qorgau, a novel dataset specifically designed for safety evaluation in Kazakh and Russian, reflecting the unique bilingual context in Kazakhstan, where both Kazakh (a low-resource language) and Russian (a high-resource language) are spoken. Experiments with both multilingual and language-specific LLMs reveal notable differences in safety performance, emphasizing the need for tailored, region-specific datasets to ensure the responsible and safe deployment of LLMs in countries like Kazakhstan.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-hoc explanation methods for black-box models often struggle with faithfulness and human interpretability due to the lack of explainability in current neural architectures. Meanwhile, B-cos networks have been introduced to improve model explainability by proposing an architecture that removes bias terms and promotes input-weight alignment. Although B-cos networks have shown success in building explainable systems, their application has so far been limited to computer vision models and their associated training pipelines. In this work, we introduce B-cos LMs, i.e., B-cos language models (LMs) empowered for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our approach directly transforms pre-trained language models into B-cos LMs by combining B-cos conversion and task fine-tuning, improving efficiency compared to previous methods. Our automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate that B-cos LMs produce more faithful and human interpretable explanations than post-hoc methods, while maintaining task performance comparable to conventional fine-tuning. Our in-depth analysis explores how B-cos LMs differ from conventionally fine-tuned models in their learning processes and explanation patterns. Finally, we are also the first to explore the transformation of decoder-only models to B-cos LMs for generation tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in decision-making and reasoning, particularly when integrated with various tools to effectively solve complex problems. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' tool usage face several limitations: (1) limited evaluation scenarios, often lacking assessments in real multi-turn dialogue contexts; (2) narrow evaluation dimensions, with insufficient detailed assessments of how LLMs use tools; and (3) reliance on LLMs or real API executions for evaluation, which introduces significant overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce ACEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing tool usage in LLMs. ACEBench categorizes data into three primary types based on evaluation methodology: Normal, Special, and Agent. "Normal" evaluates tool usage in basic scenarios; "Special" evaluates tool usage in situations with ambiguous or incomplete instructions; "Agent" evaluates tool usage through multi-agent interactions to simulate real-world, multi-turn dialogues. We conducted extensive experiments using ACEBench, analyzing various LLMs in-depth and providing a more granular examination of error causes across different data types.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

  _Tianshi Zheng, Weihan Li, Jiaxin Bai, Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show remarkable potential as question answering tools in the K-12 Education domain, where knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative textbooks. However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various vision-language tasks. However, it is still unclear how accurately LVLMs can perceive visual information in images. In particular, the capability of LVLMs to perceive geometric information, such as shape, angle, and size, remains insufficiently analyzed, although the perception of these properties is crucial for tasks that require a detailed visual understanding. In this work, we introduce VisOnlyQA, a dataset for evaluating the geometric perception of LVLMs, and reveal that LVLMs often cannot accurately perceive basic geometric information in images, while human performance is nearly perfect. VisOnlyQA consists of 12 tasks that directly ask about geometric information in geometric shapes, charts, chemical structures, and 3D shapes. Our experiments highlight the following findings: (i) State-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with basic geometric perception. 23 LVLMs we evaluate, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro, work poorly on VisOnlyQA. (ii) Additional training data does not resolve this issue. Fine-tuning on the training set of VisOnlyQA is not always effective, even for in-distribution tasks. (iii) LLM may be the bottleneck. LVLMs using stronger LLMs exhibit better geometric perception on VisOnlyQA, while it does not require complex reasoning, suggesting that the way LVLMs process information from visual encoders is a bottleneck.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding space, enabling it to be naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.

  This study investigates the linguistic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) regarding signifier (form) and signified (meaning) by distinguishing two LLM assessment paradigms: psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic. Traditional psycholinguistic evaluations often reflect statistical rules that may not accurately represent LLMs' true linguistic competence. We introduce a neurolinguistic approach, utilizing a novel method that combines minimal pair and diagnostic probing to analyze activation patterns across model layers. This method allows for a detailed examination of how LLMs represent form and meaning, and whether these representations are consistent across languages. We found: (1) Psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic methods reveal that language performance and competence are distinct; (2) Direct probability measurement may not accurately assess linguistic competence; (3) Instruction tuning won't change much competence but improve performance; (4) LLMs exhibit higher competence and performance in form compared to meaning. Additionally, we introduce new conceptual minimal pair datasets for Chinese (COMPS-ZH) and German (COMPS-DE), complementing existing English datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently become increasingly important with a wide range of applications. Despite the importance and recent progress, most existing works on personalized LLMs have focused either entirely on (a) personalized text generation or (b) leveraging LLMs for personalization-related downstream applications, such as recommendation systems. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two separate main directions for the first time by introducing a taxonomy for personalized LLM usage and summarizing the key differences and challenges. We provide a formalization of the foundations of personalized LLMs that consolidates and expands notions of personalization of LLMs, defining and discussing novel facets of personalization, usage, and desiderata of personalized LLMs. We then unify the literature across these diverse fields and usage scenarios by proposing systematic taxonomies for the granularity of personalization, personalization techniques, datasets, evaluation methods, and applications of personalized LLMs. Finally, we highlight challenges and important open problems that remain to be addressed. By unifying and surveying recent research using the proposed taxonomies, we aim to provide a clear guide to the existing literature and different facets of personalization in LLMs, empowering both researchers and practitioners.

  Attributing answers to source documents is an approach used to enhance the verifiability of a model's output in retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Prior work has mainly focused on improving and evaluating the attribution quality of large language models (LLMs) in RAG, but this may come at the expense of inducing biases in the attribution of answers. We define and examine two aspects in the evaluation of LLMs in RAG pipelines, namely attribution sensitivity and bias with respect to authorship information. We explicitly inform an LLM about the authors of source documents, instruct it to attribute its answers, and analyze (i) how sensitive the LLM's output is to the author of source documents, and (ii) whether the LLM exhibits a bias towards human-written or AI-generated source documents. We design an experimental setup in which we use counterfactual evaluation to study three LLMs in terms of their attribution sensitivity and bias in RAG pipelines. Our results show that adding authorship information to source documents can significantly change the attribution quality of LLMs by 3% to 18%. Moreover, we show that LLMs can have an attribution bias towards explicit human authorship, which can serve as a competing hypothesis for findings of prior work that shows that LLM-generated content may be preferred over human-written contents. Our findings indicate that metadata of source documents can influence LLMs' trust, and how they attribute their answers. Furthermore, our research highlights attribution bias and sensitivity as a novel aspect of brittleness in LLMs.

  Document Structured Extraction (DSE) aims to extract structured content from raw documents. Despite the emergence of numerous DSE systems, their unified evaluation remains inadequate, significantly hindering the field's advancement. This problem is largely attributed to existing benchmark paradigms, which exhibit fragmented and localized characteristics. To address these limitations and offer a thorough evaluation of DSE systems, we introduce a novel benchmark named READoc, which defines DSE as a realistic task of converting unstructured PDFs into semantically rich Markdown. The READoc dataset is derived from 3,576 diverse and real-world documents from arXiv, GitHub, and Zenodo. In addition, we develop a DSE Evaluation S$^3$uite comprising Standardization, Segmentation and Scoring modules, to conduct a unified evaluation of state-of-the-art DSE approaches. By evaluating a range of pipeline tools, expert visual models, and general VLMs, we identify the gap between current work and the unified, realistic DSE objective for the first time. We aspire that READoc will catalyze future research in DSE, fostering more comprehensive and practical solutions.

  How do vision-language (VL) transformer models ground verb phrases and do they integrate contextual and world knowledge in this process? We introduce the CV-Probes dataset, containing image-caption pairs involving verb phrases that require both social knowledge and visual context to interpret (e.g., "beg"), as well as pairs involving verb phrases that can be grounded based on information directly available in the image (e.g., "sit"). We show that VL models struggle to ground VPs that are strongly context-dependent. Further analysis using explainable AI techniques shows that such models may not pay sufficient attention to the verb token in the captions. Our results suggest a need for improved methodologies in VL model training and evaluation. The code and dataset will be availablethis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contemporary research in social sciences increasingly utilizes state-of-the-art generative language models to annotate or generate content. While these models achieve benchmark-leading performance on common language tasks, their application to novel out-of-domain tasks remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we investigate how personalized language models align with human responses on the Moral Foundation Theory Questionnaire. We adapt open-source generative language models to different political personas and repeatedly survey these models to generate synthetic data sets where model-persona combinations define our sub-populations. Our analysis reveals that models produce inconsistent results across multiple repetitions, yielding high response variance. Furthermore, the alignment between synthetic data and corresponding human data from psychological studies shows a weak correlation, with conservative persona-prompted models particularly failing to align with actual conservative populations. These results suggest that language models struggle to coherently represent ideologies through in-context prompting due to their alignment process. Thus, using language models to simulate social interactions requires measurable improvements in in-context optimization or parameter manipulation to align with psychological and sociological stereotypes properly.

  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Preference Optimization (PO) are key processes for aligning Language Models (LMs) with human preferences post pre-training. While SFT excels in efficiency and PO in effectiveness, they are often combined sequentially without integrating their optimization objectives. This approach ignores the opportunities to bridge their paradigm gap and take the strengths from both. In this paper, we interpret SFT and PO with two sub-processes -- Preference Estimation and Transition Optimization -- defined at token level within the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This modeling shows that SFT is only a special case of PO with inferior estimation and optimization. PO estimates the model's preference by its entire generation, while SFT only scores model's subsequent predicted tokens based on prior tokens from ground truth answer. These priors deviates from model's distribution, hindering the preference estimation and transition optimization. Building on this view, we introduce Intuitive Fine-Tuning (IFT) to integrate SFT and PO into a single process. Through a temporal residual connection, IFT brings better estimation and optimization by capturing LMs' intuitive sense of its entire answers. But it solely relies on a single policy and the same volume of non-preference-labeled data as SFT. Our experiments show that IFT performs comparably or even superiorly to SFT and some typical PO methods across several tasks, particularly those require generation, reasoning, and fact-following abilities. An explainable Frozen Lake game further validates the effectiveness of IFT for getting competitive policy.

  Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the state-of-the-art of many different natural language processing tasks. Although serving LLMs is computationally and memory demanding, the rise of Small Language Models (SLMs) offers new opportunities for resource-constrained users, who now are able to serve small models with cutting-edge performance. In this paper, we present a set of experiments designed to benchmark SLM inference at performance and energy levels. Our analysis provides a new perspective in serving, highlighting that the small memory footprint of SLMs allows for reaching the Pareto-optimal throughput within the resource capacity of a single accelerator. In this regard, we present an initial set of findings demonstrating how model replication can effectively improve resource utilization for serving SLMs.

  _Xuanxin Wu, Yuki Arase_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have used both automatic metrics and human evaluations to assess the simplification abilities of LLMs. However, the suitability of existing evaluation methodologies for LLMs remains in question. First, the suitability of current automatic metrics on LLMs' simplification evaluation is still uncertain. Second, current human evaluation approaches in sentence simplification often fall into two extremes: they are either too superficial, failing to offer a clear understanding of the models' performance, or overly detailed, making the annotation process complex and prone to inconsistency, which in turn affects the evaluation's reliability. To address these problems, this study provides in-depth insights into LLMs' performance while ensuring the reliability of the evaluation. We design an error-based human annotation framework to assess the LLMs' simplification capabilities. We select both closed-source and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama-3.2-3B. We believe that these models offer a representative selection across large, medium, and small sizes of LLMs. Results show that LLMs generally generate fewer erroneous simplification outputs compared to the previous state-of-the-art. However, LLMs have their limitations, as seen in GPT-4's and Qwen2.5-72B's struggle with lexical paraphrasing. Furthermore, we conduct meta-evaluations on widely used automatic metrics using our human annotations. We find that these metrics lack sufficient sensitivity to assess the overall high-quality simplifications, particularly those generated by high-performance LLMs.

  Designing optimal prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a complicated and resource-intensive task, often requiring substantial human expertise and effort. Existing approaches typically separate the optimization of prompt instructions and in-context learning examples, leading to incohesive prompts that are defined and represented by suboptimal task performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Cohesive In-Context Prompt Optimization framework that refines both prompt instructions and examples. However, formulating such an optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional space of natural language poses significant challenges in both convergence and computational efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce SEE, a scalable and efficient prompt optimization framework that adopts metaheuristic optimization principles and strategically balances exploration and exploitation to enhance optimization performance and achieve efficient convergence. SEE features a quad-phased design that alternates between global traversal (exploration) and local optimization (exploitation) and adaptively chooses LLM operators during the optimization process. We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation across 35 benchmark tasks, and SEE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin, achieving an average performance gain of 13.94 while reducing computational costs by 58.67.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent representation learning approaches enhance neural topic models by optimizing the weighted linear combination of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-likelihood and the contrastive learning objective that contrasts pairs of input documents. However, document-level contrastive learning might capture low-level mutual information, such as word ratio, which disturbs topic modeling. Moreover, there is a potential conflict between the ELBO loss that memorizes input details for better reconstruction quality, and the contrastive loss which attempts to learn topic representations that generalize among input documents. To address these issues, we first introduce a novel contrastive learning method oriented towards sets of topic vectors to capture useful semantics that are shared among a set of input documents. Secondly, we explicitly cast contrastive topic modeling as a gradient-based multi-objective optimization problem, with the goal of achieving a Pareto stationary solution that balances the trade-off between the ELBO and the contrastive objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently produces higher-performing neural topic models in terms of topic coherence, topic diversity, and downstream performance.

  In text classification, creating an adversarial example means subtly perturbing a few words in a sentence without changing its meaning, causing it to be misclassified by a classifier. A concerning observation is that a significant portion of adversarial examples generated by existing methods change only one word. This single-word perturbation vulnerability represents a significant weakness in classifiers, which malicious users can exploit to efficiently create a multitude of adversarial examples. This paper studies this problem and makes the following key contributions: (1) We introduce a novel metric $\rho$ to quantitatively assess a classifier's robustness against single-word perturbation. (2) We present the SP-Attack, designed to exploit the single-word perturbation vulnerability, achieving a higher attack success rate, better preserving sentence meaning, while reducing computation costs compared to state-of-the-art adversarial methods. (3) We propose SP-Defense, which aims to improve \r{ho} by applying data augmentation in learning. Experimental results on 4 datasets and BERT and distilBERT classifiers show that SP-Defense improves $\rho$ by 14.6% and 13.9% and decreases the attack success rate of SP-Attack by 30.4% and 21.2% on two classifiers respectively, and decreases the attack success rate of existing attack methods that involve multiple-word perturbations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples. The essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled data selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared with previous efforts on selective annotations, our influence-driven method works in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between data diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support. Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various benchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during subset selection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The syntactic structure of a sentence can be represented as a graph, where vertices are words and edges indicate syntactic dependencies between them. In this setting, the distance between two linked words is defined as the difference between their positions. Here we wish to contribute to the characterization of the actual distribution of syntactic dependency distances, which has previously been argued to follow a power-law distribution. Here we propose a new model with two exponential regimes in which the probability decay is allowed to change after a break-point. This transition could mirror the transition from the processing of word chunks to higher-level structures. We find that a two-regime model - where the first regime follows either an exponential or a power-law decay - is the most likely one in all 20 languages we considered, independently of sentence length and annotation style. Moreover, the break-point exhibits low variation across languages and averages values of 4-5 words, suggesting that the amount of words that can be simultaneously processed abstracts from the specific language to a high degree. The probability decay slows down after the breakpoint, consistently with a universal chunk-and-pass mechanism. Finally, we give an account of the relation between the best estimated model and the closeness of syntactic dependencies as function of sentence length, according to a recently introduced optimality score.

  Camera traps are revolutionising wildlife monitoring by capturing vast amounts of visual data; however, the manual identification of individual animals remains a significant bottleneck. This study introduces a fully self-supervised approach to learning robust chimpanzee face embeddings from unlabeled camera-trap footage. Leveraging the DINOv2 framework, we train Vision Transformers on automatically mined face crops, eliminating the need for identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework. The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation, object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below 20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

  Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present \textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches: ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours, whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering ~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union (IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16 ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial resolution (0.05¬∞) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations. Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their trade-offs.

  Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks, where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks, stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger model sizes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark, which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies. Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups. Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples), overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting, particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the paper is accepted.

  The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system (SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to 99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3% accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults, but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction, retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month) and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time, instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives, we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates compositional and text-based image retrieval.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems, mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated. Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance, showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3 oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality. CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development, with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However, obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose 4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters, enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential for large-scale applications. The code is released atthis https URL.

  With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI) technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search engines, social media, recommender systems, etc. The Devanagari script is one of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization tools. With the advancement of computing and technology, the task of this research is to extract handwritten Hindi characters from an image of Devanagari script with an automated approach to save time and obsolete data. In this paper, we present a technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters using two deep convolutional neural network layers. This work employs a methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character dataset (DHCD), an open dataset with 36 classes of Devanagari characters. Each of these classes has 1700 images for training and testing purposes. This approach obtains promising results in terms of accuracy by achieving 96.36% accuracy in testing and 99.55% in training time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving 99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45 dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon publication.

  Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations, yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical" views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes. Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts (contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to invariance.

  Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds, which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method outperforms existing ZSD models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also, it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so, we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

  Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the quality of the generated images across various datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment, we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

  Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo, a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy, human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM models are publicly available in the project page.

  Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained, identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process. This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips. Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation, showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video restoration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions, regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets, 1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55% on four remote sensing datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints. In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments. Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM, a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of 26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by 11.13%. Codes are available inthis https URL.

  Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis, due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait, to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset. We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models, demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for prosthesis-specific tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization (VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both one-step and few-step generation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images. However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity, clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL) framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed DGL.

  How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario. We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error, ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images, their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness.

  In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements. However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color, and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components, i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain, e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity. Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets, outperforming existing methodologies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA) point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography. Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated, semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in real-world applications.

  Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The source code is available atthis https URL.

In later frames, new tracklets are matched to existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and calibration for spatial validation.

  CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder, CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1) A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction. (3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with long-text input.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias across different model architectures.

  We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis, reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework. By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis, salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab. Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource agricultural settings.

  _Marc Serra Ortega, Emanuele Vivoli, Artemis Llabr√©s, Dimosthenis Karatzas_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces CoSMo, a novel multimodal Transformer for Page Stream Segmentation (PSS) in comic books, a critical task for automated content understanding, as it is a necessary first stage for many downstream tasks like character analysis, story indexing, or metadata enrichment. We formalize PSS for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo, developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS macro-structure, yet demonstrate multimodal benefits in resolving challenging ambiguities. CoSMo establishes a new state-of-the-art, paving the way for scalable comic book analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable, high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

  _Jaisidh Singh, Diganta Misra, Boris Knyazev, Antonio Orvieto_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by $10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

  _Tom Kouwenhoven, Kiana Shahrasbi, Tessa Verhoef_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba" with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human intuitions.

  _Geyou Zhang, Kai Liu, Ce Zhu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling. However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion. To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations. Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation (I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster motion error convergence.

  With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent, especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and rescue, and agricultural monitoring, where operations in complex environments can provide enhanced security. Current mainstream Anti-UAV tracking technologies are primarily centered around computer vision techniques, particularly those that integrate multi-sensor data fusion with advanced detection and tracking algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous driving.

  In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

  Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views. However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H√∂lder divergence, is proposed for multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H√∂lder divergence offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with theoretical guarantees.

  While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic, multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous, semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset DeepFashion-MultiModal (this https URL) to evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset, Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be released after acceptance.

  Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering, which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a new solution for graphic design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However, recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce. Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors. Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an exceptionally low parameter count.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA, which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention, which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released atthis https URL

  Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

  Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3% acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was limited to parsing fixed classes.

  Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in this domain, leveraging both Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-dependent and OCR-free frameworks to extract and interpret information in document images. This survey reviews recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1) methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2) training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets utilized for pretraining, instruction-tuning, and supervised fine-tuning. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and robustness of VRDU systems.

  Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition. We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2). Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories (with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

  _Amirhossein Ansari, Ke Wang, Pulei Xiong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information. Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases, compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial) approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance improvements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation (VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD). $L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

  _Phat Nguyen, Ngai-Man Cheung_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length, these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain. First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g., pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs. plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g., ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks for edge AI and AI agent applications.

  Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures, delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment instruction.

  WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints. To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric, outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset. Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a reliable and privacy-aware solution for continuous human motion analysis in indoor environments. Our codes are available inthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with: motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations, existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior. Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing previous approaches. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing (up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77% AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10% AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2 and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable healthcare solutions.

  Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework, particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies, enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks, while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and classification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining. Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

  Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding (DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on CPU devices.

  Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery, essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical surgical applications.

  Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.

  Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods, have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation. We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality, stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative possibilities for artists and designers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation (EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST) groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper, we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group. However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge. In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing, industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network (DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets. Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model weights will be made publicly available.

  Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr√∂dinger Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization, which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:this https URL.

  State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11% speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure, where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe, QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without compromising transferability.

  In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team, HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over 4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy, but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model, GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner. For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study, MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy. However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the \textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification and retrieval.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1) Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training. (2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual branches that learn local and global representations for individual and multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while significantly reducing the computational cost.

  The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work, we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

  Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging. These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline: image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing, normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions. Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a global scale.

  Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper, we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in 2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D, particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available atthis https URL

  Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder (DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained, category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating the necessity of each module.

  With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction scenarios. Project homepage:this https URL

  Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction, patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion framework. Our code, data, and models are released onthis https URLfor reproducibility.

  The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100, CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space. Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

  Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes. Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention (GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and low-texture surgical environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure, revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover, we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel. Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance. Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmark datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

  Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current State-of-the-Art methods.

  Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands, raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective, along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths, validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

  Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g. associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose \textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces \textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM), which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust emotion recognition in complex settings.

  Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However, most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset (PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes. Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering new insights into computational creativity and art education.

  An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted, which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as occlusions and distorted body proportions.There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views, and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs. Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves generalizability.Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a Stable Diffusion backbone.Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

  _Behraj Khan, Tahir Syed_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions, calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19 vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration with foundation models. Code and models will be released atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

  Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level, tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values. Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving, with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road, 3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm, which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue. Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be obtained atthis https URL).

  The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress, current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance (Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG, with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for clinical use.

  Wave propagation on the surface of a material contains information about physical properties beneath its surface. We propose a method for inferring the thickness and stiffness of a structure from just a video of waves on its surface. Our method works by extracting a dispersion relation from the video and then solving a physics-based optimization problem to find the best-fitting thickness and stiffness parameters. We validate our method on both simulated and real data, in both cases showing strong agreement with ground-truth measurements. Our technique provides a proof-of-concept for at-home health monitoring of medically-informative tissue properties, and it is further applicable to fields such as human-computer interaction.

  The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME) approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular, THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation. Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

  Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment. We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code can be accessed inthis https URL.

  Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks, revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding, we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental learning.

  Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models, yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation (SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt. Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution for text-guided editing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation, enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions. Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in language-guided pose estimation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours, accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences, facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model, MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen.

  Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models. Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring additional replay data. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it, we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming efficiency.

  Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point cloud self-supervised learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists' eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case), when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image analytics.

  _Ram S Iyer, Narayan S Iyer, Rugmini Ammal P_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem. Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture. Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

  Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques, from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods (e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models (e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated multi-image understanding benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions. Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and ImageNetLT.

  The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA) have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify, understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

  Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

  We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data. It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while preserving the alignment between image and textthis http URLexperiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:this https URL.

  The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake generators.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as "compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely, given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time, given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach, achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size, rendering quality, and rendering speed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization. Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To narrow this gap, we propose MGVQ, a novel method to augment the representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance of existing methods rigorously. MGVQ achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet and 8 zero-shot benchmarks across all VQ-VAEs. Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly, with rFID 0.49 v.s. 0.91, and achieve superior PSNR on all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of MGVQ in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD image processing tasks. Code will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans, for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

  Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic, audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image, predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while generalizing across speakers and contexts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations: inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2) Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks, offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension tasks. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  _Rushil Desai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through forests, where precise surface geometry and reliable uncertainty estimates are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) define continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify local surface instability using Hessian-based metrics, enabling efficient, surfaceaware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry, providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency, establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction, simulation, and robotic decision-making.

  Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets 56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust keypoint extractor.RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made our code publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes, moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and loss of details.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching. Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

  EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy. Beyond classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in real-world clinical settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Brain stroke is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, underscoring the need for precise and rapid prediction techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. Most stroke classification techniques use a single slice-level prediction mechanism, requiring radiologists to manually select the most critical CT slice from the original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques, this study investigates machine learning models for early brain stroke prediction using CT scan images. This research proposes a novel machine learning approach to brain stroke detection, focusing on optimizing classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are used for feature extraction. Feature engineering techniques, including BFO, PCA, and LDA, further enhance model performance. These features are then classified using machine learning algorithms, including SVC, RF, XGB, DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

  In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions. This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this domain.

  Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent privacy protection.

  Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to 68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in real-world scenarios.

  The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention. To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures, achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

  The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However, these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians, due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's practical utility.

  Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space. In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of image generative models to augment human creativity.

  Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base (86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1) Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2) Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example, with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects. Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

  Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history, economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation, reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

  Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue, law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations, we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS, which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs, ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our dataset and baseline method are publicly available onthis https URL.

  Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (\textbf{MV-AR}) method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the ``Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading diffusion-based multi-view image generation models.

  Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although commercial solutions exist, they typically require rigid workspace setups or the application of visual markers to simplify the problem. We introduce ViMAT, a novel AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks that operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative analysis in challenging real-world scenarios characterized by partial and uncertain visual observations.

  Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from 2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts, all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR), and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data, progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets. BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models, including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2- patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view. However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as 3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available atthis https URL.

  Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT) module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\% detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial 33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines.

- **[Holistic White-light Polyp Classification via Alignment-free Dense Distillation of Auxiliary Optical Chromoendoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19319)**  `arXiv:2505.19319`  
  _Qiang Hu, Qimei Wang, Jia Chen, Xuantao Ji, Mei Liu, Qiang Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main colonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical chromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common and often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However, WLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical applicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through global feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are susceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic cues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification framework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp localization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation (ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation regardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to explicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to establish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along the most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation reliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter cross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those semantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis. Extensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by at least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking Transformers offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning by transmitting information solely through binary (0/1) spikes. However, there remains a substantial performance gap compared to artificial neural networks. A common belief is that their binary and sparse activation transmission leads to information loss, thus degrading feature representation and accuracy. In this work, however, we reveal for the first time that spiking neurons preferentially propagate low-frequency information. We hypothesize that the rapid dissipation of high-frequency components is the primary cause of performance degradation. For example, on Cifar-100, adopting Avg-Pooling (low-pass) for token mixing lowers performance to 76.73%; interestingly, replacing it with Max-Pooling (high-pass) pushes the top-1 accuracy to 79.12%, surpassing the well-tuned Spikformer baseline by 0.97%. Accordingly, we introduce Max-Former that restores high-frequency signals through two frequency-enhancing operators: extra Max-Pooling in patch embedding and Depth-Wise Convolution in place of self-attention. Notably, our Max-Former (63.99 M) hits the top-1 accuracy of 82.39% on ImageNet, showing a +7.58% improvement over Spikformer with comparable model size (74.81%, 66.34 M). We hope this simple yet effective solution inspires future research to explore the distinctive nature of spiking neural networks, beyond the established practice in standard deep learning. \href{this https URL}{Code} is available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multispectral object detection aims to leverage complementary information from visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities to enable robust performance under diverse environmental conditions. Our key insight, derived from wavelet analysis and empirical observations, is that IR images contain structurally rich high-frequency information critical for object detection, making an infrared-centric approach highly effective. To capitalize on this finding, we propose Infrared-Centric Fusion (IC-Fusion), a lightweight and modality-aware sensor fusion method that prioritizes infrared features while effectively integrating complementary RGB semantic context. IC-Fusion adopts a compact RGB backbone and designs a novel fusion module comprising a Multi-Scale Feature Distillation (MSFD) block to enhance RGB features and a three-stage fusion block with a Cross-Modal Channel Shuffle Gate (CCSG), a Cross-Modal Large Kernel Gate (CLKG), and a Channel Shuffle Projection (CSP) to facilitate effective cross-modal interaction. Experiments on the FLIR and LLVIP benchmarks demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our IR-centric fusion strategy, further validating its benefits.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues. To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets: DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased detectors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  PAD and FFD are proposed to protect face data from physical media-based Presentation Attacks and digital editing-based DeepFakes, respectively. However, isolated training of these two models significantly increases vulnerability towards unknown attacks, burdening deployment environments. The lack of a Unified Face Attack Detection model to simultaneously handle attacks in these two categories is mainly attributed to two factors: (1) A benchmark that is sufficient for models to explore is lacking. Existing UAD datasets only contain limited attack types and samples, leading to the model's confined ability to address abundant advanced threats. In light of these, through an explainable hierarchical way, we propose the most extensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques available to date, namely UniAttackDataPlus. Our UniAttackData+ encompasses 2,875 identities and their 54 kinds of corresponding falsified samples, in a total of 697,347 videos. (2) The absence of a trustworthy classification criterion. Current methods endeavor to explore an arbitrary criterion within the same semantic space, which fails to exist when encountering diverse attacks. Thus, we present a novel Visual-Language Model-based Hierarchical Prompt Tuning Framework that adaptively explores multiple classification criteria from different semantic spaces. Specifically, we construct a VP-Tree to explore various classification rules hierarchically. Then, by adaptively pruning the prompts, the model can select the most suitable prompts guiding the encoder to extract discriminative features at different levels in a coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, to help the model understand the classification criteria in visual space, we propose a DPI module to project the visual prompts to the text encoder to help obtain a more accurate semantics.

  _Zheang Huai, Hui Tang, Yi Li, Zhuangzhuang Chen, Xiaomeng Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) for segmentation aims at adapting a model trained in the source domain to perform well in the target domain with only the source model and unlabeled target data. Inspired by the recent success of Segment Anything Model (SAM) which exhibits the generality of segmenting images of various modalities and in different domains given human-annotated prompts like bounding boxes or points, we for the first time explore the potentials of Segment Anything Model for SFDA via automatedly finding an accurate bounding box prompt. We find that the bounding boxes directly generated with existing SFDA approaches are defective due to the domain gap. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Dual Feature Guided (DFG) auto-prompting approach to search for the box prompt. Specifically, the source model is first trained in a feature aggregation phase, which not only preliminarily adapts the source model to the target domain but also builds a feature distribution well-prepared for box prompt search. In the second phase, based on two feature distribution observations, we gradually expand the box prompt with the guidance of the target model feature and the SAM feature to handle the class-wise clustered target features and the class-wise dispersed target features, respectively. To remove the potentially enlarged false positive regions caused by the over-confident prediction of the target model, the refined pseudo-labels produced by SAM are further postprocessed based on connectivity analysis. Experiments on 3D and 2D datasets indicate that our approach yields superior performance compared to conventional methods. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In low-light environments, the performance of computer vision algorithms often deteriorates significantly, adversely affecting key vision tasks such as segmentation, detection, and classification. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, its application to low-light image processing has attracted widespread attention and seen significant progress in recent years. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically examine how recent deep-learning-based low-light image enhancement methods function and evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing downstream vision tasks. To address this gap, this review provides detailed elaboration on how various recent approaches (from 2020) operate and their enhancement mechanisms, supplemented with clear illustrations. It also investigates the impact of different enhancement techniques on subsequent vision tasks, critically analyzing their strengths and limitations. Our review found that image enhancement improved the performance of downstream vision tasks to varying degrees. Although supervised methods often produced images with high perceptual quality, they typically produced modest improvements in vision tasks. In contrast, zero-shot learning, despite achieving lower scores in image quality metrics, showed consistently boosted performance across various vision tasks. These suggest a disconnect between image quality metrics and those evaluating vision task performance. Additionally, unsupervised domain adaptation techniques demonstrated significant gains in segmentation tasks, highlighting their potential in practical low-light scenarios where labelled data is scarce. Observed limitations of existing studies are analyzed, and directions for future research are proposed. This review serves as a useful reference for determining low-light image enhancement techniques and optimizing vision task performance in low-light conditions.

  _Bojin Wu, Jing Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular depth estimation can be broadly categorized into two directions: relative depth estimation, which predicts normalized or inverse depth without absolute scale, and metric depth estimation, which aims to recover depth with real-world scale. While relative methods are flexible and data-efficient, their lack of metric scale limits their utility in downstream tasks. A promising solution is to infer absolute scale from textual descriptions. However, such language-based recovery is highly sensitive to natural language ambiguity, as the same image may be described differently across perspectives and styles. To address this, we introduce VGLD (Visually-Guided Linguistic Disambiguation), a framework that incorporates high-level visual semantics to resolve ambiguity in textual inputs. By jointly encoding both image and text, VGLD predicts a set of global linear transformation parameters that align relative depth maps with metric scale. This visually grounded disambiguation improves the stability and accuracy of scale estimation. We evaluate VGLD on representative models, including MiDaS and DepthAnything, using standard indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) benchmarks. Results show that VGLD significantly mitigates scale estimation bias caused by inconsistent or ambiguous language, achieving robust and accurate metric predictions. Moreover, when trained on multiple datasets, VGLD functions as a universal and lightweight alignment module, maintaining strong performance even in zero-shot settings. Code will be released upon acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a method for Sparse view reconstruction with surface element splatting that runs within 3 minutes on a consumer grade GPU. While few methods address sparse radiance field learning from noisy or unposed sparse cameras, shape recovery remains relatively underexplored in this setting. Several radiance and shape learning test-time optimization methods address the sparse posed setting by learning data priors or using combinations of external monocular geometry priors. Differently, we propose an efficient and simple pipeline harnessing a single recent 3D foundation model. We leverage its various task heads, notably point maps and camera initializations to instantiate a bundle adjusting 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) model, and image correspondences to guide camera optimization midst 2DGS training. Key to our contribution is a novel formulation of splatted color variance along rays, which can be computed efficiently. Reducing this moment in training leads to more accurate shape reconstructions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performances in the sparse uncalibrated setting in reconstruction and novel view benchmarks based on established multi-view datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gait recognition enables contact-free, long-range person identification that is robust to clothing variations and non-cooperative scenarios. While existing methods perform well in controlled indoor environments, they struggle with cross-vertical view scenarios, where surveillance angles vary significantly in elevation. Our experiments show up to 60\% accuracy degradation in low-to-high vertical view settings due to severe deformations and self-occlusions of key anatomical features. Current CNN and self-attention-based methods fail to effectively handle these challenges, due to their reliance on single-scale convolutions or simplistic attention mechanisms that lack effective multi-frequency feature integration. To tackle this challenge, we propose CVVNet (Cross-Vertical-View Network), a frequency aggregation architecture specifically designed for robust cross-vertical-view gait recognition. CVVNet employs a High-Low Frequency Extraction module (HLFE) that adopts parallel multi-scale convolution/max-pooling path and self-attention path as high- and low-frequency mixers for effective multi-frequency feature extraction from input silhouettes. We also introduce the Dynamic Gated Aggregation (DGA) mechanism to adaptively adjust the fusion ratio of high- and low-frequency features. The integration of our core Multi-Scale Attention Gated Aggregation (MSAGA) module, HLFE and DGA enables CVVNet to effectively handle distortions from view changes, significantly improving the recognition robustness across different vertical views. Experimental results show that our CVVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with $8.6\%$ improvement on DroneGait and $2\%$ on Gait3D compared with the best existing methods.

  We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy. To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model.

  Collaborative perception enhances environmental awareness through inter-agent communication and is regarded as a promising solution to intelligent transportation systems. However, existing collaborative methods for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) overlook the unique characteristics of the UAV perspective, resulting in substantial communication overhead. To address this issue, we propose a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception framework based on late-intermediate fusion, dubbed LIF. The core concept is to exchange informative and compact detection results and shift the fusion stage to the feature representation level. In particular, we leverage vision-guided positional embedding (VPE) and box-based virtual augmented feature (BoBEV) to effectively integrate complementary information from various agents. Additionally, we innovatively introduce an uncertainty-driven communication mechanism that uses uncertainty evaluation to select high-quality and reliable shared areas. Experimental results demonstrate that our LIF achieves superior performance with minimal communication bandwidth, proving its effectiveness and practicality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models enhance neuroimaging through data augmentation, quality improvement, and rare condition studies. Despite advances in realistic synthetic MRIs, evaluations focus on texture and perception, lacking sensitivity to crucial anatomical fidelity. This study proposes a new metric, called WASABI (Wasserstein-Based Anatomical Brain Index), to assess the anatomical realism of synthetic brain MRIs. WASABI leverages \textit{SynthSeg}, a deep learning-based brain parcellation tool, to derive volumetric measures of brain regions in each MRI and uses the multivariate Wasserstein distance to compare distributions between real and synthetic anatomies. Based on controlled experiments on two real datasets and synthetic MRIs from five generative models, WASABI demonstrates higher sensitivity in quantifying anatomical discrepancies compared to traditional image-level metrics, even when synthetic images achieve near-perfect visual quality. Our findings advocate for shifting the evaluation paradigm beyond visual inspection and conventional metrics, emphasizing anatomical fidelity as a crucial benchmark for clinically meaningful brain MRI synthesis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point clouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network architectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SS-SS) aims to mitigate the heavy annotation burden of dense pixel labeling by leveraging abundant unlabeled images alongside a small labeled set. While current consistency regularization methods achieve strong results, they often overlook a critical challenge: the precise delineation of object boundaries. In this paper, we propose BoundMatch, a novel multi-task SS-SS framework that explicitly integrates semantic boundary detection into a teacher-student consistency regularization pipeline. Our core mechanism, Boundary Consistency Regularized Multi-Task Learning (BCRM), enforces prediction agreement between teacher and student models on both segmentation masks and detailed semantic boundaries. To further enhance performance and sharpen boundaries, BoundMatch incorporates two lightweight fusion modules: Boundary-Semantic Fusion (BSF) injects learned boundary cues into the segmentation decoder, while Spatial Gradient Fusion (SGF) refines boundary predictions using mask gradients, leading to higher-quality boundary pseudo-labels. This framework is built upon SAMTH, a strong teacher-student baseline featuring a Harmonious Batch Normalization (HBN) update strategy for improved stability. Extensive experiments on diverse urban-driving scene datasets including Cityscapes, BDD100K, and SYNTHIA show that BoundMatch achieves competitive performance against current state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the new benchmark with DINOv2 foundation model. We further validate our approach's generalizability on Pascal VOC and ADE20K datasets. Ablation studies highlight BoundMatch's ability to improve boundary-specific evaluation metrics, its effectiveness in realistic large-scale unlabeled data scenarios, and applicability to lightweight architectures for mobile deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stereo images are fundamental to numerous applications, including extended reality (XR) devices, autonomous driving, and robotics. Unfortunately, acquiring high-quality stereo images remains challenging due to the precise calibration requirements of dual-camera setups and the complexity of obtaining accurate, dense disparity maps. Existing stereo image generation methods typically focus on either visual quality for viewing or geometric accuracy for matching, but not both. We introduce GenStereo, a diffusion-based approach, to bridge this gap. The method includes two primary innovations (1) conditioning the diffusion process on a disparity-aware coordinate embedding and a warped input image, allowing for more precise stereo alignment than previous methods, and (2) an adaptive fusion mechanism that intelligently combines the diffusion-generated image with a warped image, improving both realism and disparity consistency. Through extensive training on 11 diverse stereo datasets, GenStereo demonstrates strong generalization ability. GenStereo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both stereo image generation and unsupervised stereo matching tasks. Project page is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Individual Counting (VIC) has received increasing attention for its importance in intelligent video surveillance. Existing works are limited in two aspects, i.e., dataset and method. Previous datasets are captured with fixed or rarely moving cameras with relatively sparse individuals, restricting evaluation for a highly varying view and time in crowded scenes. Existing methods rely on localization followed by association or classification, which struggle under dense and dynamic conditions due to inaccurate localization of small targets. To address these issues, we introduce the MovingDroneCrowd Dataset, featuring videos captured by fast-moving drones in crowded scenes under diverse illuminations, shooting heights and angles. We further propose a Shared Density map-guided Network (SDNet) using a Depth-wise Cross-Frame Attention (DCFA) module to directly estimate shared density maps between consecutive frames, from which the inflow and outflow density maps are derived by subtracting the shared density maps from the global density maps. The inflow density maps across frames are summed up to obtain the number of unique pedestrians in a video. Experiments on our datasets and publicly available ones show the superiority of our method over the state of the arts in highly dynamic and complex crowded scenes. Our dataset and codes have been released publicly.

  Existing MLLMs encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our method consists of four key steps: 1) Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2) Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos to improve the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3) Action: Agents answer long video questions and exchange reasons. 4) Reflection: We evaluate each agent's performance in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (like GPT-4o) and open-source models (like InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80\% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, LVAgent improves accuracy by 13.3\% on LongVideoBench. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial in maintaining performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) when facing distribution shifts, particularly when the source data or target labels are inaccessible. Existing TTA methods predominantly leverage the output probability distribution of CLIP for feature evaluation, resulting in biases under domain shifts, which cause misclassified features due to text priors or incorrect textual associations. To address these issues, we propose \underline{B}idirectional Prototype-Reward co-Evolution (BPRE), a novel VLMs framework with TTA that integrates feature quality assessment with prototype evolution via a synergistic feedback loop. First, the Multi-dimensional Quality-aware Reward Module (MQRM) is designed to evaluate feature quality and guide prototype refinement precisely. The continuous refinement of prototype quality via Prototype-Reward Interactive Evolution (PRIE) enhances the computation more robust. Through this bidirectional interaction, the precision of rewards and prototype evolution mutually reinforce each other, forming a self-evolving feedback cycle. Extensive experiments conducted on 15 diverse recognition datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves superior performance compared to other SOTA methods, and advances VLM generalization capabilities through emphasizing comprehensive feature evaluation.

  Image assessment aims to evaluate the quality and aesthetics of images and has been applied across various scenarios, such as natural and AIGC scenes. Existing methods mostly address these sub-tasks or scenes individually. While some works attempt to develop unified image assessment models, they have struggled to achieve satisfactory performance or cover a broad spectrum of assessment scenarios. In this paper, we present \textbf{Gamma}, a \textbf{G}eneric im\textbf{A}ge assess\textbf{M}ent model using \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{A}ssessment Experts, which can effectively assess images from diverse scenes through mixed-dataset training. Achieving unified training in image assessment presents significant challenges due to annotation biases across different datasets. To address this issue, we first propose a Mixture of Assessment Experts (MoAE) module, which employs shared and adaptive experts to dynamically learn common and specific knowledge for different datasets, respectively. In addition, we introduce a Scene-based Differential Prompt (SDP) strategy, which uses scene-specific prompts to provide prior knowledge and guidance during the learning process, further boosting adaptation for various scenes. Our Gamma model is trained and evaluated on 12 datasets spanning 6 image assessment scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our unified Gamma outperforms other state-of-the-art mixed-training methods by significant margins while covering more scenes. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  _Qiaole Dong, Yanwei Fu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense point tracking is a challenging task requiring the continuous tracking of every point in the initial frame throughout a substantial portion of a video, even in the presence of occlusions. Traditional methods use optical flow models to directly estimate long-range motion, but they often suffer from appearance drifting without considering temporal consistency. Recent point tracking algorithms usually depend on sliding windows for indirect information propagation from the first frame to the current one, which is slow and less effective for long-range tracking. To account for temporal consistency and enable efficient information propagation, we present a lightweight and fast model with \textbf{S}treaming memory for dense \textbf{PO}int \textbf{T}racking and online video processing. The \textbf{SPOT} framework features three core components: a customized memory reading module for feature enhancement, a sensory memory for short-term motion dynamics modeling, and a visibility-guided splatting module for accurate information propagation. This combination enables SPOT to perform dense point tracking with state-of-the-art accuracy on the CVO benchmark, as well as comparable or superior performance to offline models on sparse tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP. Notably, SPOT with 10$\times$ smaller parameter numbers operates at least 2$\times$ faster than previous state-of-the-art models while maintaining the best performance on CVO. We will release the models and codes at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention due to its high-quality novel view rendering, motivating research to address real-world challenges. A critical issue is the camera motion blur caused by movement during exposure, which hinders accurate 3D scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose CoMoGaussian, a Continuous Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting that reconstructs precise 3D scenes from motion-blurred images while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Considering the complex motion patterns inherent in real-world camera movements, we predict continuous camera trajectories using neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To ensure accurate modeling, we employ rigid body transformations, preserving the shape and size of the object but rely on the discrete integration of sampled frames. To better approximate the continuous nature of motion blur, we introduce a continuous motion refinement (CMR) transformation that refines rigid transformations by incorporating additional learnable parameters. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and leveraging advanced neural ODE techniques, we achieve precise modeling of continuous camera trajectories, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets, which include a wide range of motion blur scenarios, from moderate to extreme blur.

  _Miao Zhang, Sherif Abdulatif, Benedikt Loesch, Marco Altmann, Bin Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to the significant effort required for data collection and annotation in 3D perception tasks, mixed sample data augmentation (MSDA) has been widely studied to generate diverse training samples by mixing existing data. Recently, many MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly target LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA methods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these techniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular distribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar setups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware PillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar level in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a single mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to each pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different classes, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large vehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse objects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This class-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new information, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance but also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street and K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will spark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Registration of diffusion MRI tractography is an essential step for analyzing group similarities and variations in the brain's white matter (WM). Streamline-based registration approaches can leverage the 3D geometric information of fiber pathways to enable spatial alignment after registration. Existing methods usually rely on the optimization of the spatial distances to identify the optimal transformation. However, such methods overlook point connectivity patterns within the streamline itself, limiting their ability to identify anatomical correspondences across tractography datasets. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised approach using deep learning to perform streamline-based dMRI tractography registration. The overall idea is to identify corresponding keypoint pairs across subjects for spatial alignment of tractography datasets. We model tractography as point clouds to leverage the graph connectivity along streamlines. We propose a novel keypoint detection method for streamlines, framed as a probabilistic classification task to identify anatomically consistent correspondences across unstructured streamline sets. In the experiments, we compare several existing methods and show highly effective and efficient tractography registration performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant progress in diffusion-based image generation, subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing remain challenging. Existing methods typically treat them separately, struggling with limited high-quality data and poor generalization. However, both tasks require capturing complex visual variations while maintaining consistency between inputs and outputs. Inspired by this, we propose MIGE, a unified framework that standardizes task representations using multimodal instructions. It first treats subject-driven generation as creation on a blank canvas and instruction-based editing as modification of an existing image, establishing a shared input-output formulation, then introduces a novel multimodal encoder that maps free-form multimodal instructions into a unified vision-language space, integrating visual and semantic features through a feature fusion mechanism. This unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two key advantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: by leveraging shared visual and semantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and visual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing. (2) Generalization: learning in a unified format facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer, enabling MIGE to generalize to novel compositional tasks, including instruction-based subject-driven editing. Experiments show that MIGE excels in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing while setting a SOTA in the new task of instruction-based subject-driven editing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-based occupancy networks (VONs) provide an end-to-end solution for reconstructing 3D environments in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistencies, manifesting as flickering effects that compromise visual experience and adversely affect decision-making. While recent approaches have incorporated historical data to mitigate the issue, they often incur high computational costs and may introduce noisy information that interferes with object detection. We propose OccLinker, a novel plugin framework designed to seamlessly integrate with existing VONs for boosting performance. Our method efficiently consolidates historical static and motion cues, learns sparse latent correlations with current features through a dual cross-attention mechanism, and produces correction occupancy components to refine the base network's predictions. We propose a new temporal consistency metric to quantitatively identify flickering effects. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior performance with negligible computational overhead, while effectively eliminating flickering artifacts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A small but growing body of work has shown that machine learning models which better align with human vision have also exhibited higher robustness to adversarial examples, raising the question: can human-like perception make models more secure? If true generally, such mechanisms would offer new avenues toward robustness. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis to systematically investigate the relationship between representational alignment and adversarial robustness. We evaluate 114 models spanning diverse architectures and training paradigms, measuring their neural and behavioral alignment and engineering task performance across 105 benchmarks as well as their adversarial robustness via AutoAttack. Our findings reveal that while average alignment and robustness exhibit a weak overall correlation, specific alignment benchmarks serve as strong predictors of adversarial robustness, particularly those that measure selectivity toward texture or shape. These results suggest that different forms of alignment play distinct roles in model robustness, motivating further investigation into how alignment-driven approaches can be leveraged to build more secure and perceptually-grounded vision models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in camera-trajectory-guided image-to-video generation offer higher precision and better support for complex camera control compared to text-based approaches. However, they also introduce significant usability challenges, as users often struggle to provide precise camera parameters when working with arbitrary real-world images without knowledge of their depth nor scene scale. To address these real-world application issues, we propose RealCam-I2V, a novel diffusion-based video generation framework that integrates monocular metric depth estimation to establish 3D scene reconstruction in a preprocessing step. During training, the reconstructed 3D scene enables scaling camera parameters from relative to metric scales, ensuring compatibility and scale consistency across diverse real-world images. In inference, RealCam-I2V offers an intuitive interface where users can precisely draw camera trajectories by dragging within the 3D scene. To further enhance precise camera control and scene consistency, we propose scene-constrained noise shaping, which shapes high-level noise and also allows the framework to maintain dynamic and coherent video generation in lower noise stages. RealCam-I2V achieves significant improvements in controllability and video quality on the RealEstate10K and out-of-domain images. We further enables applications like camera-controlled looping video generation and generative frame interpolation. Project page:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image restoration tasks. However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code is released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing availability of longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets has facilitated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modeling of disease progression, making it possible to predict future medical scans for individual patients. However, despite significant advancements in AI, current methods continue to face challenges including achieving patient-specific individualization, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency, efficiently utilizing longitudinal data, and managing the substantial memory demands of 3D scans. To address these challenges, we propose Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel spatiotemporal model designed to predict individual-level disease progression in 3D brain MRIs. The key contributions in BrLP are fourfold: (i) it operates in a small latent space, mitigating the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional imaging data; (ii) it explicitly integrates subject metadata to enhance the individualization of predictions; (iii) it incorporates prior knowledge of disease dynamics through an auxiliary model, facilitating the integration of longitudinal data; and (iv) it introduces the Latent Average Stabilization (LAS) algorithm, which (a) enforces spatiotemporal consistency in the predicted progression at inference time and (b) allows us to derive a measure of the uncertainty for the prediction at the global and voxel level. We train and evaluate BrLP on 11,730 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects and validate its generalizability on an external test set comprising 2,257 MRIs from 962 subjects. Our experiments compare BrLP-generated MRI scans with real follow-up MRIs, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy compared to existing methods. The code is publicly available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-image generative models, they are prone to adversarial attacks and inadvertently generate unsafe, unethical content. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lacks scalability, and/or compromises generation quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style) -- all during test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of $\mathbf{20.01\%}$ in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is $\mathbf{\sim5}$x faster than the current state-of-the-art.

  _Fu Rong, Meng Lan, Qian Zhang, Lefei Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in a video according to textual descriptions, which requires the integration of multimodal information and temporal dynamics perception. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown great effectiveness across various video segmentation tasks. However, its application to offline RVOS is challenged by the translation of the text into effective prompts and a lack of global context awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel RVOS framework, termed MPG-SAM 2, to address these challenges. Specifically, MPG-SAM 2 employs a unified multimodal encoder to jointly encode video and textual features, generating semantically aligned video and text embeddings, along with multimodal class tokens. A mask prior generator utilizes the video embeddings and class tokens to create pseudo masks of target objects and global context. These masks are fed into the prompt encoder as dense prompts along with multimodal class tokens as sparse prompts to generate accurate prompts for SAM 2. To provide the online SAM 2 with a global view, we introduce a hierarchical global-historical aggregator, which allows SAM 2 to aggregate global and historical information of target objects at both pixel and object levels, enhancing the target representation and temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on several RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MPG-SAM 2 and the effectiveness of our proposed modules. The code is available atthis https URL.

  This paper aims to improve the performance of video multimodal large language models (MLLM) via long and rich context (LRC) modeling. As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM.

  3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) has recently revolutionized novel view synthesis in the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. However, most existing algorithms fail to fully capture the underlying structure, resulting in structural inconsistency. Additionally, they struggle with abrupt appearance variations, leading to inconsistent visual quality. To address these problems, we propose SEGS-SLAM, a structure-enhanced 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM, which achieves high-quality photorealistic mapping. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a structure-enhanced photorealistic mapping (SEPM) framework that, for the first time, leverages highly structured point cloud to initialize structured 3D Gaussians, leading to significant improvements in rendering quality. Second, we propose Appearance-from-Motion embedding (AfME), enabling 3D Gaussians to better model image appearance variations across different camera poses. Extensive experiments on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate that SEGS-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in photorealistic mapping quality, e.g., an improvement of $19.86\%$ in PSNR over MonoGS on the TUM RGB-D dataset for monocular cameras.

  Long-context video modeling is critical for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling them to process movies, online video streams, and so on. Despite its advances, handling long videos remains challenging due to the difficulty in efficiently understanding the extremely long video context. This paper aims to address this issue from aspects of model architecture, training data, training strategy and evaluation benchmark. First, we propose a novel Hierarchical video token Compression (HiCo) method, which leverages visual redundancy in long videos to compress long video context from Clip-level to Video-level, reducing the computation significantly while preserving essential details, achieving an extreme compression ratio of approximately 1/50 with almost no performance loss. Second, we introduce a multi-stage short-to-long learning scheme, a large-scale dataset of real-world long videos named LongVid, and a challenging ``Multi-Hop Needle-In-A-Video-Haystack'' benchmark. Finally, we build a powerful video MLLM named VideoChat-Flash, which shows a leading performance on both mainstream long and short video benchmarks at the 2B and 7B model scale. It first gets 99.1% accuracy over 10,000 frames in NIAH among open-source models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-vocabulary Scene Graph Generation (OV-SGG) overcomes the limitations of the closed-set assumption by aligning visual relationship representations with open-vocabulary textual representations. This enables the identification of novel visual relationships, making it applicable to real-world scenarios with diverse relationships. However, existing OV-SGG methods are constrained by fixed text representations, limiting diversity and accuracy in image-text alignment. To address these challenges, we propose the Relation-Aware Hierarchical Prompting (RAHP) framework, which enhances text representation by integrating subject-object and region-specific relation information. Our approach utilizes entity clustering to address the complexity of relation triplet categories, enabling the effective integration of subject-object information. Additionally, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate detailed region-aware prompts, capturing fine-grained visual interactions and improving alignment between visual and textual modalities. RAHP also introduces a dynamic selection mechanism within Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which adaptively selects relevant text prompts based on the visual content, reducing noise from irrelevant prompts. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome and Open Images v6 datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of open-vocabulary scene graph generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Oriented object detection in aerial images poses a significant challenge due to their varying sizes and orientations. Current state-of-the-art detectors typically rely on either two-stage or one-stage approaches, often employing Anchor-based strategies, which can result in computationally expensive operations due to the redundant number of generated anchors during training. In contrast, Anchor-free mechanisms offer faster processing but suffer from a reduction in the number of training samples, potentially impacting detection accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose the Hybrid-Anchor Rotation Detector (HA-RDet), which combines the advantages of both anchor-based and anchor-free schemes for oriented object detection. By utilizing only one preset anchor for each location on the feature maps and refining these anchors with our Orientation-Aware Convolution technique, HA-RDet achieves competitive accuracies, including 75.41 mAP on DOTA-v1, 65.3 mAP on DIOR-R, and 90.2 mAP on HRSC2016, against current anchor-based state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing computational resources.

  3D semantic field learning is crucial for applications like autonomous navigation, AR/VR, and robotics, where accurate comprehension of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints is essential. Existing methods struggle under sparse view conditions, relying on inefficient per-scene multi-view optimizations, which are impractical for many real-world tasks. To address this, we propose SLGaussian, a feed-forward method for constructing 3D semantic fields from sparse viewpoints, allowing direct inference of 3DGS-based scenes. By ensuring consistent SAM segmentations through video tracking and using low-dimensional indexing for high-dimensional CLIP features, SLGaussian efficiently embeds language information in 3D space, offering a robust solution for accurate 3D scene understanding under sparse view conditions. In experiments on two-view sparse 3D object querying and segmentation in the LERF and 3D-OVS datasets, SLGaussian outperforms existing methods in chosen IoU, Localization Accuracy, and mIoU. Moreover, our model achieves scene inference in under 30 seconds and open-vocabulary querying in just 0.011 seconds per query.

  Despite the recent strides in video generation, state-of-the-art methods still struggle with elements of visual detail. One particularly challenging case is the class of videos in which the intricate motion of the hand coupled with a mostly stable and otherwise distracting environment is necessary to convey the execution of some complex action and its effects. To address these challenges, we introduce a new method for video generation that focuses on hand-centric actions. Our diffusion-based method incorporates two distinct innovations. First, we propose an automatic method to generate the motion area -- the region in the video in which the detailed activities occur -- guided by both the visual context and the action text prompt, rather than assuming this region can be provided manually as is now commonplace. Second, we introduce a critical Hand Refinement Loss to guide the diffusion model to focus on smooth and consistent hand poses. We evaluate our method on challenging augmented datasets based on EpicKitchens and Ego4D, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of action clarity, especially of the hand motion in the target region, across diverse environments and actions.

  Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available atthis https URL.

  This paper introduces Neuro-Activated Vision Explanations (NAVE), a method for extracting and visualizing the internal representations of vision model encoders. By clustering feature activations, NAVE provides insights into learned semantics without fine-tuning. Using object localization, we show that NAVE's concepts align with image semantics. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the impact of training strategies and architectures on encoder representation capabilities. Additionally, we apply NAVE to study training artifacts in vision transformers and reveal how weak training strategies and spurious correlations degrade model performance. Our findings establish NAVE as a valuable tool for post-hoc model inspection and improving transparency in vision models.

  Diffusion-based image editing models have made remarkable progress in recent years. However, achieving high-quality video editing remains a significant challenge. One major hurdle is the absence of open-source, large-scale video editing datasets based on real-world data, as constructing such datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Moreover, video data requires a significantly larger number of tokens for representation, which substantially increases the training costs for video editing models. Lastly, current video editing models offer limited interactivity, often making it difficult for users to express their editing requirements effectively in a single attempt. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a dataset VIVID-10M and a baseline model VIVID. VIVID-10M is the first large-scale hybrid image-video local editing dataset aimed at reducing data construction and model training costs, which comprises 9.7M samples that encompass a wide range of video editing tasks. VIVID is a Versatile and Interactive VIdeo local eDiting model trained on VIVID-10M, which supports entity addition, modification, and deletion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a large VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we construct the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose a test-time stage-wise retracing search method (SWIRES), which enables effective and efficient test-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and test-time scaling, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 9.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Egocentric videos provide valuable insights into human interactions with the physical world, which has sparked growing interest in the computer vision and robotics communities. A critical challenge in fully understanding the geometry and dynamics of egocentric videos is dense scene reconstruction. However, the lack of high-quality labeled datasets in this field has hindered the effectiveness of current supervised learning methods. In this work, we aim to address this issue by exploring an self-supervised dynamic scene reconstruction approach. We introduce EgoMono4D, a novel model that unifies the estimation of multiple variables necessary for Egocentric Monocular 4D reconstruction, including camera intrinsic, camera poses, and video depth, all within a fast feed-forward framework. Starting from pretrained single-frame depth and intrinsic estimation model, we extend it with camera poses estimation and align multi-frame results on large-scale unlabeled egocentric videos. We evaluate EgoMono4D in both in-domain and zero-shot generalization settings, achieving superior performance in dense pointclouds sequence reconstruction compared to all baselines. EgoMono4D represents the first attempt to apply self-supervised learning for pointclouds sequence reconstruction to the label-scarce egocentric field, enabling fast, dense, and generalizable reconstruction.

- **[Unraveling the Connections between Flow Matching and Diffusion Probabilistic Models in Training-free Conditional Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07625)**  `arXiv:2411.07625`  
  _Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training-free conditional generation based on flow matching aims to leverage pre-trained unconditional flow matching models to perform conditional generation without retraining. Recently, a successful training-free conditional generation approach incorporates conditions via posterior sampling, which relies on the availability of a score function in the unconditional diffusion model. However, flow matching models do not possess an explicit score function, rendering such a strategy inapplicable. Approximate posterior sampling for flow matching has been explored, but it is limited to linear inverse problems. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching-based Posterior Sampling (FMPS) to expand its application scope. We introduce a correction term by steering the velocity field. This correction term can be reformulated to incorporate a surrogate score function, thereby bridging the gap between flow matching models and score-based posterior sampling. Hence, FMPS enables the posterior sampling to be adjusted within the flow matching framework. Further, we propose two practical implementations of the correction mechanism: one aimed at improving generation quality, and the other focused on computational efficiency. Experimental results on diverse conditional generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation quality compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness and generality of FMPS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present MEGA-Bench, an evaluation suite that scales multimodal evaluation to over 500 real-world tasks, to address the highly heterogeneous daily use cases of end users. Our objective is to optimize for a set of high-quality data samples that cover a highly diverse and rich set of multimodal tasks, while enabling cost-effective and accurate model evaluation. In particular, we collected 505 realistic tasks encompassing over 8,000 samples from 16 expert annotators to extensively cover the multimodal task space. Instead of unifying these problems into standard multi-choice questions (like MMMU, MMBench, and MMT-Bench), we embrace a wide range of output formats like numbers, phrases, code, \LaTeX, coordinates, JSON, free-form, etc. To accommodate these formats, we developed over 40 metrics to evaluate these tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks, MEGA-Bench offers a fine-grained capability report across multiple dimensions (e.g., application, input type, output format, skill), allowing users to interact with and visualize model capabilities in depth. We evaluate a wide variety of frontier vision-language models on MEGA-Bench to understand their capabilities across these dimensions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human-centric generative models are becoming increasingly popular, giving rise to various innovative tools and applications, such as talking face videos conditioned on text or audio prompts. The core of these capabilities lies in powerful pre-trained foundation models, trained on large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, many advanced methods rely on in-house data subject to various constraints, and other current studies fail to generate high-resolution face videos, which is mainly attributed to the significant lack of large-scale, high-quality face video datasets. In this paper, we introduce a human face video dataset, \textbf{DH-FaceVid-1K}. Our collection spans 1,200 hours in total, encompassing 270,043 video clips from over 20,000 individuals. Each sample includes corresponding speech audio, facial keypoints, and text annotations. Compared to other publicly available datasets, ours distinguishes itself through its multi-ethnic coverage and high-quality, comprehensive individual attributes. We establish multiple face video generation models supporting tasks such as text-to-video and image-to-video generation. In addition, we develop comprehensive benchmarks to validate the scaling law when using different proportions of proposed dataset. Our primary aim is to contribute a face video dataset, particularly addressing the underrepresentation of Asian faces in existing curated datasets and thereby enriching the global spectrum of face-centric data and mitigating demographic biases. \textbf{Project Page:}this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular Depth and Surface Normals Estimation (MDSNE) is crucial for tasks such as 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and underwater exploration. Current methods rely either on discriminative models, which struggle with transparent or reflective surfaces, or generative models, which, while accurate, are computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel deep learning model for MDSNE, specifically tailored for underwater environments, using a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Transformers, leveraging the strengths of both approaches. Training effective MDSNE models is often hampered by noisy real-world datasets and the limited generalization of synthetic datasets. To address this, we generate pseudo-labeled real data using multiple pre-trained MDSNE models. To ensure the quality of this data, we propose the Depth Normal Evaluation and Selection Algorithm (DNESA), which evaluates and selects the most reliable pseudo-labeled samples using domain-specific metrics. A lightweight student model is then trained on this curated dataset. Our model reduces parameters by 90% and training costs by 80%, allowing real-time 3D perception on resource-constrained devices. Key contributions include: a novel and efficient MDSNE model, the DNESA algorithm, a domain-specific data pipeline, and a focus on real-time performance and scalability. Designed for real-world underwater applications, our model facilitates low-cost deployments in underwater robots and autonomous vehicles, bridging the gap between research and practical implementation.

  Visual localization refers to the process of determining camera poses and orientation within a known scene representation. This task is often complicated by factors such as changes in illumination and variations in viewing angles. In this paper, we propose HGSLoc, a novel lightweight plug-and-play pose optimization framework, which integrates 3D reconstruction with a heuristic refinement strategy to achieve higher pose estimation accuracy. Specifically, we introduce an explicit geometric map for 3D representation and high-fidelity rendering, allowing the generation of high-quality synthesized views to support accurate visual localization. Our method demonstrates higher localization accuracy compared to NeRF-based neural rendering localization approaches. We introduce a heuristic refinement strategy, its efficient optimization capability can quickly locate the target node, while we set the step level optimization step to enhance the pose accuracy in the scenarios with small errors. With carefully designed heuristic functions, it offers efficient optimization capabilities, enabling rapid error reduction in rough localization estimations. Our method mitigates the dependence on complex neural network models while demonstrating improved robustness against noise and higher localization accuracy in challenging environments, as compared to neural network joint optimization strategies. The optimization framework proposed in this paper introduces novel approaches to visual localization by integrating the advantages of 3D reconstruction and the heuristic refinement strategy, which demonstrates strong performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including 7Scenes and Deep Blending dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A prior global topological map (e.g., the OpenStreetMap, OSM) can boost the performance of autonomous mapping by a ground mobile robot. However, the prior map is usually incomplete due to lacking labeling in partial paths. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an OSM maker using airborne sensors carried by low-altitude aircraft, where the core of the OSM maker is a novel efficient pathfinder approach based on LiDAR and camera data, i.e., a binary dual-stream road segmentation model. Specifically, a multi-scale feature extraction based on the UNet architecture is implemented for images and point clouds. To reduce the effect caused by the sparsity of point cloud, an attention-guided gated block is designed to integrate image and point-cloud features. To optimize the model for edge deployment that significantly reduces storage footprint and computational demands, we propose a binarization streamline to each model component, including a variant of vision transformer (ViT) architecture as the encoder of the image branch, and new focal and perception losses to optimize the model training. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our pathfinder method achieves SOTA accuracy with high efficiency in finding paths from the low-level airborne sensors, and we can create complete OSM prior maps based on the segmented road skeletons.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Combining Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with diffusion models offers a powerful method for executing image editing tasks based on human language instructions. However, language instructions alone often fall short in accurately conveying user requirements, particularly when users want to add, replace elements in specific areas of an image. Luckily, masks can effectively indicate the exact locations or elements to be edited, while they require users to precisely draw the shapes at the desired locations, which is highly user-unfriendly. To address this, we propose FlexEdit, an end-to-end image editing method that leverages both free-shape masks and language instructions for Flexible Editing. Our approach employs a VLLM in comprehending the image content, mask, and user instructions. Additionally, we introduce the Mask Enhance Adapter (MEA) that fuses the embeddings of the VLLM with the image data, ensuring a seamless integration of mask information and model output embeddings. Furthermore, we construct FSMI-Edit, a benchmark specifically tailored for free-shape mask, including 8 types of free-shape mask. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in LLM-based image editing, and our simple prompting technique stands out in its effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GaussianOcc, a systematic method that investigates the two usages of Gaussian splatting for fully self-supervised and efficient 3D occupancy estimation in surround views. First, traditional methods for self-supervised 3D occupancy estimation still require ground truth 6D poses from sensors during training. To address this limitation, we propose Gaussian Splatting for Projection (GSP) module to provide accurate scale information for fully self-supervised training from adjacent view projection. Additionally, existing methods rely on volume rendering for final 3D voxel representation learning using 2D signals (depth maps, semantic maps), which is both time-consuming and less effective. We propose Gaussian Splatting from Voxel space (GSV) to leverage the fast rendering properties of Gaussian splatting. As a result, the proposed GaussianOcc method enables fully self-supervised (no ground truth pose) 3D occupancy estimation in competitive performance with low computational cost (2.7 times faster in training and 5 times faster in rendering).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration.

  As the number of people affected by diseases in the gastrointestinal system is ever-increasing, a higher demand on preventive screening is inevitable. This will significantly increase the workload on gastroenterologists. To help reduce the workload, tools from computer vision may be helpful. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of constructing 3D models of whole sections of the human colon using image sequences from wireless capsule endoscope video, providing enhanced viewing for gastroenterologists. As capsule endoscope images contain distortion and artifacts non-ideal for many 3D reconstruction algorithms, the problem is challenging. However, recent developments of virtual graphics-based models of the human gastrointestinal system, where distortion and artifacts can be enabled or disabled, makes it possible to ``dissect'' the problem. The graphical model also provides a ground truth, enabling computation of geometric distortion introduced by the 3D reconstruction method. In this paper, most distortions and artifacts are left out to determine if it is feasible to reconstruct whole sections of the human gastrointestinal system by existing methods. We demonstrate that 3D reconstruction is possible using simultaneous localization and mapping. Further, to reconstruct the gastrointestinal wall surface from resulting point clouds, varying greatly in density, Poisson surface reconstruction is a good option. The results are promising, encouraging further research on this problem.

  Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) aim to simulate human subjective perception of image visual quality and aesthetic appeal. Despite distinct learning objectives, they have underlying interconnectedness due to consistent human assessment perception. In this paper, we propose Unified vision-language pre-training of Quality and Aesthetics (UniQA}), to extract useful and common representations from two tasks, thereby benefiting them simultaneously. However, the lack of text in the IQA datasets and the textual noise in the IAA datasets pose severe challenges for multimodal pre-training. To address this, we (1) utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate high-quality text descriptions; (2) use the generated text for IAA as metadata to purify noisy IAA data. To effectively adapt the pre-trained UniQA to downstream tasks, we further propose a lightweight adapter that utilizes versatile cues to fully exploit the extensive knowledge of the pre-trained model. UniQA demonstrates high competitiveness in various image assessment tasks, including classical IQA and IAA tasks, few-label IQA, and other downstream tasks, showing promise as a foundational assessment model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data augmentation (DA) is widely employed to improve the generalization performance of deep models. However, most existing DA methods employ augmentation operations with fixed or random magnitudes throughout the training process. While this fosters data diversity, it can also inevitably introduce uncontrolled variability in augmented data, which could potentially cause misalignment with the evolving training status of the target models. Both theoretical and empirical findings suggest that this misalignment increases the risks of both underfitting and overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose AdaAugment, an innovative and tuning-free adaptive augmentation method that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically and adaptively adjust augmentation magnitudes for individual training samples based on real-time feedback from the target network. Specifically, AdaAugment features a dual-model architecture consisting of a policy network and a target network, which are jointly optimized to adapt augmentation magnitudes in accordance with the model's training progress effectively. The policy network optimizes the variability within the augmented data, while the target network utilizes the adaptively augmented samples for training. These two networks are jointly optimized and mutually reinforce each other. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and deep architectures demonstrate that AdaAugment consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art DA methods in effectiveness while maintaining remarkable efficiency.

  Continuous Conditional Generative Modeling (CCGM) estimates high-dimensional data distributions, such as images, conditioned on scalar continuous variables (aka regression labels). While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task.

We present FieldNet, a novel deep learning framework for real-time shadow removal, optimised for resource-constrained hardware.

Trained on a dataset of 10,000 natural images augmented with synthetic shadows, FieldNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets (ISTD, ISTD+, SRD), with up to $9$x speed improvements (66 FPS on Nvidia 2080Ti) and superior shadow removal quality (PSNR: 38.67, SSIM: 0.991). Real-world case studies in precision agriculture robotics demonstrate the practical impact of FieldNet in enhancing weed detection accuracy. These advancements establish FieldNet as a robust, efficient solution for real-time vision tasks in field robotics and beyond.

  Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation often produce overconfident results misaligned with empirical observations. Such miscalibration, challenges their clinical translation. We propose to use marginal L1 average calibration error (mL1-ACE) as a novel auxiliary loss function to improve pixel-wise calibration without compromising segmentation quality. We show that this loss, despite using hard binning, is directly differentiable, bypassing the need for approximate but differentiable surrogate or soft binning approaches. Our work also introduces the concept of dataset reliability histograms which generalises standard reliability diagrams for refined visual assessment of calibration in semantic segmentation aggregated at the dataset level. Using mL1-ACE, we reduce average and maximum calibration error by 45% and 55% respectively, maintaining a Dice score of 87% on the BraTS 2021 dataset. We share our code here:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent advances in video action recognition achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, these models often lack robustness when faced with natural distribution shifts between training and test data. We propose two novel evaluation methods to assess model resilience to such distribution disparity. One method uses two different datasets collected from different sources and uses one for training and validation, and the other for testing. More precisely, we created dataset splits of HMDB-51 or UCF-101 for training, and Kinetics-400 for testing, using the subset of the classes that are overlapping in both train and test datasets. The other proposed method extracts the feature mean of each class from the target evaluation dataset's training data (i.e. class prototype) and estimates test video prediction as a cosine similarity score between each sample to the class prototypes of each target class. This procedure does not alter model weights using the target dataset and it does not require aligning overlapping classes of two different datasets, thus is a very efficient method to test the model robustness to distribution shifts without prior knowledge of the target distribution. We address the robustness problem by adversarial augmentation training - generating augmented views of videos that are "hard" for the classification model by applying gradient ascent on the augmentation parameters - as well as "curriculum" scheduling the strength of the video augmentations. We experimentally demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed adversarial augmentation approach over baselines across three state-of-the-art action recognition models - TSM, Video Swin Transformer, and Uniformer. The presented work provides critical insight into model robustness to distribution shifts and presents effective techniques to enhance video action recognition performance in a real-world deployment.

  Cropland maps are essential for remote sensing-based agricultural monitoring, providing timely insights without extensive field surveys. Machine learning enables large-scale mapping but depends on geo-referenced ground-truth data, which is costly to collect, motivating the use of global datasets in data-scarce regions. A key challenge is understanding how the quantity, quality, and proximity of the training data to the target region influences model performance. We evaluate this in Nigeria, using 1,827 manually labelled samples covering the whole country, and subsets of the Geowiki dataset: Nigeria-only, regional (Nigeria and neighbouring countries), and global. We extract pixel-wise multi-source time series arrays from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ERA5 climate, and a digital elevation model using Google Earth Engine, comparing Random Forests with LSTMs, including a lightweight multi-headed LSTM variant. Results show local data significantly boosts performance, with accuracy gains up to 0.246 (RF) and 0.178 (LSTM). Nigeria-only or regional data outperformed global data despite the lower amount of labels, with the exception of the multi-headed LSTM, which benefited from global data when local samples were absent. Sentinel-1, climate, and topographic data are critical data sources, with their removal reducing F1-score by up to 0.593. Addressing class imbalance also improved LSTM accuracy by up to 0.071. Our top-performing model (Nigeria-only LSTM) achieved an F1-score of 0.814 and accuracy of 0.842, matching the best global land cover product while offering stronger recall, critical for food security. We release code, data, maps, and an interactive web app to support future work.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large pretrained Transformer models can focus on either introducing a small number of new learnable parameters (parameter efficiency) or editing representations of a small number of tokens using lightweight modules (representation efficiency). While the pioneering method LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) inherently balances parameter, compute, and memory efficiency, many subsequent variants trade off compute and memory efficiency and/or performance to further reduce fine-tuning parameters. To address this limitation and unify parameter-efficient and representation-efficient fine-tuning, we propose Weight-Generative Fine-Tuning (WeGeFT, pronounced wee-gift), a novel approach that learns to generate fine-tuning weights directly from the pretrained weights. WeGeFT employs a simple low-rank formulation consisting of two linear layers, either shared across multiple layers of the pretrained model or individually learned for different layers. This design achieves multi-faceted efficiency in parameters, representations, compute, and memory, while maintaining or exceeding the performance of LoRA and its variants. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction following, code generation, and visual recognition verify the effectiveness of our proposed WeGeFT.

- **[Adaptive deep learning framework for robust unsupervised underwater image enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08983)**  `arXiv:2212.08983`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One of the main challenges in deep learning-based underwater image enhancement is the limited availability of high-quality training data. Underwater images are difficult to capture and are often of poor quality due to the distortion and loss of colour and contrast in water. This makes it difficult to train supervised deep learning models on large and diverse datasets, which can limit the model's performance. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to supervised underwater image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised underwater image enhancement framework that employs a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to train a deep learning model with probabilistic adaptive instance normalization (PAdaIN) and statistically guided multi-colour space stretch that produces realistic underwater images. The resulting framework is composed of a U-Net as a feature extractor and a PAdaIN to encode the uncertainty, which we call UDnet. To improve the visual quality of the images generated by UDnet, we use a statistically guided multi-colour space stretch module that ensures visual consistency with the input image and provides an alternative to training using a ground truth image. The proposed model does not need manual human annotation and can learn with a limited amount of data and achieves state-of-the-art results on underwater images. We evaluated our proposed framework on eight publicly-available datasets. The results show that our proposed framework yields competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches in quantitative as well as qualitative metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Capsule networks are biologically inspired neural networks that group neurons into vectors called capsules, each explicitly representing an object or one of its parts. The routing mechanism connects capsules in consecutive layers, forming a hierarchical structure between parts and objects, also known as a parse tree. Capsule networks often attempt to model all elements in an image, requiring large network sizes to handle complexities such as intricate backgrounds or irrelevant objects. However, this comprehensive modeling leads to increased parameter counts and computational inefficiencies. Our goal is to enable capsule networks to focus only on the object of interest, reducing the number of parse trees. We accomplish this with REM (Routing Entropy Minimization), a technique that minimizes the entropy of the parse tree-like structure. REM drives the model parameters distribution towards low entropy configurations through a pruning mechanism, significantly reducing the generation of intra-class parse trees. This empowers capsules to learn more stable and succinct representations with fewer parameters and negligible performance loss.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based models are powerful and interpretable approaches to neuro-symbolic learning and have shown promising results in classification and reinforcement learning settings without prior knowledge of the tasks. However, their performance is degraded by the thresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here that part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its failure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the networks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement method; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent nodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through experiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks (including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our disentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical representations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to that of their pre-translation counterparts. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a vibrant ecosystem of diverse architectures, each with unique strengths due to differences in design, training data, and objectives. However, most applications still rely on a single backend model, limiting coverage of capabilities and leading to inefficiencies in performance and token cost when tackling complex tasks. We highlight an underexploited opportunity: LLM routing data, produced when hosting platforms route diverse queries to different models, which can reveal comparative strengths across tasks. To address this, we propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks across five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing 103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models. Building on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework with three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query using both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level fusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers to similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities between models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as training data. Experiments show FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best individual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with optimal fusion configurations varying by benchmark, demonstrating the value of systematic LLM fusion in harnessing complementary strengths and improving overall performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  World models (WMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in prediction, generation, and planning tasks. Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and cannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in the digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed, they focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal data and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Graph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and graph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse tasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to aggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space by converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal embedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces action nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other nodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on six tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching, recommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation, and planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches domain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and demonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks. Our code for GWM is released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we analyze the optimization behaviour of common private learning optimization algorithms under heavy-tail class imbalanced distribution. We show that, in a stylized model, optimizing with Gradient Descent with differential privacy (DP-GD) suffers when learning low-frequency classes, whereas optimization algorithms that estimate second-order information do not. In particular, DP-AdamBC that removes the DP bias from estimating loss curvature is a crucial component to avoid the ill-condition caused by heavy-tail class imbalance, and empirically fits the data better with $\approx8\%$ and $\approx5\%$ increase in training accuracy when learning the least frequent classes on both controlled experiments and real data respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a longstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance reasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like Llama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular benchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be unreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a clean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while noisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure trustworthy conclusions.

  Artificial intelligence holds immense promise for transforming biology, yet a lack of standardized, cross domain, benchmarks undermines our ability to build robust, trustworthy models. Here, we present insights from a recent workshop that convened machine learning and computational biology experts across imaging, transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics to tackle this gap. We identify major technical and systemic bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity and noise, reproducibility challenges, biases, and the fragmented ecosystem of publicly available resources and propose a set of recommendations for building benchmarking frameworks that can efficiently compare ML models of biological systems across tasks and data modalities. By promoting high quality data curation, standardized tooling, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and open, collaborative platforms, we aim to accelerate the development of robust benchmarks for AI driven Virtual Cells. These benchmarks are crucial for ensuring rigor, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and will ultimately advance the field toward integrated models that drive new discoveries, therapeutic insights, and a deeper understanding of cellular systems.

- **[The Target Polish: A New Approach to Outlier-Resistant Non-Negative Matrix and Tensor Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10484)**  `arXiv:2507.10484`  
  _Paul Fogel, Christophe Geissler, George Luta_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces the "Target Polish," a robust and computationally efficient framework for nonnegative matrix and tensor factorization. Although conventional weighted NMF approaches are resistant to outliers, they converge slowly due to the use of multiplicative updates to minimize the objective criterion. In contrast, the Target Polish approach remains compatible with the Fast-HALS algorithm, which is renowned for its speed, by adaptively smoothing the data with a weighted median-based transformation. This innovation provides outlier resistance while maintaining the highly efficient additive update structure of Fast-HALS. Empirical evaluations using image datasets corrupted with structured (block) and unstructured (salt) noise demonstrate that the Target Polish approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art robust NMF methods and reduces computational time by an order of magnitude in the studied scenarios.

- **[Some remarks on gradient dominance and LQR policy optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10452)**  `arXiv:2507.10452`  
  _Eduardo D. Sontag_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Solutions of optimization problems, including policy optimization in reinforcement learning, typically rely upon some variant of gradient descent. There has been much recent work in the machine learning, control, and optimization communities applying the Polyak-≈Åojasiewicz Inequality (PLI) to such problems in order to establish an exponential rate of convergence (a.k.a. ``linear convergence'' in the local-iteration language of numerical analysis) of loss functions to their minima under the gradient flow. Often, as is the case of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate vanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear / locally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time LQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT and DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like conditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these generalizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects of errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from adversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a simulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic computations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from limited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of this issue. The lecture also discussed convergence and PLI-like properties of ``linear feedforward neural networks'' in feedback control, but this arXiv skips that part (to be updated). Much of the work described here was done in collaboration with Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Leilei Cui, Zhong-Ping Jiang, and Milad Siami.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language Models (VLMs) have emerged as general-purpose tools for addressing a variety of complex computer vision problems. Such models have been shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, lacking some basic visual understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks by constructing a series of tests that probe which components of design, specifically, may be lacking. Importantly, we go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, which simply measure the final performance of VLM response, by also comparing and contrasting it to the performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from the visual encoder, intermediate vision-language projection and LLM-decoder output. In doing so, we uncover shortcomings in VLMs and make a number of important observations about their capabilities, robustness and how they process visual information. We hope our insights will guide progress in further improving VLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) is able to build latent representations that generalize well to unseen data. However, only a few SSL techniques exist for the online CL setting, where data arrives in small minibatches, the model must comply with a fixed computational budget, and task boundaries are absent. We introduce Continual Latent Alignment (CLA), a novel SSL strategy for Online CL that aligns the representations learned by the current model with past representations to mitigate forgetting. We found that our CLA is able to speed up the convergence of the training process in the online scenario, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under the same computational budget. Surprisingly, we also discovered that using CLA as a pretraining protocol in the early stages of pretraining leads to a better final performance when compared to a full i.i.d. pretraining.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study addresses the challenge of balancing energy efficiency with performance in AI/ML models, focusing on DeepRX, a deep learning receiver based on a fully convolutional ResNet architecture. We evaluate the energy consumption of DeepRX, considering factors including FLOPs/Watt and FLOPs/clock, and find consistency between estimated and actual energy usage, influenced by memory access patterns. The research extends to comparing energy dynamics during training and inference phases. A key contribution is the application of knowledge distillation (KD) to train a compact DeepRX \textit{student} model that emulates the performance of the \textit{teacher} model but with reduced energy consumption. We experiment with different student model sizes, optimal teacher sizes, and KD hyperparameters. Performance is measured by comparing the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance versus Signal-to-Interference \& Noise Ratio (SINR) values of the distilled model and a model trained from scratch. The distilled models demonstrate a lower error floor across SINR levels, highlighting the effectiveness of KD in achieving energy-efficient AI solutions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The major task of any e-commerce search engine is to retrieve the most relevant inventory items, which best match the user intent reflected in a query. This task is non-trivial due to many reasons, including ambiguous queries, misaligned vocabulary between buyers, and sellers, over- or under-constrained queries by the presence of too many or too few tokens. To address these challenges, query reformulation is used, which modifies a user query through token dropping, replacement or expansion, with the objective to bridge semantic gap between query tokens and users' search intent. Early methods of query reformulation mostly used statistical measures derived from token co-occurrence frequencies from selective user sessions having clicks or purchases. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches, specifically transformer-based neural language models, or sequence-to-sequence models are being used for query reformulation task. However, these models do not utilize the semantic tags of a query token, which are significant for capturing user intent of an e-commerce query. In this work, we pose query reformulation as a token classification task, and solve this task by designing a dependency-aware transformer-based language model, TagBERT, which makes use of semantic tags of a token for learning superior query phrase embedding. Experiments on large, real-life e-commerce datasets show that TagBERT exhibits superior performance than plethora of competing models, including BERT, eBERT, and Sequence-to-Sequence transformer model for important token classification task.

  With the rise of smart mobility and shared e-mobility services, numerous advanced technologies have been applied to this field. Cloud-based traffic simulation solutions have flourished, offering increasingly realistic representations of the evolving mobility landscape. LLMs have emerged as pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including intelligent decision-making, user interaction, and real-time traffic analysis. As user demand for e-mobility continues to grow, delivering comprehensive end-to-end solutions has become crucial. In this paper, we present a cloud-based, LLM-powered shared e-mobility platform, integrated with a mobile application for personalized route recommendations. The optimization module is evaluated based on travel time and cost across different traffic scenarios. Additionally, the LLM-powered RAG framework is evaluated at the schema level for different users, using various evaluation methods. Schema-level RAG with XiYanSQL achieves an average execution accuracy of 0.81 on system operator queries and 0.98 on user queries.

  _Zhiyuan Zhao, Sitan Yang, Kin G. Olivares, Boris N. Oreshkin, Stan Vitebsky, Michael W. Mahoney, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-horizon time series forecasting has many practical applications such as demand forecasting. Accurate demand prediction is critical to help make buying and inventory decisions for supply chain management of e-commerce and physical retailers, and such predictions are typically required for future horizons extending tens of weeks. This is especially challenging during high-stake sales events when demand peaks are particularly difficult to predict accurately. However, these events are important not only for managing supply chain operations but also for ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT), a multi-horizon forecaster leveraging apriori-known context variables such as holiday and promotion events information for improving predictive performance. Our model consists of an encoder and decoder, both embedded with a novel Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA), designed to learn context-dependent alignment for peak demand forecasting. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on two large-scale proprietary datasets from a large e-commerce retailer. We demonstrate that TAT brings up to 30% accuracy improvement on peak demand forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

  _Yichen Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients, ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which, while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  In this paper, we design an algorithm to accelerate the diffusion process on the $SO(3)$ manifold. The inherently sequential nature of diffusion models necessitates substantial time for denoising perturbed data. To overcome this limitation, we proposed to adapt the numerical Picard iteration for the $SO(3)$ space. We demonstrate our algorithm on an existing method that employs diffusion models to address the pose ambiguity problem. Moreover, we show that this acceleration advantage occurs without any measurable degradation in task reward. The experiments reveal that our algorithm achieves a speed-up of up to 4.9$\times$, significantly reducing the latency for generating a single sample.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper examines the $L_p$ and $W^1_p$ norm approximation errors of ReLU neural networks for Korobov functions. In terms of network width and depth, we derive nearly optimal super-approximation error bounds of order $2m$ in the $L_p$ norm and order $2m-2$ in the $W^1_p$ norm, for target functions with $L_p$ mixed derivative of order $m$ in each direction. The analysis leverages sparse grid finite elements and the bit extraction technique. Our results improve upon classical lowest order $L_\infty$ and $H^1$ norm error bounds and demonstrate that the expressivity of neural networks is largely unaffected by the curse of dimensionality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motion capture (MoCap) data from wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) is vital for applications in sports science, but its utility is often compromised by missing data. Despite numerous imputation techniques, a systematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is lacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our evaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series, multivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To facilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap dataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate practitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing completely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent pattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic variables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks consistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex missingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean absolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate techniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the highest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical baseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving the integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.

  Early detection of dementia is critical for timely medical intervention and improved patient outcomes. Neuropsychological tests are widely used for cognitive assessment but have traditionally relied on manual scoring. Automatic dementia classification (ADC) systems aim to infer cognitive decline directly from speech recordings of such tests. We propose Demenba, a novel ADC framework based on state space models, which scale linearly in memory and computation with sequence length. Trained on over 1,000 hours of cognitive assessments administered to Framingham Heart Study participants, some of whom were diagnosed with dementia through adjudicated review, our method outperforms prior approaches in fine-grained dementia classification by 21\%, while using fewer parameters. We further analyze its scaling behavior and demonstrate that our model gains additional improvement when fused with large language models, paving the way for more transparent and scalable dementia assessment tools.

  _Vikas Dwivedi, Balaji Srinivasan, Monica Sigovan, Bruno Sixou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces the Kernel Adaptive Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (KAPI-ELM), an adaptive Radial Basis Function (RBF)-based extension of PI-ELM designed to solve both forward and inverse Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems involving localized sharp gradients. While PI-ELMs outperform the traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in speed due to their single-shot, least square optimization, this advantage comes at a cost: their fixed, randomly initialized input layer limits their ability to capture sharp gradients. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a lightweight Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework that, instead of adjusting each input layer parameter individually as in traditional backpropagation, learns a small set of hyperparameters defining the statistical distribution from which the input weights are drawn. This novel distributional optimization strategy -- combining BO for input layer distributional parameters with least-squares optimization for output layer network parameters -- enables KAPI-ELM to preserve PI-ELM's speed while matching or exceeding the expressiveness of PINNs. We validate the proposed methodology on several challenging forward and inverse PDE benchmarks, including a 1D singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equation, a 2D Poisson equation with sharp localized sources, and a time-dependent advection equation. Notably, KAPI-ELM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both forward and inverse settings. In stiff PDE regimes, it matches or even outperforms advanced methods such as the Extended Theory of Functional Connections (XTFC), while requiring nearly an order of magnitude fewer tunable parameters. These results establish the potential of KAPI-ELM as a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable physics-informed learning framework, especially in stiff PDE regimes.

We showcase feasibility on multiple benchmarks. The results suggest high target utility at moderate privacy leakage.

  Dynamic graph learning methods have recently emerged as powerful tools for modelling relational data evolving through time. However, despite extensive benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions, inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with stronger temporal reasoning abilities.

  Play style identification can provide valuable game design insights and enable adaptive experiences, with the potential to improve game playing agents. Previous work relies on domain knowledge to construct play trace representations using handcrafted features. More recent approaches incorporate the sequential structure of play traces but still require some level of domain abstraction. In this study, we explore the use of unsupervised CNN-LSTM autoencoder models to obtain latent representations directly from low-level play trace data in MicroRTS. We demonstrate that this approach yields a meaningful separation of different game playing agents in the latent space, reducing reliance on domain expertise and its associated biases. This latent space is then used to guide the exploration of diverse play styles within studied AI players.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tensor Network (TN) decompositions have emerged as an indispensable tool in Big Data analytics owing to their ability to provide compact low-rank representations, thus alleviating the ``Curse of Dimensionality'' inherent in handling higher-order data. At the heart of their success lies the concept of TN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions. However, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an intuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across different TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as empirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters inferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to demystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks through real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by illustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in widely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker decompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory graphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a perspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the corresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing cumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN design. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear and unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary physical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and deployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational contexts.

  _Obaidullah Zaland, Erik Elmroth, Monowar Bhuyan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning paradigm that enables participating devices to train privacy-preserved and collaborative models. FL has proven its benefits for robotic manipulation tasks. However, grasping tasks lack exploration in such settings where robots train a global model without moving data and ensuring data privacy. The main challenge is that each robot learns from data that is nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) and of low quantity. This exhibits performance degradation, particularly in robotic grasping. Thus, in this work, we propose MTF-Grasp, a multi-tier FL approach for robotic grasping, acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the non-IID data distribution across robots, including quantitative skewness. MTF-Grasp harnesses data quality and quantity across robots to select a set of "top-level" robots with better data distribution and higher sample count. It then utilizes top-level robots to train initial seed models and distribute them to the remaining "low-level" robots, reducing the risk of model performance degradation in low-level robots. Our approach outperforms the conventional FL setup by up to 8% on the quantity-skewed Cornell and Jacquard grasping datasets.

  _Cheng Sun, Zhen Zhang, Shaofu Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we study a second-order approach to policy optimization in reinforcement learning. Existing second-order methods often suffer from suboptimal sample complexity or rely on unrealistic assumptions about importance sampling. To overcome these limitations, we propose VR-CR-PN, a variance-reduced cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that integrates Hessian-aided variance reduction with second-order policy optimization, effectively addressing the distribution shift problem and achieving best-known sample complexity under general nonconvex conditions but without the need for importance sampling. We theoretically establish that VR-CR-PN achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-second-order stationary point, significantly improving upon the previous best result of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ under comparable assumptions. As an additional contribution, we introduce a novel Hessian estimator for the expected return function, which admits a uniform upper bound independent of the horizon length $H$, allowing the algorithm to achieve horizon-independent sample complexity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As machine learning gets adopted into the industry quickly, trustworthiness is increasingly in focus. Yet, efficiency and sustainability of robust training pipelines still have to be established. In this work, we consider a simple pipeline for training adversarially robust decision trees and investigate the efficiency of each step. Our pipeline consists of three stages. Firstly, we choose the perturbation size automatically for each dataset. For that, we introduce a simple algorithm, instead of relying on intuition or prior work. Moreover, we show that the perturbation size can be estimated from smaller models than the one intended for full training, and thus significant gains in efficiency can be achieved. Secondly, we train state-of-the-art adversarial training methods and evaluate them regarding both their training time and adversarial accuracy. Thirdly, we certify the robustness of each of the models thus obtained and investigate the time required for this. We find that verification time, which is critical to the efficiency of the full pipeline, is not correlated with training time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as Valley Fever, remains a significant public health concern in endemic regions of the southwestern United States. This study develops the first graph neural network (GNN) model for forecasting Valley Fever incidence in Arizona. The model integrates surveillance case data with environmental predictors using graph structures, including soil conditions, atmospheric variables, agricultural indicators, and air quality metrics. Our approach explores correlation-based relationships among variables influencing disease transmission. The model captures critical delays in disease progression through lagged effects, enhancing its capacity to reflect complex temporal dependencies in disease ecology. Results demonstrate that the GNN architecture effectively models Valley Fever trends and provides insights into key environmental drivers of disease incidence. These findings can inform early warning systems and guide resource allocation for disease prevention efforts in high-risk areas.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently gained significant attention for solving compliance minimization (CM) problems. However, these methods typically provide poor feature boundaries, are very expensive, and lack a systematic mechanism to control the design complexity. Herein, we address these limitations by proposing a mesh-free and simultaneous framework based on physics-informed Gaussian processes (GPs). In our approach, we parameterize the design and state variables with GP priors which have independent kernels but share a multi-output neural network (NN) as their mean function. The architecture of this NN is based on Parametric Grid Convolutional Attention Networks (PGCANs) which not only mitigate spectral bias issues, but also provide an interpretable mechanism to control design complexity. We estimate all the parameters of our GP-based representations by simultaneously minimizing the compliance, total potential energy, and residual of volume fraction constraint. Importantly, our loss function exclude all data-based residuals as GPs automatically satisfy them. We also develop computational schemes based on curriculum training and numerical integration to increase the efficiency and robustness of our approach which is shown to (1) produce super-resolution topologies with fast convergence, (2) achieve smaller compliance and less gray area fraction compared to traditional numerical methods, (3) provide control over fine-scale features, and (4) outperform competing ML-based methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning often struggles when training and test data distributions differ. Traditional domain generalization (DG) tackles this by including data from multiple source domains, which is impractical due to expensive data collection and annotation. Recent vision-language models like CLIP enable source-free domain generalization (SFDG) by using text prompts to simulate visual representations, reducing data demands. However, existing SFDG methods struggle with domain-specific confounders, limiting their generalization capabilities. To address this issue, we propose TDCRL (\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{L}earning), the first method to integrate causal inference into the SFDG setting. TDCRL operates in two steps: first, it employs data augmentation to generate style word vectors, combining them with class information to generate text embeddings to simulate visual representations; second, it trains a causal intervention network with a confounder dictionary to extract domain-invariant features. Grounded in causal learning, our approach offers a clear and effective mechanism to achieve robust, domain-invariant features, ensuring robust generalization. Extensive experiments on PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet show state-of-the-art performance, proving TDCRL effectiveness in SFDG.

  _Zhenyuan Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inductive bias is a key factor in spatial regression models, determining how well a model can learn from limited data and capture spatial patterns. This work revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted Regression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for modeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional Geographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial weighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed distance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize GNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields, sequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying heterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic methods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results also reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics, with local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios, and global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data. These findings highlight the importance of inductive bias in spatial modeling and suggest future directions, including learnable spatial weighting functions, hybrid neural architectures, and improved interpretability for models handling non-stationary spatial data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the dynamic realm of online recruitment, accurate job classification is paramount for optimizing job recommendation systems, search rankings, and labor market analyses. As job markets evolve, the increasing complexity of job titles and descriptions necessitates sophisticated models that can effectively leverage intricate relationships within job data. Traditional text classification methods often fall short, particularly due to their inability to fully utilize the hierarchical nature of industry categories. To address these limitations, we propose a novel representation learning and classification model that embeds jobs and hierarchical industry categories into a latent embedding space. Our model integrates the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system and an in-house hierarchical taxonomy, Carotene, to capture both graph and hierarchical relationships, thereby improving classification accuracy. By embedding hierarchical industry categories into a shared latent space, we tackle cold start issues and enhance the dynamic matching of candidates to job opportunities. Extensive experimentation on a large-scale dataset of job postings demonstrates the model's superior ability to leverage hierarchical structures and rich semantic features, significantly outperforming existing methods. This research provides a robust framework for improving job classification accuracy, supporting more informed decision-making in the recruitment industry.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences, posing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to remove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such approaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show that the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically plausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language abilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we put forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization by design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of memorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the dynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates isolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising general language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter and billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong generalization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real data demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is achievable. We open-source our code atthis http URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains, such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM (Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR 50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear operations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extracting cause and effect phrases from a sentence is an important NLP task, with numerous applications in various domains, including legal, medical, education, and scientific research. There are many unsupervised and supervised methods proposed for solving this task. Among these, unsupervised methods utilize various linguistic tools, including syntactic patterns, dependency tree, dependency relations, etc. among different sentential units for extracting the cause and effect phrases. On the other hand, the contemporary supervised methods use various deep learning based mask language models equipped with a token classification layer for extracting cause and effect phrases. Linguistic tools, specifically, dependency tree, which organizes a sentence into different semantic units have been shown to be very effective for extracting semantic pairs from a sentence, but existing supervised methods do not have any provision for utilizing such tools within their model framework. In this work, we propose DepBERT, which extends a transformer-based model by incorporating dependency tree of a sentence within the model framework. Extensive experiments over three datasets show that DepBERT is better than various state-of-the art supervised causality extraction methods.

  Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offer a safe and accessible means of connecting the human brain to external devices, with broad applications in home and clinical settings to enhance human capabilities. However, the high noise level and limited task-specific data in non-invasive signals constrain decoding capabilities. Recently, the adoption of self-supervised pre-training is transforming the landscape of non-invasive BCI research, enabling the development of brain foundation models to capture generic neural representations from large-scale unlabeled electroencephalography (EEG) signals with substantial noises. However, despite these advances, the field currently lacks comprehensive, practical and extensible benchmarks to assess the utility of the public foundation models across diverse BCI tasks, hindering their widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we present AdaBrain-Bench, a large-scale standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate brain foundation models in widespread non-invasive BCI tasks. AdaBrain-Bench encompasses a diverse collection of representative BCI decoding datasets spanning 7 key applications. It introduces a streamlined task adaptation pipeline integrated with multi-dimensional evaluation metrics and a set of adaptation tools. The benchmark delivers an inclusive framework for assessing generalizability of brain foundation models across key transfer settings, including cross-subject, multi-subject, and few-shot scenarios. We leverage AdaBrain-Bench to evaluate a suite of publicly available brain foundation models and offer insights into practices for selecting appropriate models in various scenarios. We make our benchmark pipeline available to enable reproducible research and external use, offering a continuously evolving platform to foster progress toward robust and generalized neural decoding solutions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning (SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view, one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as (i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have access to.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An increasing number of NLP applications interact with large language models (LLMs) through black-box APIs, making prompt engineering critical for controlling model outputs. While recent Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) methods iteratively refine prompts using model-generated feedback, textual gradients, they primarily focus on error correction and neglect valuable insights from correct predictions. This limits both their effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel APO framework centered on enhancing the feedback mechanism. We reinterpret the textual gradient as a form of negative reinforcement and introduce the complementary positive reinforcement to explicitly preserve beneficial prompt components identified through successful predictions. To mitigate the noise inherent in LLM-generated feedback, we introduce a technique called feedback diversification, which aggregates multiple feedback signals, emphasizing consistent, actionable advice while filtering out outliers. Motivated by the rapid evolution and diversity of available LLMs, we also formalize Continual Prompt Optimization (CPO), addressing the practical challenge of efficiently migrating optimized prompts between different model versions or API providers. Our experiments reveal that naive prompt migration often degrades performance due to loss of critical instructions. In contrast, our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significant accuracy improvements, faster convergence, and lower computational costs in both standard and migration scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Relational databases underpin critical infrastructure across a wide range of domains, yet the design of generalizable pre-training strategies for learning from relational databases remains an open challenge due to task heterogeneity. Specifically, there exist infinitely many possible downstream tasks, as tasks are defined based on relational schema graphs, temporal dependencies, and SQL-defined label logics. An effective pre-training framework is desired to take these factors into account in order to obtain task-aware representations. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying distribution that drives label generation, downstream tasks can benefit from relevant side-channel information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task Vector Estimation (TVE), a novel pre-training framework that constructs predictive supervisory signals via set-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs, explicitly modeling next-window relational dynamics. We formalize our approach through an information-theoretic lens, demonstrating that task-informed representations retain more relevant signals than those obtained without task priors. Extensive experiments on the RelBench benchmark show that TVE consistently outperforms traditional pre-training baselines. Our findings advocate for pre-training objectives that encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure as design principles for predictive modeling on relational databases.

  Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in time series classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast, dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available, while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and remains competitive in rich-resource settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural networks are capable of superposition -- representing more features than there are dimensions. Recent work considers the analogous concept for computation instead of storage, proposing theoretical constructions. But there has been little investigation into whether these circuits can be learned in practice. In this work, we investigate a toy model for the Universal-AND problem which computes the AND of all $m\choose 2$ pairs of $m$ sparse inputs. The hidden dimension that determines the number of non-linear activations is restricted to pressure the model to find a compute-efficient circuit, called compressed computation. We find that the training process finds a simple solution that does not correspond to theoretical constructions. It is fully dense -- every neuron contributes to every output. The solution circuit naturally scales with dimension, trading off error rates for neuron efficiency. It is similarly robust to changes in sparsity and other key parameters, and extends naturally to other boolean operations and boolean circuits. We explain the found solution in detail and compute why it is more efficient than the theoretical constructions at low sparsity. Our findings shed light on the types of circuits that models like to form and the flexibility of the superposition representation. This contributes to a broader understanding of network circuitry and interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In traffic prediction, the goal is to estimate traffic speed or flow in specific regions or road segments using historical data collected by devices deployed in each area. Each region or road segment can be viewed as an individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning (FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.

STAR integrates diverse signals by uniting LLM and GNN capabilities with industrial-scale paradigms including adaptive sampling and version management. It provides an end-to-end solution for developing and deploying embeddings in large-scale recommender systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Approximate machine unlearning (AMU) enables models to `forget' specific training data through specialized fine-tuning on a retained dataset subset. However, processing this retained subset still dominates computational runtime, while reductions of epochs also remain a challenge. We propose two complementary methods to accelerate classification-oriented AMU. First, \textbf{Blend}, a novel distribution-matching dataset condensation (DC), merges visually similar images with shared blend-weights to significantly reduce the retained set size. It operates with minimal pre-processing overhead and is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art DC methods. Second, our loss-centric method, \textbf{Accelerated-AMU (A-AMU)}, augments the unlearning objective to quicken convergence. A-AMU achieves this by combining a steepened primary loss to expedite forgetting with a novel, differentiable regularizer that matches the loss distributions of forgotten and in-distribution unseen data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual approach of data and loss-centric optimization dramatically reduces end-to-end unlearning latency across both single and multi-round scenarios, all while preserving model utility and privacy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically tackle unlearning efficiency by jointly designing a specialized dataset condensation technique with a dedicated accelerated loss function.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and State of Health (SOH) is essential for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) across a wide range of industrial applications. We propose a novel framework -- Reinforced Graph-Based Physics-Informed Neural Networks Enhanced with Dynamic Weights (RGPD) -- that combines physics-based supervision with advanced spatio-temporal learning. Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRNs) embed graph-convolutional filters within recurrent units to capture how node representations evolve over time. Graph Attention Convolution (GATConv) leverages a self-attention mechanism to compute learnable, edge-wise attention coefficients, dynamically weighting neighbor contributions for adaptive spatial aggregation. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) module is positioned between the Temporal Attention Unit (TAU) and GCRN to further improve the spatio-temporal learning. This module improves attention and prediction accuracy by dynamically scaling hidden representations to minimize noise and highlight informative features. To identify the most relevant physical constraints in each area, Q-learning agents dynamically assign weights to physics-informed loss terms, improving generalization across real-time industrial systems and reducing the need for manual tuning. In both RUL and SOH estimation tasks, the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating strong robustness and predictive accuracy across varied degradation patterns across three diverse industrial benchmark datasets.

  We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics simulation framework.

  We present EPT-2, the latest iteration in our Earth Physics Transformer (EPT) family of foundation AI models for Earth system forecasting. EPT-2 delivers substantial improvements over its predecessor, EPT-1.5, and sets a new state of the art in predicting energy-relevant variables-including 10m and 100m wind speed, 2m temperature, and surface solar radiation-across the full 0-240h forecast horizon. It consistently outperforms leading AI weather models such as Microsoft Aurora, as well as the operational numerical forecast system IFS HRES from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In parallel, we introduce a perturbation-based ensemble model of EPT-2 for probabilistic forecasting, called EPT-2e. Remarkably, EPT-2e significantly surpasses the ECMWF ENS mean-long considered the gold standard for medium- to longrange forecasting-while operating at a fraction of the computational cost. EPT models, as well as third-party forecasts, are accessible via thethis http URLplatform.

  Text classification plays a pivotal role in edge computing applications like industrial monitoring, health diagnostics, and smart assistants, where low latency and high accuracy are both key requirements. Generative classifiers, in particular, have been shown to exhibit robustness to out-of-distribution and noisy data, which is an extremely critical consideration for deployment in such real-time edge environments. However, deploying such models on edge devices faces computational and memory constraints. Post Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces model size and compute costs without retraining, making it ideal for edge deployment. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of generative and discriminative Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based text classification models with PTQ using the Brevitas quantization library. We evaluate both types of classifier models across multiple bitwidths and assess their robustness under regular and noisy input conditions. We find that while discriminative classifiers remain robust, generative ones are more sensitive to bitwidth, calibration data used during PTQ, and input noise during quantized inference. We study the influence of class imbalance in calibration data for both types of classifiers, comparing scenarios with evenly and unevenly distributed class samples including their effect on weight adjustments and activation profiles during PTQ. Using test statistics derived from nonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data during calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths for generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance. This study underscores the role of calibration data in PTQ and when generative classifiers succeed or fail under noise, aiding deployment in edge environments.

  How can large language models (LLMs) serve users with varying preferences that may conflict across cultural, political, or other dimensions? To advance this challenge, this paper establishes four key results. First, we demonstrate, through a large-scale multilingual human study with representative samples from five countries (N=15,000), that humans exhibit significantly more variation in preferences than the responses of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs. Second, we show that existing methods for preference dataset collection are insufficient for learning the diversity of human preferences even along two of the most salient dimensions of variability in global values, due to the underlying homogeneity of candidate responses. Third, we argue that this motivates the need for negatively-correlated sampling when generating candidate sets, and we show that simple prompt-based techniques for doing so significantly enhance the performance of alignment methods in learning heterogeneous preferences. Fourth, based on this novel candidate sampling approach, we collect and open-source Community Alignment, the largest and most representative multilingual and multi-turn preference dataset to date, featuring almost 200,000 comparisons from annotators spanning five countries. We hope that the Community Alignment dataset will be a valuable resource for improving the effectiveness of LLMs for a diverse global population.

  Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization (MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.

  Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, the rise of federated unlearning, designed to allow clients to erase their data from the global model, introduces new privacy concerns. Specifically, the gradient exchanges during the unlearning process can leak sensitive information about deleted data. In this paper, we introduce DRAGD, a novel attack that exploits gradient discrepancies before and after unlearning to reconstruct forgotten data. We also present DRAGDP, an enhanced version of DRAGD that leverages publicly available prior data to improve reconstruction accuracy, particularly for complex datasets like facial images.

  We introduce a dataset for classifying wellness dimensions in social media user posts, covering six key aspects: physical, emotional, social, intellectual, spiritual, and vocational. The dataset is designed to capture these dimensions in user-generated content, with a comprehensive annotation framework developed under the guidance of domain experts. This framework allows for the classification of text spans into the appropriate wellness categories. We evaluate both traditional machine learning models and advanced transformer-based models for this multi-class classification task, with performance assessed using precision, recall, and F1-score, averaged over 10-fold cross-validation. Post-hoc explanations are applied to ensure the transparency and interpretability of model decisions. The proposed dataset contributes to region-specific wellness assessments in social media and paves the way for personalized well-being evaluations and early intervention strategies in mental health. We adhere to ethical considerations for constructing and releasing our experiments and dataset publicly on Github.

  The usage of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods has become essential in practical applications, given the increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and the legislative requirements put forward in the latest years. A fundamental but often underestimated aspect of the explanations is their robustness, a key property that should be satisfied in order to trust the explanations. In this study, we provide some preliminary insights on evaluating the reliability of explanations in the specific case of unbalanced datasets, which are very frequent in high-risk use-cases, but at the same time considerably challenging for both AI models and XAI methods. We propose a simple evaluation focused on the minority class (i.e. the less frequent one) that leverages on-manifold generation of neighbours, explanation aggregation and a metric to test explanation consistency. We present a use-case based on a tabular dataset with numerical features focusing on the occurrence of frost events.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The hallmark feature of temporal-difference (TD) learning is bootstrapping: using value predictions to generate new value predictions. The vast majority of TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Clinical monitoring of functional decline in ALS relies on periodic assessments that may miss critical changes occurring between visits. To address this gap, semi-supervised regression models were developed to estimate rates of decline in a case series cohort by targeting ALSFRS- R scale trajectories with continuous in-home sensor monitoring data. Our analysis compared three model paradigms (individual batch learning and cohort-level batch versus incremental fine-tuned transfer learning) across linear slope, cubic polynomial, and ensembled self-attention pseudo-label interpolations. Results revealed cohort homogeneity across functional domains responding to learning methods, with transfer learning improving prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales in 28 of 32 contrasts (mean RMSE=0.20(0.04)), and individual batch learning for predicting the composite scale (mean RMSE=3.15(1.25)) in 2 of 3. Self-attention interpolation achieved the lowest prediction error for subscale-level models (mean RMSE=0.19(0.06)), capturing complex nonlinear progression patterns, outperforming linear and cubic interpolations in 20 of 32 contrasts, though linear interpolation proved more stable in all ALSFRS-R composite scale models (mean RMSE=0.23(0.10)). We identified distinct homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles across functional domains with respiratory and speech exhibiting patient-specific patterns benefiting from personalized incremental adaptation, while swallowing and dressing functions followed cohort-level trajectories suitable for transfer models. These findings suggest that matching learning and pseudo-labeling techniques to functional domain-specific homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles enhances predictive accuracy in ALS progression tracking. Integrating adaptive model selection within sensor monitoring platforms could enable timely interventions and scalable deployment in future multi-center studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large pretrained transformers, enabling them to solve new tasks implicit in example input-output pairs without any gradient updates. Despite its practical success, the mechanisms underlying ICL remain largely mysterious. In this work we study synthetic linear regression to probe how transformers implement learning at inference time. Previous works have demonstrated that transformers match the performance of learning rules such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression or gradient descent and have suggested ICL is facilitated in transformers through the learned implementation of one of these techniques. In this work, we demonstrate through a suite of out-of-distribution generalization experiments that transformers trained for ICL fail to generalize after shifts in the prompt distribution, a behaviour that is inconsistent with the notion of transformers implementing algorithms such as OLS. Finally, we highlight the role of the pretraining corpus in shaping ICL behaviour through a spectral analysis of the learned representations in the residual stream. Inputs from the same distribution as the training data produce representations with a unique spectral signature: inputs from this distribution tend to have the same top two singular vectors. This spectral signature is not shared by out-of-distribution inputs, and a metric characterizing the presence of this signature is highly correlated with low loss.

  _Santhosh Kumar Ravindran_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large foundation models are typically trained on data from multiple domains, with the data mixture--the proportion of each domain used--playing a critical role in model performance. The standard approach to selecting this mixture relies on trial and error, which becomes impractical for large-scale pretraining. We propose a systematic method to determine the optimal data mixture for any target domain using scaling laws. Our approach accurately predicts the loss of a model of size $N$ trained with $D$ tokens and a specific domain weight vector $h$. We validate the universality of these scaling laws by demonstrating their predictive power in three distinct and large-scale settings: large language model (LLM), native multimodal model (NMM), and large vision models (LVM) pretraining. We further show that these scaling laws can extrapolate to new data mixtures and across scales: their parameters can be accurately estimated using a few small-scale training runs, and used to estimate the performance at larger scales and unseen domain weights. The scaling laws allow to derive the optimal domain weights for any target domain under a given training budget ($N$,$D$), providing a principled alternative to costly trial-and-error methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we study how multi-head latent attention (MLA), a popular strategy for compressing key/value memory, affects a transformer's internal capacity during pretraining. Using a lightweight suite of Marchenko-Pastur (MP) diagnostics, we analyze the spectrum of the $W_{Q}W_{K}^\top$ gram matrix throughout training, comparing three variants: the standard multi-head attention (MHA) baseline, MLA-PreRoPE with rotary applied before compression, and MLA-Decoupled, which shares a single rotary sub-vector across all heads. Our random matrix analysis reveals \textbf{three key findings:} \textbf{ i)} capacity bottlenecks emerge locally: both MHA and MLA-PreRoPE exhibit sharp, early spikes in specific layers that persist and propagate, disrupting the balance between bulk and outlier directions; \textbf{ ii)} these spikes coincide with rank collapse, concentrating the model's expressivity into narrow subspaces; \textbf{ iii)} only the decoupled variant prevents this cascade, maintaining broad spectral support and suppressing outlier formation across layers. These results underscore that \emph{how} rotary embeddings are applied is just as critical as \emph{where} compression occurs. Sharing rotary components across heads mitigates spectral fragmentation and preserves representational capacity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative modeling of graphs with spatial structure is essential across many applications from computer graphics to spatial genomics. Recent flow-based generative models have achieved impressive results by gradually adding and then learning to remove noise from these graphs. Existing models, however, use graph neural network architectures that are independent of the noise level, limiting their expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce \textit{Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks} (NCGNs), a class of graph neural networks that dynamically modify their architecture according to the noise level during generation. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that as noise increases, (1) graphs require information from increasingly distant neighbors and (2) graphs can be effectively represented at lower resolutions. Based on these insights, we develop Dynamic Message Passing (DMP), a specific instantiation of NCGNs that adapts both the range and resolution of message passing to the noise level. DMP consistently outperforms noise-independent architectures on a variety of domains including $3$D point clouds, spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and images. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately attributing user visits to specific Points of Interest (POIs) is a foundational task for mobility analytics, personalized services, marketing and urban planning. However, POI attribution remains challenging due to GPS inaccuracies, typically ranging from 2 to 20 meters in real-world settings, and the high spatial density of POIs in urban environments, where multiple venues can coexist within a small radius (e.g., over 50 POIs within a 100-meter radius in dense city centers). Relying on proximity is therefore often insufficient for determining which POI was actually visited. We introduce \textsf{POIFormer}, a novel Transformer-based framework for accurate and efficient POI attribution. Unlike prior approaches that rely on limited spatiotemporal, contextual, or behavioral features, \textsf{POIFormer} jointly models a rich set of signals, including spatial proximity, visit timing and duration, contextual features from POI semantics, and behavioral features from user mobility and aggregated crowd behavior patterns--using the Transformer's self-attention mechanism to jointly model complex interactions across these dimensions. By leveraging the Transformer to model a user's past and future visits (with the current visit masked) and incorporating crowd-level behavioral patterns through pre-computed KDEs, \textsf{POIFormer} enables accurate, efficient attribution in large, noisy mobility datasets. Its architecture supports generalization across diverse data sources and geographic contexts while avoiding reliance on hard-to-access or unavailable data layers, making it practical for real-world deployment. Extensive experiments on real-world mobility datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines, particularly in challenging real-world settings characterized by spatial noise and dense POI clustering.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-based tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction). Despite their triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times, difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.

  In grocery e-commerce, customers often build ingredient baskets guided by dietary preferences but lack the expertise to create complete meals. Leveraging recipe knowledge to recommend complementary ingredients based on a partial basket is essential for improving the culinary experience. Traditional recipe completion methods typically predict a single missing ingredient using a leave-one-out strategy. However, they fall short in two key aspects: (i) they do not reflect real-world scenarios where multiple ingredients are often needed, and (ii) they overlook relationships among the missing ingredients themselves. To address these limitations, we reformulate basket completion as a set-to-set (S2S) recommendation problem, where an incomplete basket is input into a system that predicts a set of complementary ingredients. We introduce S2SRec2, a set-to-set ingredient recommendation framework based on a Set Transformer and trained in a multitask learning paradigm. S2SRec2 jointly learns to (i) retrieve missing ingredients from the representation of existing ones and (ii) assess basket completeness after prediction. These tasks are optimized together, enforcing accurate retrieval and coherent basket completion. Experiments on large-scale recipe datasets and qualitative analyses show that S2SRec2 significantly outperforms single-target baselines, offering a promising approach to enhance grocery shopping and inspire culinary creativity.

  Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.

  Flight delays are a significant challenge in the aviation industry, causing major financial and operational disruptions. To improve passenger experience and reduce revenue loss, flight delay prediction models must be both precise and generalizable across different networks. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines Queue-Theory with a simple attention model, referred to as the Queue-Theory SimAM (QT-SimAM). To validate our model, we used data from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, where our proposed QT-SimAM (Bidirectional) model outperformed existing methods with an accuracy of 0.927 and an F1 score of 0.932. To assess transferability, we tested the model on the EUROCONTROL dataset. The results demonstrated strong performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.826 and an F1 score of 0.791. Ultimately, this paper outlines an effective, end-to-end methodology for predicting flight delays. The proposed model's ability to forecast delays with high accuracy across different networks can help reduce passenger anxiety and improve operational decision-making

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models, such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN) layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and continually update an internal model state with respect to changing distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.

  Distributed pre-training of large models at scale often imposes heavy memory demands on individual nodes and incurs significant intra-node communication costs. We propose a novel alternative approach that reduces the memory requirements by training small, structured subnetworks of the model on separate workers. Unlike pipelining, our method avoids inter-node activation communication and maintains bandwidth requirements that are comparable to or lower than standard data parallel communication schemes based on all-reduce. We evaluate two subnetwork construction strategies guided by the principle of ensuring uniform representation of each parameter across the distributed training setup. Our results show that the stochastic block dropping technique consistently outperforms the width-wise subnetwork construction previously explored in federated learning. We empirically attribute this superior performance to stronger gradient alignment in subnetworks that retain blocks having skip connections. Preliminary experiments highlight the promise of our approach, achieving a 20-40% reduction in memory usage without any loss in performance.

Our experiments demonstate that gaze-informed RLHF achieves faster convergence while maintaining or slightly improving performance, thus, reducing computational costs during policy optimization. These results show that human gaze provides a valuable and underused signal for policy optimization, pointing to a promising direction for improving RLHF efficiency.

External validation was conducted in an independent cohort with 1,093 participants. The source code is available onthis https URL. Results: The projection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across modalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident cardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were predictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals added complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with the Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance, achieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across different outcomes. Findings were robustly replicated and validated in the external testing cohort. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate individualized CVD risk scores directly from PSG data. The resulting projection scores have the potential to be integrated into clinical practice, enhancing risk assessment and supporting personalized care.

  Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In order to improve the accuracy of cross-platform advertisement recommendation, a graph neural network (GNN)- based advertisement recommendation method is analyzed. Through multi-dimensional modeling, user behavior data (e.g., click frequency, active duration) reveal temporal patterns of interest evolution, ad content (e.g., type, tag, duration) influences semantic preferences, and platform features (e.g., device type, usage context) shape the environment where interest transitions occur. These factors jointly enable the GNN to capture the latent pathways of user interest migration across platforms. The experimental results are based on the datasets of three platforms, and Platform B reaches 0.937 in AUC value, which is the best performance. Platform A and Platform C showed a slight decrease in precision and recall with uneven distribution of ad labels. By adjusting the hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size and embedding dimension, the adaptability and robustness of the model in heterogeneous data are further improved.

  Artificial Intelligence-generated content has become increasingly popular, yet its malicious use, particularly the deepfakes, poses a serious threat to public trust and discourse. While deepfake detection methods achieve high predictive performance, they often exhibit biases across demographic attributes such as ethnicity and gender. In this work, we tackle the challenge of fair deepfake detection, aiming to mitigate these biases while maintaining robust detection capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel post-processing approach, referred to as Fairness-Oriented Final Layer Input Prioritising (Fair-FLIP), that reweights a trained model's final-layer inputs to reduce subgroup disparities, prioritising those with low variability while demoting highly variable ones. Experimental results comparing Fair-FLIP to both the baseline (without fairness-oriented de-biasing) and state-of-the-art approaches show that Fair-FLIP can enhance fairness metrics by up to 30% while maintaining baseline accuracy, with only a negligible reduction of 0.25%.Code is available on Github:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We explore the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling as a probabilistic last layer approach for deep neural networks (DNNs). While HMC is widely regarded as a gold standard for uncertainty estimation, the computational demands limit its application to large-scale datasets and large DNN architectures. Although the predictions from the sampled DNN parameters can be parallelized, the computational cost still scales linearly with the number of samples (similar to an ensemble). Last layer HMC (LL--HMC) reduces the required computations by restricting the HMC sampling to the final layer of a DNN, making it applicable to more data-intensive scenarios with limited computational resources. In this paper, we compare LL-HMC against five last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods across three real-world video datasets for driver action and intention. We evaluate the in-distribution classification performance, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Due to the stochastic nature of the probabilistic evaluations, we performed five grid searches for different random seeds to avoid being reliant on a single initialization for the hyperparameter configurations. The results show that LL--HMC achieves competitive in-distribution classification and OOD detection performance. Additional sampled last layer parameters do not improve the classification performance, but can improve the OOD detection. Multiple chains or starting positions did not yield consistent improvements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Function Calling is a crucial technique that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external systems through APIs. However, the high latency associated with LLM-based Function Calling significantly impacts user experience. This paper presents a novel approach called Oriented Distillation for Inline Acceleration (ODIA) that leverages online user interaction data to accelerate Function Calling. By automatically identifying "simple queries" from production traffic and distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller ones, our method reduces response latency by 45% (expected) and 78% (median) while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world deployment in a music application, where the smaller model successfully handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss. Our method requires minimal human intervention and continuously improves through automated data collection and model updating, making it a practical solution for production environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Timely identification of harmful brain activities via electroencephalography (EEG) is critical for brain disease diagnosis and treatment, which remains limited application due to inter-rater variability, resource constraints, and poor generalizability of existing artificial intelligence (AI) models. In this study, a convolutional neural network model, VIPEEGNet, was developed and validated using EEGs recorded from Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School. The VIPEEGNet was developed and validated using two independent datasets, collected between 2006 and 2020. The development cohort included EEG recordings from 1950 patients, with 106,800 EEG segments annotated by at least one experts (ranging from 1 to 28). The online testing cohort consisted of EEG segments from a subset of an additional 1,532 patients, each annotated by at least 10 experts. For the development cohort (n=1950), the VIPEEGNet achieved high accuracy, with an AUROC for binary classification of seizure, LPD, GPD, LRDA, GRDA, and "other" categories at 0.972 (95% CI, 0.957-0.988), 0.962 (95% CI, 0.954-0.970), 0.972 (95% CI, 0.960-0.984), 0.938 (95% CI, 0.917-0.959), 0.949 (95% CI, 0.941-0.957), and 0.930 (95% CI, 0.926-0.935). For multi classification, the sensitivity of VIPEEGNET for the six categories ranges from 36.8% to 88.2% and the precision ranges from 55.6% to 80.4%, and performance similar to human experts. Notably, the external validation showed Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)of 0.223 and 0.273, ranking top 2 among the existing 2,767 competing algorithms, while we only used 2.8% of the parameters of the first-ranked algorithm.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model based semantic communication framework is designed. Compared to standard neural network (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and decoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model based method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a transmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural network model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for follow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter. Next, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework over a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the CLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic information transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP model architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize semantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay and energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a proximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus finding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user. Simulation results show that our proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 40%, and the accumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Travel demand models are critical tools for planning, policy, and mobility system design. Traditional activity-based models (ABMs), although grounded in behavioral theories, often rely on simplified rules and assumptions, and are costly to develop and difficult to adapt across different regions. This paper presents a learning-based travel demand modeling framework that synthesizes household-coordinated daily activity patterns based on a household's socio-demographic profiles. The whole framework integrates population synthesis, coordinated activity generation, location assignment, and large-scale microscopic traffic simulation into a unified system. It is fully generative, data-driven, scalable, and transferable to other regions. A full-pipeline implementation is conducted in Los Angeles with a 10 million population. Comprehensive validation shows that the model closely replicates real-world mobility patterns and matches the performance of legacy ABMs with significantly reduced modeling cost and greater scalability. With respect to the SCAG ABM benchmark, the origin-destination matrix achieves a cosine similarity of 0.97, and the daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network yields a 0.006 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) and a 9.8% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). When compared to real-world observations from Caltrans PeMS, the evaluation on corridor-level traffic speed and volume reaches a 0.001 JSD and a 6.11% MAPE.

  The field of AI research is advancing at an unprecedented pace, enabling automated hypothesis generation and experimental design across diverse domains such as biology, mathematics, and artificial intelligence. Despite these advancements, there remains a significant gap in the availability of scalable advising systems capable of providing high-quality, well-reasoned feedback to refine proposed hypotheses and experimental designs. To address this challenge, we explore key factors that underlie the development of robust advising systems, including model size, context length, confidence estimation, and structured reasoning processes. Our findings reveal that a relatively small model, when equipped with a well-compressed literature database and a structured reasoning framework, can outperform powerful general-purpose language models such as Deepseek-R1 in terms of acceptance rates for self-ranked top-30% submissions to ICLR 2025. Moreover, when limited to high-confidence predictions, our system achieves an acceptance rate exceeding 90% on the ICLR 2025 test set, underscoring its potential to significantly enhance the quality and efficiency of hypothesis generation and experimental design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retention campaigns in customer relationship management often rely on churn prediction models evaluated using traditional metrics such as AUC and F1-score. However, these metrics fail to reflect financial outcomes and may mislead strategic decisions. We introduce e-Profits, a novel business-aligned evaluation metric that quantifies model performance based on customer-specific value, retention probability, and intervention costs. Unlike existing profit-based metrics such as Expected Maximum Profit, which assume fixed population-level parameters, e-Profits uses Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to estimate personalised retention rates and supports granular, per customer evaluation. We benchmark six classifiers across two telecom datasets (IBM Telco and Maven Telecom) and demonstrate that e-Profits reshapes model rankings compared to traditional metrics, revealing financial advantages in models previously overlooked by AUC or F1-score. The metric also enables segment-level insight into which models maximise return on investment for high-value customers. e-Profits is designed as an understandable, post hoc tool to support model evaluation in business contexts, particularly for marketing and analytics teams prioritising profit-driven decisions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming an essential tool for learning from graph-structured data, however uniform neighbor sampling and static fanout settings frequently limit GNNs' scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Adaptive Fanout Optimization Sampler (DAFOS), a novel approach that dynamically adjusts the fanout based on model performance and prioritizes important nodes during training. Our approach leverages node scoring based on node degree to focus computational resources on structurally important nodes, incrementing the fanout as the model training progresses. DAFOS also integrates an early stopping mechanism to halt training when performance gains diminish. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, ogbnarxiv, Reddit, and ogbn-products, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves training speed and accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art approach. DAFOS achieves a 3.57x speedup on the ogbn-arxiv dataset and a 12.6x speedup on the Reddit dataset while improving the F1 score from 68.5% to 71.21% on ogbn-arxiv and from 73.78% to 76.88% on the ogbn-products dataset, respectively. These results highlight the potential of DAFOS as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale GNN training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As a promising privacy-aware collaborative model training paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) is becoming popular in the design of distributed recommender systems. However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from two major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive item embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low training efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network environments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ various compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the parameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from model performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems, this paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS, which adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item embedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication rather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud server can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since gradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining the directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors compared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space. To accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS incorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of actions. Comprehensive experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate that FedRAS can reduce the size of communication payloads by up to 96.88%, while not sacrificing recommendation performance within various heterogeneous scenarios. We have open-sourced FedRAS atthis https URL.

  Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor). WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Traditional numerical methods often struggle with the complexity and scale of modeling pollutant transport across vast and dynamic oceanic domains. This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to simulate the dispersion of pollutants governed by the 2D advection-diffusion equation. The model achieves physically consistent predictions by embedding physical laws and fitting to noisy synthetic data, generated via a finite difference method (FDM), directly into the neural network training process. This approach addresses challenges such as non-linear dynamics and the enforcement of boundary and initial conditions. Synthetic data sets, augmented with varying noise levels, are used to capture real-world variability. The training incorporates a hybrid loss function including PDE residuals, boundary/initial condition conformity, and a weighted data fit term. The approach takes advantage of the Julia language scientific computing ecosystem for high-performance simulations, offering a scalable and flexible alternative to traditional solvers

  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most widely used techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By introducing a small number of trainable low-rank weight matrices, LoRA substantially reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated, offering significant advantages in memory consumption and computational efficiency compared to full fine-tuning. However, we observed that LoRA does not consistently provide speed improvements across all model architectures and training setups. Motivated by this inconsistency, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance and investigate the underlying factors limiting its speedup. Based on our findings, we propose several methods for more efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. We empirically evaluate these methods and compare them to LoRA, demonstrating that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance while delivering more consistent training speed improvements. Our work offers valuable insights and practical guidelines for practitioners seeking to optimize LLM fine-tuning under resource constraints.

  Farmers in developing regions like Karnataka, India, face a dual challenge: navigating extreme market and climate volatility while being excluded from the digital revolution due to literacy barriers. This paper presents a novel decision support system that addresses both challenges through a unique synthesis of machine learning and human-computer interaction. We propose a hybrid recommendation engine that integrates two predictive models: a Random Forest classifier to assess agronomic suitability based on soil, climate, and real-time weather data, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to forecast market prices for agronomically viable crops. This integrated approach shifts the paradigm from "what can grow?" to "what is most profitable to grow?", providing a significant advantage in mitigating economic risk. The system is delivered through an end-to-end, voice-based interface in the local Kannada language, leveraging fine-tuned speech recognition and high-fidelity speech synthesis models to ensure accessibility for low-literacy users. Our results show that the Random Forest model achieves 98.5% accuracy in suitability prediction, while the LSTM model forecasts harvest-time prices with a low margin of error. By providing data-driven, economically optimized recommendations through an inclusive interface, this work offers a scalable and impactful solution to enhance the financial resilience of marginalized farming communities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely employed in safety-critical domains, where ensuring their reliability is essential. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is an effective technique to enhance the reliability of DNNs in the presence of bit-flip faults. In order to handle the significant overhead of TMR, it is applied selectively on the parameters and components with the highest contribution at the model output. Hence, the accuracy of the selection criterion plays the key role on the efficiency of TMR. This paper presents an efficient TMR approach to enhance the reliability of DNNs against bit-flip faults using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method. Since XAI can provide valuable insights about the importance of individual neurons and weights in the performance of the network, they can be applied as the selection metric in TMR techniques. The proposed method utilizes a low-cost, gradient-based XAI technique known as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to calculate importance scores for DNN parameters. These scores are then used to enhance the reliability of the model, with the most critical weights being protected by TMR. The proposed approach is evaluated on two DNN models, VGG16 and AlexNet, using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results demonstrate that the method can protect the AlexNet model at a bit error rate of 10-4, achieving over 60% reliability improvement while maintaining the same overhead as state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications. This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on mobile devices, evaluatingthis http URL, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization, temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience. Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks, highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values, leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical clustering.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and designed prompts.In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly, benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility, while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM). CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model, enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing forecasting methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a "synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap, we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84% on different cyclization strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints. Code available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end, DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33% time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark.

  _Eun-Ji Park, Sangwon Yun_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation, we present a unified framework for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). By analyzing the geometric landscape of the objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show that this extension strictly reduces the approximation error and that after sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse so that the extended model coincides with the original one and there exists a path in the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase. Taken together, these results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior and simultaneously serves as an architecture-friendly regularizer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In order to increase the effectiveness of model training, data reduction is essential to data-centric AI. It does this by locating the most instructive examples in massive datasets. To increase data quality and training efficiency, the main difficulty is to choose the best examples rather than the complete datasets. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy based on Pointwise -Information (PVI). To enable a static method, we first use PVI to quantify instance difficulty and remove instances with low difficulty. Experiments show that the classifier performance is maintained with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% reduction in accuracy when 10%-30% of the data is removed. Second, we train the classifiers using a progressive learning strategy on examples sorted by increasing PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy gain over conventional training. Our findings imply that training a classifier on the chosen optimal subset may improve model performance and increase training efficiency when combined with an efficient data reduction strategy. Furthermore, we have adapted the PVI framework, which was previously limited to English datasets, to a variety of Chinese NLP tasks and base models, yielding insightful results for faster training and cross-lingual data reduction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series autoregression (AR) is a classical tool for modeling auto-correlations and periodic structures in real-world systems. We revisit this model from an interpretable machine learning perspective by introducing sparse autoregression (SAR), where $\ell_0$-norm constraints are used to isolate dominant periodicities. We formulate exact mixed-integer optimization (MIO) approaches for both stationary and non-stationary settings and introduce two scalable extensions: a decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy for temporally-varying SAR (TV-SAR), and a two-stage optimization scheme for spatially- and temporally-varying SAR (STV-SAR). These models enable scalable inference on real-world spatiotemporal datasets. We validate our framework on large-scale mobility and climate time series. On NYC ridesharing data, TV-SAR reveals interpretable daily and weekly cycles as well as long-term shifts due to COVID-19. On climate datasets, STV-SAR uncovers the evolving spatial structure of temperature and precipitation seasonality across four decades in North America and detects global sea surface temperature dynamics, including El Ni√±o. Together, our results demonstrate the interpretability, flexibility, and scalability of sparse autoregression for periodicity quantification in complex time series.

  Label Proportion Learning (LLP) addresses the classification problem where multiple instances are grouped into bags and each bag contains information about the proportion of each class. However, in practical applications, obtaining precise supervisory information regarding the proportion of instances in a specific class is challenging. To better align with real-world application scenarios and effectively leverage the proportional constraints of instances within tuples, this paper proposes a generalized learning framework \emph{MDPU}. Specifically, we first mathematically model the distribution of instances within tuples of arbitrary size, under the constraint that the number of positive instances is no less than that of negative instances. Then we derive an unbiased risk estimator that satisfies risk consistency based on the empirical risk minimization (ERM) method. To mitigate the inevitable overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced, leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the consistency of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons with other relevant baseline methods comprehensively validate the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

  With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance (e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category, analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling text properties by adding a learned bias to language model activations at inference time. So far, steering vectors have predominantly been evaluated in multiple-choice settings, while their effectiveness in free-form generation tasks remains understudied. Moving "Beyond Multiple Choice," we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of steering vectors in adaptively controlling topical focus, sentiment, toxicity, and readability in abstractive summaries of the NEWTS dataset. We find that steering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high steering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text quality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while preserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest control over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality trade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical trade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying steering vectors to free-form generation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated LoRA has emerged as a promising technique for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on distributed devices by reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, existing approaches often inadequately overlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data heterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency, particularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive federated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the convergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and communication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for federated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without requiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client resources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the LoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock convergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to approximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to state-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the constant development of new bias mitigation methods for machine learning, no method consistently succeeds, and a fundamental question remains unanswered: when and why do bias mitigation techniques fail? In this paper, we hypothesise that a key factor may be the often-overlooked but crucial step shared by many bias mitigation methods: the definition of subgroups. To investigate this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods across multiple vision and language classification tasks, systematically varying subgroup definitions, including coarse, fine-grained, intersectional, and noisy subgroups. Our results reveal that subgroup choice significantly impacts performance, with certain groupings paradoxically leading to worse outcomes than no mitigation at all. Our findings suggest that observing a disparity between a set of subgroups is not a sufficient reason to use those subgroups for mitigation. Through theoretical analysis, we explain these phenomena and uncover a counter-intuitive insight that, in some cases, improving fairness with respect to a particular set of subgroups is best achieved by using a different set of subgroups for mitigation. Our work highlights the importance of careful subgroup definition in bias mitigation and presents it as an alternative lever for improving the robustness and fairness of machine learning models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We argue that in-context learning (ICL) predictably arises from standard self-supervised next-token pretraining, rather than being an exotic emergent property. This work establishes the foundational principles of this emergence by focusing on in-distribution ICL, demonstrating how models necessarily adapt to context when trained on token sequences, especially from non-ergodic sources. Our information-theoretic framework precisely predicts these in-distribution ICL dynamics (i.e., context-dependent loss reduction). We verify this with experiments using synthetic datasets of differing types of correlational structure, reproducing characteristic phenomena like phase transitions in training loss for induction head formation and power-law scaling of in-context loss. We further show that a model's in-context performance on any task is mathematically coupled to the ensemble of tasks seen in pretraining, offering a fundamental explanation, grounded in architecture- and modality-independent principles, for such inference-time learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Serious Games (SGs) are nowadays shifting focus to include procedural content generation (PCG) in the development process as a means of offering personalized and enhanced player experience. However, the development of a framework to assess the impact of PCG techniques when integrated into SGs remains particularly challenging. This study proposes a methodology for automated evaluation of PCG integration in SGs, incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) game testing agents. To validate the proposed framework, a previously introduced SG featuring card game mechanics and incorporating three different versions of PCG for nonplayer character (NPC) creation has been deployed. Version 1 features random NPC creation, while versions 2 and 3 utilize a genetic algorithm approach. These versions are used to test the impact of different dynamic SG environments on the proposed framework's agents. The obtained results highlight the superiority of the DRL game testing agents trained on Versions 2 and 3 over those trained on Version 1 in terms of win rate (i.e. number of wins per played games) and training time. More specifically, within the execution of a test emulating regular gameplay, both Versions 2 and 3 peaked at a 97% win rate and achieved statistically significant higher (p=0009) win rates compared to those achieved in Version 1 that peaked at 94%. Overall, results advocate towards the proposed framework's capability to produce meaningful data for the evaluation of procedurally generated content in SGs.

  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

  Decision trees and forests have achieved successes in various real applications, most working with all testing classes known in training data. In this work, we focus on learning with augmented class via forests, where an augmented class may appear in testing data yet not in training data. We incorporate information of augmented class into trees' splitting, that is, augmented Gini impurity, a new splitting criterion is introduced to exploit some unlabeled data from testing distribution. We then develop the Learning with Augmented Class via Forests (short for LACForest) approach, which constructs shallow forests according to the augmented Gini impurity and then splits forests with pseudo-labeled augmented instances for better performance. We also develop deep neural forests via an optimization objective based on our augmented Gini impurity, which essentially utilizes the representation power of neural networks for forests. Theoretically, we present the convergence analysis for our augmented Gini impurity, and we finally conduct experiments to evaluate our approaches. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling.

  Because large language models are expensive to pretrain on different datasets, using smaller-scale experiments to decide on data is crucial for reducing costs. Which benchmarks and methods of making decisions from observed performance at small scale most accurately predict the datasets that yield the best large models? To empower open exploration of this question, we release models, data, and evaluations in DataDecide -- the most extensive open suite of models over differences in data and scale. We conduct controlled pretraining experiments across 25 corpora with differing sources, deduplication, and filtering up to 100B tokens, model sizes up to 1B parameters, and 3 random seeds. We find that the ranking of models at a single, small size (e.g., 150M parameters) is a strong baseline for predicting best models at our larger target scale (1B) (~80% of com parisons correct). No scaling law methods among 8 baselines exceed the compute-decision frontier of single-scale predictions, but DataDecide can measure improvement in future scaling laws. We also identify that using continuous likelihood metrics as proxies in small experiments makes benchmarks including MMLU, ARC, HellaSwag, MBPP, and HumanEval >80% predictable at the target 1B scale with just 0.01% of the compute.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the traditional view of reinforcement learning, the agent's goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes its expected sum of rewards. Once the agent finds this policy, the learning ends. This view contrasts with \emph{continual reinforcement learning}, where learning does not end, and agents are expected to continually learn and adapt indefinitely. Despite the clear distinction between these two paradigms of learning, much of the progress in continual reinforcement learning has been shaped by foundations rooted in the traditional view of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we first examine whether the foundations of traditional reinforcement learning are suitable for the continual reinforcement learning paradigm. We identify four key pillars of the traditional reinforcement learning foundations that are antithetical to the goals of continual learning: the Markov decision process formalism, the focus on atemporal artifacts, the expected sum of rewards as an evaluation metric, and episodic benchmark environments that embrace the other three foundations. We then propose a new formalism that sheds the first and the third foundations and replaces them with the history process as a mathematical formalism and a new definition of deviation regret, adapted for continual learning, as an evaluation metric. Finally, we discuss possible approaches to shed the other two foundations.

  _Runlong Zhou, Yi Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models often struggle with cross-mode knowledge retrieval -- the ability to access knowledge learned in one format (mode) when queried in another. We demonstrate that models trained on multiple data sources (e.g., Wikipedia and TinyStories) exhibit significantly reduced accuracy when retrieving knowledge in a format different from its original training mode. This paper quantitatively investigates this phenomenon through a controlled study of random token sequence memorization across different modes. We first explore dataset rewriting as a solution, revealing that effective cross-mode retrieval requires prohibitively extensive rewriting efforts that follow a sigmoid-like relationship. As an alternative, we propose CASCADE, a novel pretraining algorithm that uses cascading datasets with varying sequence lengths and computing losses on only the second half of each training sequence to capture knowledge at different scales. Our experiments demonstrate that CASCADE outperforms dataset rewriting approaches, even when compressed into a single model with a unified loss function. This work provides both qualitative evidence of cross-mode retrieval limitations and a practical solution to enhance language models' ability to access knowledge independently of its presentational format.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their adoption in healthcare remains limited. While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of foundation models for patient behavior monitoring through personal digital devices remains underexplored. The data generated by these devices are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel foundation model based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder, specifically designed to process real-world data from smartphones and wearable devices. We leveraged the discrete latent representation of this model to effectively perform two downstream tasks, suicide risk assessment and emotional state prediction, on different held-out clinical cohorts without the need of fine-tuning. We also highlight the existence of a trade-off between discrete and continuous latent structures, suggesting that hybrid models may be optimal for balancing accuracy across various supervised and unsupervised tasks.

  Fine-tuning has become the standard practice for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. However, the impact on model robustness is not well understood. In this work, we characterize the robustness-accuracy trade-off in fine-tuning. We evaluate the robustness and accuracy of fine-tuned models over 6 benchmark datasets and 7 different fine-tuning strategies. We observe a consistent trade-off between adversarial robustness and accuracy. Peripheral updates such as BitFit are more effective for simple tasks -- over 75% above the average measured by the area under the Pareto frontiers on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. In contrast, fine-tuning information-heavy layers, such as attention layers via Compacter, achieves a better Pareto frontier on more complex tasks -- 57.5% and 34.6% above the average on Caltech-256 and CUB-200, respectively. Lastly, we observe that the robustness of fine-tuning against out-of-distribution data closely tracks accuracy. These insights emphasize the need for robustness-aware fine-tuning to ensure reliable real-world deployments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce KodCode, a synthetic dataset that addresses the persistent challenge of acquiring high-quality, verifiable training data across diverse difficulties and domains for training Large Language Models for coding. Existing code-focused resources typically fail to ensure either the breadth of coverage (e.g., spanning simple coding tasks to advanced algorithmic problems) or verifiable correctness (e.g., unit tests). In contrast, KodCode comprises question-solution-test triplets that are systematically validated via a self-verification procedure. Our pipeline begins by synthesizing a broad range of coding questions, then generates solutions and test cases with additional attempts allocated to challenging problems. Finally, post-training data synthesis is done by rewriting questions into diverse formats and generating responses under a test-based reject sampling procedure from a reasoning model (DeepSeek R1). This pipeline yields a large-scale, robust and diverse coding dataset. KodCode is suitable for supervised fine-tuning and the paired unit tests also provide great potential for RL tuning. Fine-tuning experiments on coding benchmarks (HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that KodCode-tuned models achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing models like Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B.

  Efficient inference is critical for deploying deep learning models on edge AI devices. Low-bit quantization (e.g., 3- and 4-bit) with fixed-point arithmetic improves efficiency, while low-power memory technologies like analog nonvolatile memory enable further gains. However, these methods introduce non-ideal hardware behavior, including bit faults and device-to-device variability. We propose a regularization-based quantization-aware training (QAT) framework that supports fixed, learnable step-size, and learnable non-uniform quantization, achieving competitive results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Our method also extends to Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), demonstrating strong performance on 4-bit networks on CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech 101. Beyond quantization, our framework enables fault and variability-aware fine-tuning, mitigating stuck-at faults (fixed weight bits) and device resistance variability. Compared to prior fault-aware training, our approach significantly improves performance recovery under upto 20% bit-fault rate and 40% device-to-device variability. Our results establish a generalizable framework for quantization and robustness-aware training, enhancing efficiency and reliability in low-power, non-ideal hardware.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level fluency in text generation, which complicates the distinction between human-written and LLM-generated texts. This increases the risk of misuse and highlights the need for reliable detectors. Yet, existing detectors exhibit poor robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and attacked data, which is critical for real-world scenarios. Also, they struggle to provide interpretable evidence to support their decisions, thus undermining the reliability. In light of these challenges, we propose IPAD (Inverse Prompt for AI Detection), a novel framework consisting of a Prompt Inverter that identifies predicted prompts that could have generated the input text, and two Distinguishers that examine the probability that the input texts align with the predicted prompts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that IPAD outperforms the strongest baselines by 9.05% (Average Recall) on in-distribution data, 12.93% (AUROC) on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and 5.48% (AUROC) on attacked data. IPAD also performs robustly on structured datasets. Furthermore, an interpretability assessment is conducted to illustrate that IPAD enhances the AI detection trustworthiness by allowing users to directly examine the decision-making evidence, which provides interpretable support for its state-of-the-art detection results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While self-attention has been instrumental in the success of Transformers, it can lead to over-concentration on a few tokens during training, resulting in suboptimal information flow. Enforcing doubly-stochastic constraints in attention matrices has been shown to improve structure and balance in attention distributions. However, existing methods rely on iterative Sinkhorn normalization, which is computationally costly. In this paper, we introduce a novel, fully parallelizable doubly-stochastic attention mechanism based on sliced optimal transport, leveraging Expected Sliced Transport Plans (ESP). Unlike prior approaches, our method enforces doubly stochasticity without iterative Sinkhorn normalization, significantly enhancing efficiency. To ensure differentiability, we incorporate a temperature-based soft sorting technique, enabling seamless integration into deep learning models. Experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, including image classification, point cloud classification, sentiment analysis, and neural machine translation, demonstrate that our enhanced attention regularization consistently improves performance across diverse applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) are often closed-source, limiting developers to prompt tuning for aligning content generation with specific applications. While these models currently do not provide access to token logits, we argue that if such access were available, it would enable more powerful adaptation techniques beyond prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose a token-level probability reweighting framework that, given access to logits and a small amount of task-specific data, can effectively steer black-box LLMs toward application-specific content generation. Our approach views next-token prediction through the lens of supervised classification. We show that aligning black-box LLMs with task-specific data can be formulated as a label noise correction problem, leading to Plugin model -- an autoregressive probability reweighting model that operates solely on logits. We provide theoretical justification for why reweighting logits alone is sufficient for task adaptation. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets, LLMs, and reweighting models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, advocating for broader access to token logits in closed-source models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate detection of traffic anomalies is crucial for effective urban traffic management and congestion mitigation. We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.

  Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even with off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

  _Niket Patel, Guido Montufar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We define the local complexity of a neural network with continuous piecewise linear activations as a measure of the density of linear regions over an input data distribution. We show theoretically that ReLU networks that learn low-dimensional feature representations have a lower local complexity. This allows us to connect recent empirical observations on feature learning at the level of the weight matrices with concrete properties of the learned functions. In particular, we show that the local complexity serves as an upper bound on the total variation of the function over the input data distribution and thus that feature learning can be related to adversarial robustness. Lastly, we consider how optimization drives ReLU networks towards solutions with lower local complexity. Overall, this work contributes a theoretical framework towards relating geometric properties of ReLU networks to different aspects of learning such as feature learning and representation cost.

  Reliable prediction of pediatric obesity can offer a valuable resource to providers, helping them engage in timely preventive interventions before the disease is established. Many efforts have been made to develop ML-based predictive models of obesity, and some studies have reported high predictive performances. However, no commonly used clinical decision support tool based on existing ML models currently exists. This study presents a novel end-to-end pipeline specifically designed for pediatric obesity prediction, which supports the entire process of data extraction, inference, and communication via an API or a user interface. While focusing only on routinely recorded data in pediatric electronic health records (EHRs), our pipeline uses a diverse expert-curated list of medical concepts to predict the 1-3 years risk of developing obesity. Furthermore, by using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard in our design procedure, we specifically target facilitating low-effort integration of our pipeline with different EHR systems. In our experiments, we report the effectiveness of the predictive model as well as its alignment with the feedback from various stakeholders, including ML scientists, providers, health IT personnel, health administration representatives, and patient group representatives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Random feature (RF) method is a powerful kernel approximation technique, but is typically equipped with fixed activation functions, limiting its adaptability across diverse tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Random Feature Model with Learnable Activation Functions (RFLAF), which enhances the model expressivity by parameterizing activation functions as weighted sums of basis functions. Specifically, we propose to use radial basis functions (RBFs) as bases. We first analyze the RF model with a single RBF activation, deriving a novel kernel and presenting its theoretical properties. Extending this to multiple RBFs, we show that RFLAF significantly expands the function space of RF models while maintaining parameter efficiency. Experimental results across multiple tasks demonstrate that RFLAF consistently outperforms standard RF models with minimal extra computational cost. Furthermore, RFLAF showcases the ability of recovering the optimal activation function directly from data. Our work provides a deeper understanding of the component of learnable activation functions within modern neural networks architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have achieved promising results in various heterogeneous graph learning tasks, owing to their superiority in capturing the intricate relationships and diverse relational semantics inherent in heterogeneous graph structures. However, the neighborhood-fetching latency incurred by structure dependency in HGNNs makes it challenging to deploy for latency-constrained applications that require fast inference. Inspired by recent GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation frameworks, we introduce HG2M and HG2M+ to combine both HGNN's superior performance and MLP's efficient inference. HG2M directly trains student MLPs with node features as input and soft labels from teacher HGNNs as targets, and HG2M+ further distills reliable and heterogeneous semantic knowledge into student MLPs through reliable node distillation and reliable meta-path distillation. Experiments conducted on six heterogeneous graph datasets show that despite lacking structural dependencies, HG2Ms can still achieve competitive or even better performance than HGNNs and significantly outperform vanilla MLPs. Moreover, HG2Ms demonstrate a 379.24$\times$ speedup in inference over HGNNs on the large-scale IGB-3M-19 dataset, showcasing their ability for latency-sensitive deployments.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with equivariant properties have achieved significant success in modeling complex dynamic systems and molecular properties. However, their expressiveness ability is limited by: (1) Existing methods often overlook the over-smoothing issue caused by traditional GNN models, as well as the gradient explosion or vanishing problems in deep GNNs. (2) Most models operate on first-order information, neglecting that the real world often consists of second-order systems, which further limits the model's representation capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{Du}al \textbf{S}econd-order \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}rdinary Differential Equation (\method{}) for equivariant representation. Specifically, \method{} apply the dual second-order equivariant graph ordinary differential equations (Graph ODEs) on graph embeddings and node coordinates, simultaneously. Theoretically, we first prove that \method{} maintains the equivariant property. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that \method{} effectively alleviates the over-smoothing problem in both feature representation and coordinate update. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed \method{} mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem, facilitating the training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed \method{} compared to baselines.

  With the increase in the number of parameters in large language models, the process of pre-training and fine-tuning increasingly demands larger volumes of GPU memory. A significant portion of this memory is typically consumed by the optimizer state. To overcome this challenge, recent approaches such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)), low-rank gradient projection (GaLore (Zhao et al., 2024)), and blockwise optimization (BAdam (Luo et al., 2024)) have been proposed. However, in all these algorithms, the $\textit{effective rank of the weight updates remains low-rank}$, which can lead to a substantial loss of information from the gradient. This loss can be critically important, especially during the pre-training stage. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{FRUGAL}$ ($\textbf{F}$ull-$\textbf{R}$ank $\textbf{U}$pdates with $\textbf{G}$r$\textbf{A}$dient sp$\textbf{L}$itting), a new memory-efficient optimization framework. $\texttt{FRUGAL}$ leverages gradient splitting to perform low-dimensional updates using advanced algorithms (such as Adam), while updates along the remaining directions are executed via state-free methods like SGD or signSGD (Bernstein et al., 2018). Our framework can be integrated with various low-rank update selection techniques, including GaLore and BAdam. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our framework when using SGDM for low-dimensional updates and SGD for state-free updates. Additionally, our method consistently outperforms concurrent approaches across various fixed memory budgets, achieving state-of-the-art results in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks while balancing memory efficiency and performance metrics.

  Transformers have had tremendous impact for several sequence related tasks, largely due to their ability to retrieve from any part of the sequence via softmax based dot-product attention. This mechanism plays a crucial role in Transformer's performance. We analyze the gradients backpropagated through the softmax operation in the attention mechanism and observe that these gradients can often be small. This poor gradient signal backpropagation can lead to inefficient learning of parameters preceeding the attention operations. To this end, we introduce a new attention mechanism called LASER, which we analytically show to admit a larger gradient signal. We show that LASER attention can be implemented by making small modifications to existing attention implementations. We conduct experiments on autoregressive large language models (LLMs) with upto 7.7 billion parameters with an average improvement of upto 1.44% over standard attention on downstream evaluations and 1.65% finetuning improvements. Additionally, LASER demonstrates generalization performance improvement across a variety of tasks (vision, text and speech):Vision Transformer (ViT) on Imagenet, Conformer on the Librispeech speech-to-text and BERT with 2.2 billion parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study infinite-horizon average-reward reinforcement learning (RL) for Lipschitz MDPs, a broad class that subsumes several important classes such as linear and RKHS MDPs, function approximation frameworks, and develop an adaptive algorithm $\text{ZoRL}$ with regret bounded as $\mathcal{O}\big(T^{1 - d_{\text{eff.}}^{-1}}\big)$, where $d_{\text{eff.}}= 2d_\mathcal{S} + d_z + 3$, $d_\mathcal{S}$ is the dimension of the state space and $d_z$ is the zooming dimension. In contrast, algorithms with fixed discretization yield $d_{\text{eff.}} = 2(d_\mathcal{S} + d_\mathcal{A}) + 2$, $d_\mathcal{A}$ being the dimension of action space. $\text{ZoRL}$ achieves this by discretizing the state-action space adaptively and zooming into ''promising regions'' of the state-action space. $d_z$, a problem-dependent quantity bounded by the state-action space's dimension, allows us to conclude that if an MDP is benign, then the regret of $\text{ZoRL}$ will be small. The zooming dimension and $\text{ZoRL}$ are truly adaptive, i.e., the current work shows how to capture adaptivity gains for infinite-horizon average-reward RL. $\text{ZoRL}$ outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in experiments, thereby demonstrating the gains arising due to adaptivity.

  This review explores recent advancements in data fusion techniques and Transformer-based remote sensing applications in precision agriculture. Using a systematic, data-driven approach, we analyze research trends from 1994 to 2024, identifying key developments in data fusion, remote sensing, and AI-driven agricultural monitoring. While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in agricultural decision-making, challenges such as limited scalability, suboptimal feature extraction, and reliance on extensive labeled data persist. This study examines the comparative advantages of Transformer-based fusion methods, particularly their ability to model spatiotemporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous datasets for applications in soil analysis, crop classification, yield prediction, and disease detection. A comparative analysis of multimodal data fusion approaches is conducted, evaluating data types, fusion techniques, and remote sensing platforms. We demonstrate how Transformers outperform conventional models by enhancing prediction accuracy, mitigating feature redundancy, and optimizing large-scale data integration. Furthermore, we propose a structured roadmap for implementing data fusion in agricultural remote sensing, outlining best practices for ground-truth data selection, platform integration, and fusion model design. By addressing key research gaps and providing a strategic framework, this review offers valuable insights for advancing precision agriculture through AI-driven data fusion techniques.

  Despite their success in many domains, large language models (LLMs) remain under-studied in scenarios requiring optimal decision-making under uncertainty. This is crucial as many real-world applications, ranging from personalized recommendations to healthcare interventions, demand that LLMs not only predict but also actively learn to make optimal decisions through exploration. In this work, we measure LLMs' (in)ability to make optimal decisions in bandits, a state-less reinforcement learning setting relevant to many applications. We develop a comprehensive suite of environments, including both context-free and contextual bandits with varying task difficulties, to benchmark LLMs' performance. Motivated by the existence of optimal exploration algorithms, we propose efficient ways to integrate this algorithmic knowledge into LLMs: by providing explicit algorithm-guided support during inference; and through algorithm distillation via in-context demonstrations and fine-tuning, using synthetic data generated from these algorithms. Impressively, these techniques allow us to achieve superior exploration performance with smaller models, surpassing larger models on various tasks. We conducted an extensive ablation study to shed light on various factors, such as task difficulty and data representation, that influence the efficiency of LLM exploration. Additionally, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the LLM's exploration efficiency using the concept of regret, linking its ability to explore to the model size and underlying algorithm.

  Diffusion models have demonstrated their capabilities in modeling trajectories of multi-tasks. However, existing multi-task planners or policies typically rely on task-specific demonstrations via multi-task imitation, or require task-specific reward labels to facilitate policy optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL). They are costly due to the substantial human efforts required to collect expert data or design reward functions. To address these challenges, we aim to develop a versatile diffusion planner capable of leveraging large-scale inferior data that contains task-agnostic sub-optimal trajectories, with the ability to fast adapt to specific tasks. In this paper, we propose SODP, a two-stage framework that leverages Sub-Optimal data to learn a Diffusion Planner, which is generalizable for various downstream tasks. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we train a foundation diffusion planner that extracts general planning capabilities by modeling the versatile distribution of multi-task trajectories, which can be sub-optimal and has wide data coverage. Then for downstream tasks, we adopt RL-based fine-tuning with task-specific rewards to quickly refine the diffusion planner, which aims to generate action sequences with higher task-specific returns. Experimental results from multi-task domains including Meta-World and Adroit demonstrate that SODP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a small amount of data for reward-guided fine-tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the development of edge computing, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT). However, applying FL in mobile edge-cloud networks is greatly challenged by statistical heterogeneity and high communication overhead. To address it, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework called HFLDD, which integrates dataset distillation to generate approximately independent and equally distributed (IID) data, thereby improving the performance of model training. In particular, we partition the clients into heterogeneous clusters, where the data labels among different clients within a cluster are unbalanced while the data labels among different clusters are balanced. The cluster heads collect distilled data from the corresponding cluster members, and conduct model training in collaboration with the server. This training process is like traditional federated learning on IID data, and hence effectively alleviates the impact of non-IID data on model training. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the convergence behavior, communication overhead, and computational complexity of the proposed HFLDD. Extensive experimental results based on multiple public datasets demonstrate that when data labels are severely imbalanced, the proposed HFLDD outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both test accuracy and communication cost.

  Existing work on improving language model reasoning typically explores a single solution path, which can be prone to errors. Inspired by perspective-taking in social studies, this paper introduces DiPT, a novel approach that complements current reasoning methods by explicitly incorporating diversified viewpoints. This approach allows the model to gain a deeper understanding of the problem's context and identify the most effective solution path during the inference stage. Additionally, it provides a general data-centric AI recipe for augmenting existing data to improve their quality for fine-tuning.Our empirical results demonstrate that DiPT can be flexibly integrated into existing methods that focus on a single reasoning approach, enhancing their reasoning performance and stability when presented with paraphrased problems. Furthermore, we illustrate improved context understanding by maintaining the model's safe outputs against "jailbreaking" prompts intentionally designed to bypass safeguards built into deployed models. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with data enriched with diverse perspectives can boost the reasoning capabilities of the model compared to fine-tuning with raw data alone.

  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods have been shown to outperform hand-designed models and help to democratize AI. However, NAS methods often start from scratch with each new task, making them computationally expensive and limiting their applicability. Transfer learning is a practical alternative with the rise of ever-larger pretrained models. However, it is also bound to the architecture of the pretrained model, which inhibits proper adaptation of the architecture to different tasks, leading to suboptimal (and excessively large) models. We address both challenges at once by introducing a novel and practical method to \textit{transfer supernets}, which parameterize both weight and architecture priors, and efficiently finetune both to new tasks. This enables supernet transfer learning as a replacement for traditional transfer learning that also finetunes model architectures to new tasks. Through extensive experiments across multiple image classification tasks, we demonstrate that supernet transfer learning does not only drastically speed up the discovery of optimal models (3 to 5 times faster on average), but will also find better models than running NAS from scratch. The added model flexibility also increases the robustness of transfer learning, yielding positive transfer to even very different target datasets, especially with multi-dataset pretraining.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback is crucial for their safe and effective deployment. The human preference is typically represented through comparison where one response is chosen over another for a given prompt. However, standard preference datasets often lack explicit information on why a particular choice was made, presenting an ambiguity that can hinder efficient learning and robust alignment, especially given the high cost of acquiring extensive human annotations. While many studies focus on algorithmic improvements, this work adopts a data-centric perspective, exploring how to enhance learning from existing preference data. We propose augmenting standard preference pairs with rationales that explain the reasoning behind the human preference. Specifically, we introduce a simple and principled framework that leverages machine-generated rationales to enrich preference data for preference optimization algorithms. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that incorporating rationales improves learning efficiency. Extensive experiments reveal some advantages: rationale-augmented learning accelerates convergence and can achieve higher final model performance. Furthermore, this approach is versatile and compatible with various direct preference optimization algorithms. Our findings showcase the potential of thoughtful data design in preference learning, demonstrating that enriching existing datasets with explanatory rationales can help unlock improvements in model alignment and annotation efficiency.

  Neural models learn data representations that lie on low-dimensional manifolds, yet modeling the relation between these representational spaces is an ongoing challenge. By integrating spectral geometry principles into neural modeling, we show that this problem can be better addressed in the functional domain, mitigating complexity, while enhancing interpretability and performances on downstream tasks. To this end, we introduce a multi-purpose framework to the representation learning community, which allows to: (i) compare different spaces in an interpretable way and measure their intrinsic similarity; (ii) find correspondences between them, both in unsupervised and weakly supervised settings, and (iii) to effectively transfer representations between distinct spaces. We validate our framework on various applications, ranging from stitching to retrieval tasks, and on multiple modalities, demonstrating that Latent Functional Maps can serve as a swiss-army knife for representation alignment.

  Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) focuses on individual documents during retrieval and, as a result, falls short in handling networked documents which are very popular in many applications such as citation graphs, social media, and knowledge graphs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG), which tackles the fundamental challenges in retrieving textual subgraphs and integrating the joint textual and topological information into Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance its generation. To enable efficient textual subgraph retrieval, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer strategy that retrieves the optimal subgraph structure in linear time. To achieve graph context-aware generation, incorporate textual graphs into LLMs through two complementary views-the text view and the graph view-enabling LLMs to more effectively comprehend and utilize the graph context. Extensive experiments on graph reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that in scenarios requiring multi-hop reasoning on textual graphs, our GRAG approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art RAG methods. Our datasets as well as codes of GRAG are available atthis https URL.

  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have revolutionized many areas of machine learning, particularly in natural language and data sequence processing. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has demonstrated its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) a promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we proposed a new neural networks architecture inspired by KAN and the LSTM, the Temporal Kolomogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). TKANs combined the strenght of both networks, it is composed of Recurring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (RKANs) Layers embedding memory management. This innovation enables us to perform multi-step time series forecasting with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the limitations of traditional models in handling complex sequential patterns, the TKAN architecture offers significant potential for advancements in fields requiring more than one step ahead forecasting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attribution methods are primarily designed to study input component contributions to individual model predictions. However, some research applications require a summary of attribution patterns across the entire dataset to facilitate the interpretability of the scrutinized models at a task-level rather than an instance-level. It specifically applies when the localization of important input information is supposed to be stable for a specific problem but remains unidentified among numerous components. In this paper, we present a dataset-wise attribution method called Integrated Gradient Correlation (IGC) that enables region-specific analysis by a direct summation over associated components, and further relates the sum of all attributions to a model prediction score (correlation). We demonstrate IGC on synthetic data and fMRI neural signals (NSD dataset) with the study of the representation of image features in the brain and the estimation of the visual receptive field of neural populations. The resulting IGC attributions reveal selective patterns, coherent with respective model objectives.

  _Ziyi Chen, Xiaocong Yang, Jiacheng Lin, Chenkai Sun, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang, Jie Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Introduced to enhance the efficiency of large language model (LLM) inference, speculative decoding operates by having a smaller model generate a draft. A larger target model then reviews this draft to align with its output, and any acceptance by the target model results in a reduction of the number of the target model runs, ultimately improving efficiency. However, the drafting process in speculative decoding includes slow autoregressive generation and allocates equal time to generating tokens, irrespective of their importance. These inefficiencies collectively contribute to the suboptimal performance of speculative decoding. To further improve LLM inference, we introduce Cascade Speculative Drafting (CS Drafting), a speculative execution algorithm that incorporates two types of cascades. The Vertical Cascade eliminates autoregressive generation from neural models, while the Horizontal Cascade optimizes time allocation in drafting for improved efficiency. Combining both cascades, CS Drafting achieves greater speedup compared to the baselines in our experiments, while preserving the same output distribution as the target model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pan-sharpening algorithm utilizes panchromatic image and multispectral image to obtain a high spatial and high spectral image. However, the optimizations of the algorithms are designed with different standards. We adopt the simple matrix equation to describe the Pan-sharpening problem. The solution existence condition and the acquirement of spectral and spatial resolution are discussed. A down-sampling enhancement method was introduced for better acquiring the spatial and spectral down-sample matrices. By the generalized inverse theory, we derived two forms of general inverse matrix formulations that can correspond to the two prominent classes of Pan-sharpening methods, that is, component substitution and multi-resolution analysis methods. Specifically, the Gram Schmidt Adaptive(GSA) was proved to follow the general inverse matrix formulation of component substitution. A model prior to the general inverse matrix of the spectral function was rendered. The theoretical errors are analyzed. Synthetic experiments and real data experiments are implemented. The proposed methods are better and sharper than other methods qualitatively in both synthetic and real experiments. The down-sample enhancement effect is shown of better results both quantitatively and qualitatively in real experiments. The generalized inverse matrix theory help us better understand the Pan-sharpening.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive achievements in graph classification, they often need abundant task-specific labels, which could be extensively costly to acquire. A credible solution is to explore additional labeled graphs to enhance unsupervised learning on the target domain. However, how to apply GNNs to domain adaptation remains unsolved owing to the insufficient exploration of graph topology and the significant domain discrepancy. In this paper, we propose Coupled Contrastive Graph Representation Learning (CoCo), which extracts the topological information from coupled learning branches and reduces the domain discrepancy with coupled contrastive learning. CoCo contains a graph convolutional network branch and a hierarchical graph kernel network branch, which explore graph topology in implicit and explicit manners. Besides, we incorporate coupled branches into a holistic multi-view contrastive learning framework, which not only incorporates graph representations learned from complementary views for enhanced understanding, but also encourages the similarity between cross-domain example pairs with the same semantics for domain alignment. Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that our CoCo outperforms these competing baselines in different settings generally.

  To effectively operate in various dynamic scenarios, RL agents must be resilient to unexpected changes in their environment. Previous work on this form of resilience has focused on single-agent settings. In this work, we introduce and formalize a multi-agent variant of resilience, which we term group resilience. We further hypothesize that collaboration with other agents is key to achieving group resilience; collaborating agents adapt better to environmental perturbations in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings. We test our hypothesis empirically by evaluating different collaboration protocols and examining their effect on group resilience. Our experiments show that all the examined collaborative approaches achieve higher group resilience than their non-collaborative counterparts.

  _Wenjing Zhang, Wei Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing asynchronous MARL methods based on MacDec-POMDP typically construct training trajectory buffers by simply sampling limited and biased data at the endpoints of macro-actions, and directly apply conventional MARL methods on the buffers. As a result, these methods lead to an incomplete and inaccurate representation of the macro-action execution process, along with unsuitable credit assignments. To solve these problems, the Temporal Macro-action Value Factorization (ToMacVF) is proposed to achieve fine-grained temporal credit assignment for macro-action contributions. A centralized training buffer, called Macro-action Segmented Joint Experience Replay Trajectory (Mac-SJERT), is designed to incorporate with ToMacVF to collect accurate and complete macro-action execution information, supporting a more comprehensive and precise representation of the macro-action process. To ensure principled and fine-grained asynchronous value factorization, the consistency requirement between joint and individual macro-action selection called Temporal Macro-action based IGM (To-Mac-IGM) is formalized, proving that it generalizes the synchronous cases. Based on To-Mac-IGM, a modularized ToMacVF architecture, which satisfies CTDE principle, is designed to conveniently integrate previous value factorization methods. Next, the ToMacVF algorithm is devised as an implementation of the ToMacVF architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to asynchronous baselines, our ToMacVF algorithm not only achieves optimal performance but also exhibits strong adaptability and robustness across various asynchronous multi-agent experimental scenarios.

  _Kang Li, Ming Li, Wenkang Ji, Zhiyong Sun, Shiyu Zhao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel cooperative herding strategy through backstepping control barrier functions (CBFs), which coordinates multiple herders to herd a group of evaders safely towards a designated goal region. For the herding system with heterogeneous groups involving herders and evaders, the behavior of the evaders can only be influenced indirectly by the herders' motion, especially when the evaders follow an inverse dynamics model and respond solely to repulsive interactions from the herders. This indirect interaction mechanism inherently renders the overall system underactuated. To address this issue, we first construct separate CBFs for the dual objectives of goal reaching and collision avoidance, which ensure both herding completion and safety guarantees. Then, we reformulate the underactuated herding dynamics into a control-affine structure and employ a backstepping approach to recursively design control inputs for the hierarchical barrier functions, avoiding taking derivatives of the higher-order system. Finally, we present a cooperative herding strategy based on backstepping CBFs that allow herders to safely herd multiple evaders into the goal region. In addition, centralized and decentralized implementations of the proposed algorithm are developed, further enhancing its flexibility and applicability. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and safety of the proposed strategy in multi-robot herding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many of society's most pressing challenges, from pandemic response to supply chain disruptions to climate adaptation, emerge from the collective behavior of millions of autonomous agents making decisions over time. Large Population Models (LPMs) offer an approach to understand these complex systems by simulating entire populations with realistic behaviors and interactions at unprecedented scale. LPMs extend traditional modeling approaches through three key innovations: computational methods that efficiently simulate millions of agents simultaneously, mathematical frameworks that learn from diverse real-world data streams, and privacy-preserving communication protocols that bridge virtual and physical environments. This allows researchers to observe how agent behavior aggregates into system-level outcomes and test interventions before real-world implementation. While current AI advances primarily focus on creating "digital humans" with sophisticated individual capabilities, LPMs develop "digital societies" where the richness of interactions reveals emergent phenomena. By bridging individual agent behavior and population-scale dynamics, LPMs offer a complementary path in AI research illuminating collective intelligence and providing testing grounds for policies and social innovations before real-world deployment. We discuss the technical foundations and some open problems here. LPMs are implemented by the AgentTorch framework (this http URL)

  Social learning is a powerful mechanism through which agents learn about the world from others. However, humans don't always choose to observe others, since social learning can carry time and cognitive resource costs. How do people balance social and non-social learning? In this paper, we propose a rational mentalizing model of the decision to engage in social learning. This model estimates the utility of social learning by reasoning about the other agent's goal and the informativity of their future actions. It then weighs the utility of social learning against the utility of self-exploration (non-social learning). Using a multi-player treasure hunt game, we show that our model can quantitatively capture human trade-offs between social and non-social learning. Furthermore, our results indicate that these two components allow agents to flexibly apply social learning to achieve their goals more efficiently.

  As cities evolve toward more complex and multimodal transportation systems, the need for human-centered multi-agent simulation tools has never been more urgent. Yet most existing platforms remain limited - they often separate different types of road users, rely on scripted or pre-defined behaviors, overlook public transit users as active participants, and are rarely designed with accessibility in mind for non-technical users. To address this gap, this paper presents the specifications of a multi-agent simulation platform designed to support real-time, human-centered, and immersive studies of all road users, accompanied by open-source scripts for replication. Using high-fidelity immersive virtual environments, our platform enables interaction across public transit users, pedestrians, cyclists, automated vehicles, and drivers. The architecture is modular, extensible, and designed for accessibility. The system integrates hardware-specific modules - including an omnidirectional treadmill, a seating arrangement, a smart trainer, and an actuated cockpit. Additionally, the platform collects multimodal physiological, neurological, and behavioral data through embedded sensing devices such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and wrist-based biosensors. To show the usability of this system, we present three use cases. Simulation for All aims to lower the barrier to entry for high-fidelity transportation simulation, support experimentation across disciplines, and advance our understanding of multimodal mobility in complex urban environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on a wide range of complex reasoning tasks, yet further gains are often possible by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple models. While multi-agent frameworks can improve solution quality by leveraging multiple LLMs, existing methods are often computationally expensive, both at training and inference time. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges by training only a single leader LLM to coordinate a team of untrained peer agents. To this end, we propose Multi-agent guided Leader Policy \textbf{O}ptimization (MLPO), a novel approach which trains the leader to evaluate and synthesize agent responses without auxiliary value networks or explicit agent feedback. Leaders trained with MLPO exhibit improved performance not only when interacting with the agent team at inference time, but also enjoy improved performance when deployed in single-agent settings without the team. Empirical results on Big-Bench Hard (BBH), MATH, and MMLU demonstrate that our framework achieves substantial performance improvements over both single-agent and multi-agent baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of training a single, flexible leader for collaborative reasoning in multi-agent LLM systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable promise for tackling complex tasks by breaking them down into subtasks that are iteratively planned, executed, observed, and refined. Despite their effectiveness, these systems often incur high latency because real-world problems frequently demand multiple iterative cycles of reasoning steps. To address this challenge, we propose M1-Parallel, a framework that concurrently runs multiple multi-agent teams in parallel to uncover distinct solution paths. By leveraging an event-driven communication model with asynchronous messaging, M1-Parallel efficiently capitalizes on the inherent diversity of valid plans to either reduce end-to-end latency or boost task completion rates. Our experiments on complex tasks show that M1-Parallel with early termination achieves up to $2.2\times$ speedup while preserving accuracy, and that M1-Parallel with aggregation yields higher task completion rates. We further investigate strategies aimed at encouraging diverse execution plans but observe no additional performance gains over repeated sampling. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of parallel plan execution for optimizing multi-agent systems for real-world, high-complexity reasoning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In robot manipulation, robot learning has become a prevailing approach. However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the MeanFlow Identity, our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Autonomous driving systems are highly dependent on sensors like cameras, LiDAR, and inertial measurement units (IMU) to perceive the environment and estimate their motion. Among these sensors, perception-based sensors are not protected from harsh weather and technical failures. Although existing methods show robustness against common technical issues like rotational misalignment and disconnection, they often degrade when faced with dynamic environmental factors like weather conditions. To address these problems, this research introduces a novel deep learning-based motion estimator that integrates visual, inertial, and millimeter-wave radar data, utilizing each sensor strengths to improve odometry estimation accuracy and reliability under adverse environmental conditions such as snow, rain, and varying light. The proposed model uses advanced sensor fusion techniques that dynamically adjust the contributions of each sensor based on the current environmental condition, with radar compensating for visual sensor limitations in poor visibility. This work explores recent advancements in radar-based odometry and highlights that radar robustness in different weather conditions makes it a valuable component for pose estimation systems, specifically when visual sensors are degraded. Experimental results, conducted on the Boreas dataset, showcase the robustness and effectiveness of the model in both clear and degraded environments.

  Optimization has been widely used to generate smooth trajectories for motion planning. However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness. Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and show high performance with thousands of segments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual coverage path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires agents to strategically coordinate UAV motion and camera control to maximize coverage, minimize redundancy, and maintain battery efficiency. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on environment-specific reward formulations that lack semantic adaptability. This study proposes Prompt-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL), a novel approach that integrates the zero-shot reasoning ability and in-context learning capability of large language models with curiosity-driven RL. PIRL leverages semantic feedback from an LLM, GPT-3.5, to dynamically shape the reward function of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) RL policy guiding the agent in position and camera adjustments for optimal visual coverage. The PIRL agent is trained using OpenAI Gym and evaluated in various environments. Furthermore, the sim-to-real-like ability and zero-shot generalization of the agent are tested by operating the agent in Webots simulator which introduces realistic physical dynamics. Results show that PIRL outperforms multiple learning-based baselines such as PPO with static rewards, PPO with exploratory weight initialization, imitation learning, and an LLM-only controller. Across different environments, PIRL outperforms the best-performing baseline by achieving up to 14% higher visual coverage in OpenAI Gym and 27% higher in Webots, up to 25% higher battery efficiency, and up to 18\% lower redundancy, depending on the environment. The results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-guided reward shaping in complex spatial exploration tasks and suggest a promising direction for integrating natural language priors into RL for robotics.

  Developing robust locomotion controllers for bipedal robots with closed kinematic chains presents unique challenges, particularly since most reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simplify these parallel mechanisms into serial models during training. We demonstrate that this simplification significantly impairs sim-to-real transfer by failing to capture essential aspects such as joint coupling, friction dynamics, and motor-space control characteristics. In this work, we present an RL framework that explicitly incorporates closed-chain dynamics and validate it on our custom-built robot TopA. Our approach enhances policy robustness through symmetry-aware loss functions, adversarial training, and targeted network regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our integrated approach achieves stable locomotion across diverse terrains, significantly outperforming methods based on simplified kinematic models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel framework for whole-body torque control of humanoid robots without joint torque sensors, designed for systems with electric motors and high-ratio harmonic drives. The approach integrates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for friction modeling and Unscented Kalman Filtering (UKF) for joint torque estimation, within a real-time torque control architecture. PINNs estimate nonlinear static and dynamic friction from joint and motor velocity readings, capturing effects like motor actuation without joint movement. The UKF utilizes PINN-based friction estimates as direct measurement inputs, improving torque estimation robustness. Experimental validation on the ergoCub humanoid robot demonstrates improved torque tracking accuracy, enhanced energy efficiency, and superior disturbance rejection compared to the state-of-the-art Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA), using a dynamic balancing experiment. The framework's scalability is shown by consistent performance across robots with similar hardware but different friction characteristics, without re-identification. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with position control highlights the advantages of the proposed torque control approach. The results establish the method as a scalable and practical solution for sensorless torque control in humanoid robots, ensuring torque tracking, adaptability, and stability in dynamic environments.

  The rapid emergence of foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), has introduced a transformative paradigm in robotics. These models offer powerful capabilities in semantic understanding, high-level reasoning, and cross-modal generalization, enabling significant advances in perception, planning, control, and human-robot interaction. This critical review provides a structured synthesis of recent developments, categorizing applications across simulation-driven design, open-world execution, sim-to-real transfer, and adaptable robotics. Unlike existing surveys that emphasize isolated capabilities, this work highlights integrated, system-level strategies and evaluates their practical feasibility in real-world environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct and natural interaction is essential for intuitive human-robot collaboration, eliminating the need for additional devices such as joysticks, tablets, or wearable sensors. In this paper, we present a lightweight deep learning-based hand gesture recognition system that enables humans to control collaborative robots naturally and efficiently. This model recognizes eight distinct hand gestures with only 1,103 parameters and a compact size of 22 KB, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%. To further optimize the model for real-world deployment on edge devices, we applied quantization and pruning using TensorFlow Lite, reducing the final model size to just 7 KB. The system was successfully implemented and tested on a Universal Robot UR5 collaborative robot within a real-time robotic framework based on ROS2. The results demonstrate that even extremely lightweight models can deliver accurate and responsive hand gesture-based control for collaborative robots, opening new possibilities for natural human-robot interaction in constrained environments.

  _Marc Kaufeld, Mattia Piccinini, Johannes Betz_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This research introduces MP-RBFN, a novel formulation leveraging Radial Basis Function Networks for efficiently learning Motion Primitives derived from optimal control problems for autonomous driving. While traditional motion planning approaches based on optimization are highly accurate, they are often computationally prohibitive. In contrast, sampling-based methods demonstrate high performance but impose constraints on the geometric shape of trajectories. MP-RBFN combines the strengths of both by coupling the high-fidelity trajectory generation of sampling-based methods with an accurate description of vehicle dynamics. Empirical results show compelling performance compared to previous methods, achieving a precise description of motion primitives at low inference times. MP-RBFN yields a seven times higher accuracy in generating optimized motion primitives compared to existing semi-analytic approaches. We demonstrate the practical applicability of MP-RBFN for motion planning by integrating the method into a sampling-based trajectory planner. MP-RBFN is available as open-source software atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for addressing complex control problems, particularly those involving underactuated robotic systems. However, in some cases, policies may require refinement to achieve optimal performance and robustness aligned with specific task objectives. In this paper, we propose an approach for fine-tuning Deep RL policies using Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to enhance control performance for underactuated robots. Our method involves initially training an RL agent with Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) using a surrogate reward function designed to approximate complex specific scoring metrics. We subsequently refine this learned policy through a zero-order optimization step employing the Separable Natural Evolution Strategy (SNES), directly targeting the original score. Experimental evaluations conducted in the context of the 2nd AI Olympics with RealAIGym at IROS 2024 demonstrate that our evolutionary fine-tuning significantly improves agent performance while maintaining high robustness. The resulting controllers outperform established baselines, achieving competitive scores for the competition tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Touch is recognized as a vital sense for humans and an equally important modality for robots, especially for dexterous manipulation, material identification, and scenarios involving visual occlusion. Building upon very recent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature Octopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its predecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from multiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects on-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld tactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile sensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with Octopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will showcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile inputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5 will identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how to handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also plan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items. With live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress and limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in this exciting field. Code for Octopi-1.5 and design files for the TMI gripper are available atthis https URL.

- **[Customize Harmonic Potential Fields via Hybrid Optimization over Homotopic Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09858)**  `arXiv:2507.09858`  
  _Shuaikang Wang, Tiecheng Guo, Meng Guo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe navigation within a workspace is a fundamental skill for autonomous robots to accomplish more complex tasks. Harmonic potentials are artificial potential fields that are analytical, globally convergent and provably free of local minima. Thus, it has been widely used for generating safe and reliable robot navigation control policies. However, most existing methods do not allow customization of the harmonic potential fields nor the resulting paths, particularly regarding their topological properties. In this paper, we propose a novel method that automatically finds homotopy classes of paths that can be generated by valid harmonic potential fields. The considered complex workspaces can be as general as forest worlds consisting of numerous overlapping star-obstacles. The method is based on a hybrid optimization algorithm that searches over homotopy classes, selects the structure of each tree-of-stars within the forest, and optimizes over the continuous weight parameters for each purged tree via the projected gradient descent. The key insight is to transform the forest world to the unbounded point world via proper diffeomorphic transformations. It not only facilitates a simpler design of the multi-directional D-signature between non-homotopic paths, but also retain the safety and convergence properties. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments are conducted for non-trivial scenarios, where the navigation potentials are customized for desired homotopic properties. Project page:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual homing.

  _Zainab Ali, Lujayn Al-Amir, Ali Safa_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for high-precision yet low memory and compute complexity inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers) where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context, this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance. Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that by carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to achieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during this work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting the future of surrounding agents and accordingly planning a safe, goal-directed trajectory are crucial for automated vehicles. Current methods typically rely on imitation learning to optimize metrics against the ground truth, often overlooking how scene understanding could enable more holistic trajectories. In this paper, we propose Plan-MAE, a unified pretraining framework for prediction and planning that capitalizes on masked autoencoders. Plan-MAE fuses critical contextual understanding via three dedicated tasks: reconstructing masked road networks to learn spatial correlations, agent trajectories to model social interactions, and navigation routes to capture destination intents. To further align vehicle dynamics and safety constraints, we incorporate a local sub-planning task predicting the ego-vehicle's near-term trajectory segment conditioned on earlier segment. This pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks to jointly generate the prediction and planning trajectories. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that Plan-MAE outperforms current methods on the planning metrics by a large margin and can serve as an important pre-training step for learning-based motion planner.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous trucking offers significant benefits, such as improved safety and reduced costs, but faces unique perception challenges due to trucks' large size and dynamic trailer movements. These challenges include extensive blind spots and occlusions that hinder the truck's perception and the capabilities of other road users. To address these limitations, cooperative perception emerges as a promising solution. However, existing datasets predominantly feature light vehicle interactions or lack multi-agent configurations for heavy-duty vehicle scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruckV2X, the first large-scale truck-centered cooperative perception dataset featuring multi-modal sensing (LiDAR and cameras) and multi-agent cooperation (tractors, trailers, CAVs, and RSUs). We further investigate how trucks influence collaborative perception needs, establishing performance benchmarks while suggesting research priorities for heavy vehicle perception. The dataset provides a foundation for developing cooperative perception systems with enhanced occlusion handling capabilities, and accelerates the deployment of multi-agent autonomous trucking systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For precise, efficient, and safe drone landings, ground platforms should real-time, accurately locate descending drones and guide them to designated spots. While mmWave sensing combined with cameras improves localization accuracy, lower sampling frequency of traditional frame cameras compared to mmWave radar creates bottlenecks in system throughput. In this work, we upgrade traditional frame camera with event camera, a novel sensor that harmonizes in sampling frequency with mmWave radar within ground platform setup, and introduce mmE-Loc, a high-precision, low-latency ground localization system designed for precise drone landings. To fully exploit the \textit{temporal consistency} and \textit{spatial complementarity} between these two modalities, we propose two innovative modules: \textit{(i)} the Consistency-instructed Collaborative Tracking module, which further leverages the drone's physical knowledge of periodic micro-motions and structure for accurate measurements extraction, and \textit{(ii)} the Graph-informed Adaptive Joint Optimization module, which integrates drone motion information for efficient sensor fusion and drone localization. Real-world experiments conducted in landing scenarios with a drone delivery company demonstrate that mmE-Loc significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and latency.

  _Anoop Kiran, Nora Ayanian, Kenneth Breuer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flying multiple quadrotors in close proximity presents a significant challenge due to complex aerodynamic interactions, particularly downwash effects that are known to destabilize vehicles and degrade performance. Traditionally, multi-quadrotor systems rely on conservative strategies, such as collision avoidance zones around the robot volume, to circumvent this effect. This restricts their capabilities by requiring a large volume for the operation of a multi-quadrotor system, limiting their applicability in dense environments. This work provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the downwash effect, with a focus on characterizing, analyzing, and understanding forces, moments, and velocities in both single and multi-quadrotor configurations. We use measurements of forces and torques to characterize vehicle interactions, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) to quantify the spatial features of the downwash wake for a single quadrotor and an interacting pair of quadrotors. This data can be used to inform physics-based strategies for coordination, leverage downwash for optimized formations, expand the envelope of operation, and improve the robustness of multi-quadrotor control.

  Motivated by the problem of pursuit-evasion, we present a motion planning framework that combines energy-based diffusion models with artificial potential fields for robust real time trajectory generation in complex environments. Our approach processes obstacle information directly from point clouds, enabling efficient planning without requiring complete geometric representations. The framework employs classifier-free guidance training and integrates local potential fields during sampling to enhance obstacle avoidance. In dynamic scenarios, the system generates initial trajectories using the diffusion model and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation, demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial pursuer observability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning from demonstration has proven effective in robotics for acquiring natural behaviors, such as stylistic motions and lifelike agility, particularly when explicitly defining style-oriented reward functions is challenging. Synthesizing stylistic motions for real-world tasks usually requires balancing task performance and imitation quality. Existing methods generally depend on expert demonstrations closely aligned with task objectives. However, practical demonstrations are often incomplete or unrealistic, causing current methods to boost style at the expense of task performance. To address this issue, we propose formulating the problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Specifically, we optimize a style-imitation objective with constraints to maintain near-optimal task performance. We introduce an adaptively adjustable Lagrangian multiplier to guide the agent to imitate demonstrations selectively, capturing stylistic nuances without compromising task performance. We validate our approach across multiple robotic platforms and tasks, demonstrating both robust task performance and high-fidelity style learning. On ANYmal-D hardware we show a 14.5% drop in mechanical energy and a more agile gait pattern, showcasing real-world benefits.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning, faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space, followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner) framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster community collaboration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimal path planning in nonconvex free spaces is notoriously challenging, as formulating such problems as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) is NP-hard. We propose HZ-MP, an informed Hybrid Zonotope-based Motion Planner, as an alternative approach that decomposes the obstacle-free space and performs low-dimensional face sampling guided by an ellipsotope heuristic, enabling focused exploration along promising transit regions. This structured exploration eliminates the excessive, unreachable sampling that degrades existing informed planners such as AIT* and EIT* in narrow gaps or boxed-goal scenarios. We prove that HZ-MP is probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal. It converges to near-optimal trajectories in finite time and scales to high-dimensional cluttered scenes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving the foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction systems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework for multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or precise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods that require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach introduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle adjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed method constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning from the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while formulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This method effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves outlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration techniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for non-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average translational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2¬∞, with an initial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30¬∞. Moreover, the calibration process operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning. The code is open source and available on GitHub (\underline{this https URL})

  We present a novel approach for the procedural construction of multi-step contact-rich manipulation tasks in robotics. Our generator takes as input user-defined sets of atomic actions, objects, and spatial predicates and outputs solvable tasks of a given length for the selected robotic environment. The generator produces solvable tasks by constraining all possible (nonsolvable) combinations by symbolic and physical validation. The symbolic validation checks each generated sequence for logical and operational consistency, and also the suitability of object-predicate relations. Physical validation checks whether tasks can be solved in the selected robotic environment. Only the tasks that passed both validators are retained. The output from the generator can be directly interfaced with any existing framework for training robotic manipulation tasks, or it can be stored as a dataset of curated robotic tasks with detailed information about each task. This is beneficial for RL training as there are dense reward functions and initial and goal states paired with each subgoal. It allows the user to measure the semantic similarity of all generated tasks. We tested our generator on sequences of up to 15 actions resulting in millions of unique solvable multi-step tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable achievements, driven by the rich implicit knowledge of their vision-language components. However, achieving generalist robotic agents demands precise grounding into physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained force control is essential. We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond identifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real world. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses vision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a hybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into precise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt its strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's effectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling tactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant commonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key finding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic understanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile sensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to achieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) is a sequential decision-making task in which each item must be placed immediately upon arrival, with no knowledge of future arrivals. Although recent deep-reinforcement-learning methods achieve superior volume utilization compared with classical heuristics, the learned policies cannot ensure the structural stability of the bin and lack mechanisms for safely reconfiguring the bin when a new item cannot be placed directly. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates packing policy with structural stability validation and heuristic planning to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we introduce the concept of Load Bearable Convex Polygon (LBCP), which provides a computationally efficient way to identify stable loading positions that guarantee no bin collapse. Additionally, we present Stable Rearrangement Planning (SRP), a module that rearranges existing items to accommodate new ones while maintaining overall stability. Extensive experiments on standard OBPP benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of our LBCP-based stability validation, as well as the superiority of SRP in finding the effort-saving rearrangement plans. Our method offers a robust and practical solution for automated packing in real-world industrial and logistics applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with multi-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and emergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox, dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational sensorimotor learning.I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause. Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.

  High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs). Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings, and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving systems.

  High-precision vectorized maps are indispensable for autonomous driving, yet traditional LiDAR-based creation is costly and slow, while single-vehicle perception methods lack accuracy and robustness, particularly in adverse conditions. This paper introduces EGC-VMAP, an end-to-end framework that overcomes these limitations by generating accurate, city-scale vectorized maps through the aggregation of data from crowdsourced vehicles. Unlike prior approaches, EGC-VMAP directly fuses multi-vehicle, multi-temporal map elements perceived onboard vehicles using a novel Trip-Aware Transformer architecture within a unified learning process. Combined with hierarchical matching for efficient training and a multi-objective loss, our method significantly enhances map accuracy and structural robustness compared to single-vehicle baselines. Validated on a large-scale, multi-city real-world dataset, EGC-VMAP demonstrates superior performance, enabling a scalable, cost-effective solution for city-wide mapping with a reported 90\% reduction in manual annotation costs.

This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase training schedule to train a foundation model -- initially devoid of embodied spatial knowledge -- into a world model that is controllable by motion intentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints.

  Understanding open-world semantics is critical for robotic planning and control, particularly in unstructured outdoor environments. Current vision-language mapping approaches rely on object-centric segmentation priors, which often fail outdoors due to semantic ambiguities and indistinct semantic class boundaries. We propose OTAS - an Open-vocabulary Token Alignment method for Outdoor Segmentation. OTAS overcomes the limitations of open-vocabulary segmentation models by extracting semantic structure directly from the output tokens of pretrained vision models. By clustering semantically similar structures across single and multiple views and grounding them in language, OTAS reconstructs a geometrically consistent feature field that supports open-vocabulary segmentation queries. Our method operates zero-shot, without scene-specific fine-tuning, and runs at up to ~17 fps. OTAS provides a minor IoU improvement over fine-tuned and open-vocabulary 2D segmentation methods on the Off-Road Freespace Detection dataset. Our model achieves up to a 151% IoU improvement over open-vocabulary mapping methods in 3D segmentation on TartanAir. Real-world reconstructions demonstrate OTAS' applicability to robotic applications. The code and ROS node will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

  Visual imitation learning is effective for robots to learn versatile tasks. However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4 leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across 17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods, improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14% (DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success rate by 8.6%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized mobile robots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling their intelligent operation within Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes Constrained Sampling Cluster Model Predictive Path Integral (CSC-MPPI), a novel constrained formulation of MPPI designed to enhance trajectory optimization while enforcing strict constraints on system states and control inputs. Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic sampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates suboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories. To address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual gradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions while mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure that sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual gradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing state and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories, enabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster. Finally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost is chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint satisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that CSC-MPPI outperforms traditional MPPI in obstacle avoidance, achieving improved reliability and efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile robots exploring indoor environments increasingly rely on vision-language models to perceive high-level semantic cues in camera images, such as object categories. Such models offer the potential to substantially advance robot behaviour for tasks such as object-goal navigation (ObjectNav), where the robot must locate objects specified in natural language by exploring the environment. Current ObjectNav methods heavily depend on prompt engineering for perception and do not address the semantic uncertainty induced by variations in prompt phrasing. Ignoring semantic uncertainty can lead to suboptimal exploration, which in turn limits performance. Hence, we propose a semantic uncertainty-informed active perception pipeline for ObjectNav in indoor environments. We introduce a novel probabilistic sensor model for quantifying semantic uncertainty in vision-language models and incorporate it into a probabilistic geometric-semantic map to enhance spatial understanding. Based on this map, we develop a frontier exploration planner with an uncertainty-informed multi-armed bandit objective to guide efficient object search. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves ObjectNav success rates comparable to those of state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring extensive prompt engineering.

  Temporal alignment of multiple signals through time warping is crucial in many fields, such as classification within speech recognition or robot motion learning. Almost all related works are limited to data in Euclidean space. Although an attempt was made in 2011 to adapt this concept to unit quaternions, a general extension to Riemannian manifolds remains absent. Given its importance for numerous applications in robotics and beyond, we introduce Riemannian Time Warping (RTW). This novel approach efficiently aligns multiple signals by considering the geometric structure of the Riemannian manifold in which the data is embedded. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including tests with an LBR iiwa robot, demonstrate that RTW consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both averaging and classification tasks.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in autonomous driving (AD) decision tasks. However, applying RL to urban AD, particularly in intersection scenarios, still faces significant challenges. The lack of safety constraints makes RL vulnerable to risks. Additionally, cognitive limitations and environmental randomness can lead to unreliable decisions in safety-critical scenarios. Therefore, it is essential to quantify confidence in RL decisions to improve safety. This paper proposes an Uncertainty-aware Safety-Critical Decision and Control (USDC) framework, which generates a risk-averse policy by constructing a risk-aware ensemble distributional RL, while estimating uncertainty to quantify the policy's reliability. Subsequently, a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) is employed as a safety filter to minimize intervention policy while dynamically enhancing constraints based on uncertainty. The ensemble critics evaluate both HOCBF and RL policies, embedding uncertainty to achieve dynamic switching between safe and flexible strategies, thereby balancing safety and efficiency. Simulation tests on unsignalized intersections in multiple tasks indicate that USDC can improve safety while maintaining traffic efficiency compared to baselines.

  Robot navigation in dynamic, crowded environments poses a significant challenge due to the inherent uncertainties in the obstacle model. In this work, we propose a risk-adaptive approach based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk Barrier Function (CVaR-BF), where the risk level is automatically adjusted to accept the minimum necessary risk, achieving a good performance in terms of safety and optimization feasibility under uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic zone-based barrier function which characterizes the collision likelihood by evaluating the relative state between the robot and the obstacle. By integrating risk adaptation with this new function, our approach adaptively expands the safety margin, enabling the robot to proactively avoid obstacles in highly dynamic environments. Comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing social navigation approaches, and validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

  Visual augmentation has become a crucial technique for enhancing the visual robustness of imitation learning. However, existing methods are often limited by prerequisites such as camera calibration or the need for controlled environments (e.g., green screen setups). In this work, we introduce RoboEngine, the first plug-and-play visual robot data augmentation toolkit. For the first time, users can effortlessly generate physics- and task-aware robot scenes with just a few lines of code. To achieve this, we present a novel robot scene segmentation dataset, a generalizable high-quality robot segmentation model, and a fine-tuned background generation model, which together form the core components of the out-of-the-box toolkit. Using RoboEngine, we demonstrate the ability to generalize robot manipulation tasks across six entirely new scenes, based solely on demonstrations collected from a single scene, achieving a more than 200% performance improvement compared to the no-augmentation baseline.

  Building robotic prostheses requires a sensor-based interface designed to provide the robotic hand with the control required to perform hand gestures. Traditional Electromyography (EMG) based prosthetics and emerging alternatives often face limitations such as muscle-activation limitations, high cost, and complex calibrations. In this paper, we present a low-cost robotic system composed of a smart ankleband for intuitive, calibration-free control of a robotic hand, and a robotic prosthetic hand that executes actions corresponding to leg gestures. The ankleband integrates an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor with a lightweight neural network to infer user-intended leg gestures from motion data. Our system represents a significant step towards higher adoption rates of robotic prostheses among arm amputees, as it enables one to operate a prosthetic hand using a low-cost, low-power, and calibration-free solution. To evaluate our work, we collected data from 10 subjects and tested our prototype ankleband with a robotic hand on an individual with an upper-limb amputation. Our results demonstrate that this system empowers users to perform daily tasks more efficiently, requiring few compensatory movements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating labor-intensive tasks such as crop monitoring with robots is essential for enhancing production and conserving resources. However, autonomously monitoring horticulture crops remains challenging due to their complex structures, which often result in fruit occlusions. Existing view planning methods attempt to reduce occlusions but either struggle to achieve adequate coverage or incur high robot motion costs. We introduce a global optimization approach for view motion planning that aims to minimize robot motion costs while maximizing fruit coverage. To this end, we leverage coverage constraints derived from the set covering problem (SCP) within a shortest Hamiltonian path problem (SHPP) formulation. While both SCP and SHPP are well-established, their tailored integration enables a unified framework that computes a global view path with minimized motion while ensuring full coverage of selected targets. Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, we employ a region-prior-based selection of coverage targets and a sparse graph structure to achieve effective optimization outcomes within a limited time. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that our method detects more fruits, enhances surface coverage, and achieves higher volume accuracy than the motion-efficient baseline with a moderate increase in motion cost, while significantly reducing motion costs compared to the coverage-focused baseline. Real-world experiments further confirm the practical applicability of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Simulation frameworks are essential for the safe development of robotic applications. However, different components of a robotic system are often best simulated in different environments, making full integration challenging. This is particularly true for partially-open or closed-source simulators, which commonly suffer from two limitations: (i) lack of runtime control over scene actors via interfaces like ROS, and (ii) restricted access to real-time state data (e.g., pose, velocity) of scene objects. In the first part of this work, we address these issues by integrating aerial drones simulated in Parrot's Sphinx environment (used for Anafi drones) into the Gazebo simulator. Our approach uses a mirrored drone instance embedded within Gazebo environments to bridge the two simulators. One key application is aerial target tracking, a common task in multi-robot systems. However, Parrot's default PID-based controller lacks the agility needed for tracking fast-moving targets. To overcome this, in the second part of this work we develop a model predictive controller (MPC) that leverages cumulative error states to improve tracking accuracy. Our MPC significantly outperforms the built-in PID controller in dynamic scenarios, increasing the effectiveness of the overall system. We validate our integrated framework by incorporating the Anafi drone into an existing Gazebo-based airship simulation and rigorously test the MPC against a custom PID baseline in both simulated and real-world experiments.

  Robotic manipulation systems operating in diverse, dynamic environments must exhibit three critical abilities: multitask interaction, generalization to unseen scenarios, and spatial memory. While significant progress has been made in robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization to complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based policy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations from large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average success rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and demonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3% performance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this foundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2, which incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to enhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent tasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial memory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves an average success rate of 94.3% on memory-based tasks in MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and pushing the boundaries of memory-based robotic systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classical manipulator motion planners work across different robot embodiments. However they plan on a pre-specified static environment representation, and are not scalable to unseen dynamic environments. Neural Motion Planners (NMPs) are an appealing alternative to conventional planners as they incorporate different environmental constraints to learn motion policies directly from raw sensor observations. Contemporary state-of-the-art NMPs can successfully plan across different environments. However none of the existing NMPs generalize across robot embodiments. In this paper we propose Cross-Embodiment Motion Policy (XMoP), a neural policy for learning to plan over a distribution of manipulators. XMoP implicitly learns to satisfy kinematic constraints for a distribution of robots and $\textit{zero-shot}$ transfers the planning behavior to unseen robotic manipulators within this distribution. We achieve this generalization by formulating a whole-body control policy that is trained on planning demonstrations from over three million procedurally sampled robotic manipulators in different simulated environments. Despite being completely trained on synthetic embodiments and environments, our policy exhibits strong sim-to-real generalization across manipulators with different kinematic variations and degrees of freedom with a single set of frozen policy parameters. We evaluate XMoP on $7$ commercial manipulators and show successful cross-embodiment motion planning, achieving an average $70\%$ success rate on baseline benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate our policy sim-to-real on two unseen manipulators solving novel planning problems across three real-world domains even with dynamic obstacles.

  Verification and validation of autonomous driving (AD) systems and components is of increasing importance, as such technology increases in real-world prevalence. Safety-critical scenario generation is a key approach to robustify AD policies through closed-loop training. However, existing approaches for scenario generation rely on simplistic objectives, resulting in overly-aggressive or non-reactive adversarial behaviors. To generate diverse adversarial yet realistic scenarios, we propose SEAL, a scenario perturbation approach which leverages learned objective functions and adversarial, human-like skills. SEAL-perturbed scenarios are more realistic than SOTA baselines, leading to improved ego task success across real-world, in-distribution, and out-of-distribution scenarios, of more than 20%.

  Articulated objects are ubiquitous in daily life. In this paper, we present DexSim2Real$^{2}$, a novel framework for goal-conditioned articulated object manipulation. The core of our framework is constructing an explicit world model of unseen articulated objects through active interactions, which enables sampling-based model predictive control to plan trajectories achieving different goals without requiring demonstrations or RL. It first predicts an interaction using an affordance network trained on self-supervised interaction data or videos of human manipulation. After executing the interactions on the real robot to move the object parts, we propose a novel modeling pipeline based on 3D AIGC to build a digital twin of the object in simulation from multiple frames of observations. For dexterous hands, we utilize eigengrasp to reduce the action dimension, enabling more efficient trajectory searching. Experiments validate the framework's effectiveness for precise manipulation using a suction gripper, a two-finger gripper and two dexterous hand. The generalizability of the explicit world model also enables advanced manipulation strategies like manipulating with tools.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Localization using a single range anchor combined with onboard optical-inertial odometry offers a lightweight solution that provides multidimensional measurements for the positioning of unmanned aerial vehicles. Unfortunately, the performance of such lightweight sensors varies with the dynamic environment, and the fidelity of the dynamic model is also severely affected by environmental aerial flow. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive sliding window estimator equipped with an estimation reliability evaluator, where the states, noise covariance matrices and aerial drag are estimated simultaneously. The aerial drag effects are first evaluated based on posterior states and covariance. Then, an augmented Kalman filter is designed to pre-process multidimensional measurements and inherit historical information. Subsequently, an inverse-Wishart smoother is employed to estimate posterior states and covariance matrices. To further suppress potential divergence, a reliability evaluator is devised to infer estimation errors. We further determine the fidelity of each sensor based on the error propagation. Extensive experiments are conducted in both standard and harsh environments, demonstrating the adaptability and robustness of the proposed method. The root mean square error reaches 0.15 m, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach. Real-world close-loop control experiments are additionally performed to verify the estimator's competence in practical application.

  The ICP registration algorithm has been a preferred method for LiDAR-based robot localization for nearly a decade. However, even in modern SLAM solutions, ICP can degrade and become unreliable in geometrically ill-conditioned environments. Current solutions primarily focus on utilizing additional sources of information, such as external odometry, to either replace the degenerate directions of the optimization solution or add additional constraints in a sensor-fusion setup afterward.In response, this work investigates and compares new and existing degeneracy mitigation methods for robust LiDAR-based localization and analyzes the efficacy of these approaches in degenerate environments for the first time in the literature at this scale. Specifically, this work investigates i) the effect of using active or passive degeneracy mitigation methods for the problem of ill-conditioned ICP in LiDAR degenerate environments, ii) the evaluation of TSVD, inequality constraints, and linear/non-linear Tikhonov regularization for the application of degenerate point cloud registration for the first time. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for least-squares minimization step of the ICP problem is carried out to better understand how each method affects the optimization and what to expect from each method. The results of the analysis are validated through multiple real-world robotic field and simulated experiments. The analysis demonstrates that active optimization degeneracy mitigation is necessary and advantageous in the absence of reliable external estimate assistance for LiDAR-SLAM, and soft-constrained methods can provide better results in complex ill-conditioned scenarios with heuristic fine-tuned parameters.

  Dynamic jumping on high platforms and over gaps differentiates legged robots from wheeled counterparts. Dynamic locomotion on abrupt surfaces, as opposed to walking on rough terrains, demands the integration of proprioceptive and exteroceptive perception to enable explosive movements. In this paper, we propose SF-TIM (Simple Framework combining Terrain Imagination and Measurement), a single-policy method that enhances quadrupedal robot jumping agility, while preserving their fundamental blind walking capabilities. In addition, we introduce a terrain-guided reward design specifically to assist quadrupedal robots in high jumping, improving their performance in this task. To narrow the simulation-to-reality gap in quadrupedal robot learning, we introduce a stable and high-speed elevation map generation framework, enabling zero-shot simulation-to-reality transfer of locomotion ability. Our algorithm has been deployed and validated on both the small-/large-size quadrupedal robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications: the robot has successfully traversed various high platforms and gaps, showing the robustness of our proposed approach.

  Payload transport over flat terrain via multi-wheel robot carriers is well-understood, highly effective, and configurable. In this paper, our goal is to provide similar effectiveness and configurability for transport over rough terrain that is more suitable for legs rather than wheels. For this purpose, we consider multi-biped robot carriers, where wheels are replaced by multiple bipedal robots attached to the carrier. Our main contribution is to design a decentralized controller for such systems that can be effectively applied to varying numbers and configurations of rigidly attached bipedal robots without retraining. We present a reinforcement learning approach for training the controller in simulation that supports transfer to the real world. Our experiments in simulation provide quantitative metrics showing the effectiveness of the approach over a wide variety of simulated transport scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate the controller in the real-world for systems composed of two and three Cassie robots. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a scalable multi-biped payload transport system.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning has emerged as an important approach for autonomous driving. A reward function is used in reinforcement learning to establish the learned skill objectives and guide the agent toward the optimal policy. Since autonomous driving is a complex domain with partly conflicting objectives with varying degrees of priority, developing a suitable reward function represents a fundamental challenge. This paper aims to highlight the gap in such function design by assessing different proposed formulations in the literature and dividing individual objectives into Safety, Comfort, Progress, and Traffic Rules compliance categories. Additionally, the limitations of the reviewed reward functions are discussed, such as objectives aggregation and indifference to driving context. Furthermore, the reward categories are frequently inadequately formulated and lack standardization. This paper concludes by proposing future research that potentially addresses the observed shortcomings in rewards, including a reward validation framework and structured rewards that are context-aware and able to resolve conflicts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a fast and accurate model of a deformable linear object (DLO) -- e.g., a rope, wire, or cable -- integrated into an established robot physics simulator, MuJoCo. Most accurate DLO models with low computational times exist in standalone numerical simulators, which are unable or require tedious work to handle external objects. Based on an existing state-of-the-art DLO model -- Discrete Elastic Rods (DER) -- our implementation provides an improvement in accuracy over MuJoCo's own native cable model. To minimize computational load, our model utilizes force-lever analysis to adapt the Cartesian stiffness forces of the DER into its generalized coordinates. As a key contribution, we introduce a novel parameter identification pipeline designed for both simplicity and accuracy, which we utilize to determine the bending and twisting stiffness of three distinct DLOs. We then evaluate the performance of each model by simulating the DLOs and comparing them to their real-world counterparts and against theoretically proven validation tests.

Moreover, CoDe is specifically tailored for UAV's operations by addressing the challenges faced by existing schemes, such as ineffectiveness in selecting actions from continuous action spaces and high computational complexity. CoDe is based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), and finds cooperative policies by incorporating a novel credit assignment scheme. The novel credit assignment scheme estimates the contribution of an individual by subtracting a baseline from the joint action value for the swarm. The credit assignment scheme in CoDe outperforms other benchmarks as the baseline takes into account not only the importance of a UAV's action but also the interrelation between UAVs. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted against existing MARL-based and conventional heuristic-based algorithms to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.
