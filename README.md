- **[Identifiability in Causal Abstractions: A Hierarchy of Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06213)**  `arXiv:2507.06213`  
  _Cl√©ment Yvernes, Emilie Devijver, Marianne Clausel, Eric Gaussier_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings. To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information. In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal knowledge is unavailable.

- **[The Delta Learning Hypothesis: Preference Tuning on Weak Data can Yield Strong Gains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06187)**  `arXiv:2507.06187`  
  _Scott Geng, Hamish Ivison, Chun-Liang Li, Maarten Sap, Jerry Li, Ranjay Krishna, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard 11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be considered weak.

  _Sanidhya Vijayvargiya, Aditya Bharat Soni, Xuhui Zhou, Zora Zhiruo Wang, Nouha Dziri, Graham Neubig, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings, but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories. Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites, and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors. Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7% with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

- **[AI-Based Demand Forecasting and Load Balancing for Optimising Energy use in Healthcare Systems: A real case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06077)**  `arXiv:2507.06077`  
  _Iman Rahimi, Isha Patel_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate, causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm (GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE: 87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies, enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall, the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

- **[FEVO: Financial Knowledge Expansion and Reasoning Evolution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06057)**  `arXiv:2507.06057`  
  _Bo Pang, Yalu Ouyang, Hangfei Xu, Ziqi Jia, Panpan Li, Shengzhao Wen, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO (Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

- **[On Lockean beliefs that are deductively closed and minimal change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06042)**  `arXiv:2507.06042`  
  _Tommaso Flaminio, Lluis Godo, Ram√≥n Pino P√©rez, Lluis Subirana_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set via a minimal revision.

- **[Feature-Guided Neighbor Selection for Non-Expert Evaluation of Model Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06029)**  `arXiv:2507.06029`  
  _Courtney Ford, Mark T. Keane_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications, FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

  _Kushal Gajjar, Harshit Sikchi, Arpit Singh Gautam, Marc Hammons, Saurabh Jha_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access. Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench, outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs (40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of 5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

- **[A Wireless Foundation Model for Multi-Task Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05938)**  `arXiv:2507.05938`  
  _Yucheng Sheng, Jiacheng Wang, Xingyu Zhou, Le Liang, Hao Ye, Shi Jin, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency. All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful insights to the research community.

  _Fathinah Izzati, Xinyue Li, Yuxuan Wu, Gus Xia_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music, envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow, melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g. MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI), which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from text.

- **[Decomposing the Time Series Forecasting Pipeline: A Modular Approach for Time Series Representation, Information Extraction, and Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05891)**  `arXiv:2507.05891`  
  _Robert Leppich, Michael Stenger, Andr√© Bauer, Samuel Kounev_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages: input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction, and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules, such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks, including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter count.

  _Alo√Øs Rautureau, √âric Piette_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

- **[GTA1: GUI Test-time Scaling Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05791)**  `arXiv:2507.05791`  
  _Yan Yang, Dongxu Li, Yutong Dai, Yuhao Yang, Ziyang Luo, Zirui Zhao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms (e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements. Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step. However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning (i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual targets.This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments, rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7% accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

- **[Real-time monitoring of the SoH of lithium-ion batteries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05765)**  `arXiv:2507.05765`  
  _Bruno Jammes, Edgar Hernando Sep√∫lveda-Oviedo, Corinne Alonso_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far, the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries, cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1% in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9. If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery management under continuous operation.

- **[An autonomous agent for auditing and improving the reliability of clinical AI models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05755)**  `arXiv:2507.05755`  
  _Lukas Kuhn, Florian Buettner_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge: models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging. Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy, but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes. Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent, clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover 15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods. These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

- **[Divergent Realities: A Comparative Analysis of Human Expert vs. Artificial Intelligence Based Generation and Evaluation of Treatment Plans in Dermatology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05716)**  `arXiv:2507.05716`  
  _Dipayan Sengupta, Saumya Panda_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI (o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical rubric.Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16; p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th (mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration, suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP). However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data (TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions. Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics.

  _Yuan An, John Liu, Niyam Acharya, Ruhma Hashmi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However, generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing them to students.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of artificial intelligence. We argue that formalising measurement for AI will allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization, and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+ (90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation, fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and physiological prediction tasks. Code base:this http URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have advanced virtual educators and learners, bridging NLP with AI4Education. Existing work often lacks scalability and fails to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics. Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.

  The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2) introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability. By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training, featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models, including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

  Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web, analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge, particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report. Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various large language models to transform them into deep research agents for evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on three deep research agents.

  _Yue Wang, Miao Zhou, Guijing Huang, Rui Zhuo, Chao Yi, Zhenliang Ma_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT) results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS) software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan. Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300 plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers, serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile application of LLMs in the field of ITS.

  While the game Connect-Four has been solved mathematically and the best move can be effectively computed with search based methods, a strong solution in the form of a look-up table was believed to be infeasible. In this paper, we revisit a symbolic search method based on binary decision diagrams to produce strong solutions. With our efficient implementation we were able to produce a 89.6 GB large look-up table in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB main memory for the standard $7 \times 6$ board size. In addition to this win-draw-loss evaluation, we include an alpha-beta search in our open source artifact to find the move which achieves the fastest win or slowest loss.

  The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such, Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters, sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy. Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text, significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks, MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering, 15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8% improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP. MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts. Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments, this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution, derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets, while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:this https URL

  LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.

Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated and expert evaluations.

  This paper investigates the impact of ILP techniques on BnB MaxSAT solvers, particularly ILP preprocessing techniques and various portfolio strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that ILP techniques enable WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200 and MaxCDCL-OpenWbo300, the best two solvers in the unweighted track of the MaxSAT evaluation 2024, to solve 27 and 30 additional instances, respectively. Furthermore, although state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers heavily rely on an ILP solver in their portfolios, our proposed approach uses ILP preprocessing techniques to reduce this dependency. Allocating only a short runtime to the ILP solver within a portfolio that includes (W)MaxCDCL, as proposed in our approach, is sufficient to achieve strong results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

  Large Language Model based multi-agent systems are revolutionizing autonomous communication and collaboration, yet they remain vulnerable to security threats like unauthorized access and data breaches. To address this, we introduce AgentSafe, a novel framework that enhances MAS security through hierarchical information management and memory protection. AgentSafe classifies information by security levels, restricting sensitive data access to authorized agents. AgentSafe incorporates two components: ThreatSieve, which secures communication by verifying information authority and preventing impersonation, and HierarCache, an adaptive memory management system that defends against unauthorized access and malicious poisoning, representing the first systematic defense for agent memory. Experiments across various LLMs show that AgentSafe significantly boosts system resilience, achieving defense success rates above 80% under adversarial conditions. Additionally, AgentSafe demonstrates scalability, maintaining robust performance as agent numbers and information complexity grow. Results underscore effectiveness of AgentSafe in securing MAS and its potential for real-world application.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable emergent capabilities, transforming the execution of functional tasks by leveraging external tools for complex problems that require specialized processing or up-to-date data. While existing research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program interpreters, search engines, calculators), the necessity of using these tools is often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This naive approach raises two key issues: increased latency due to unnecessary tool calls, and potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with external tools. In this paper, we introduce meta-cognition as a proxy for LLMs self-assessment of their capabilities, reflecting the model's awareness of its own limitations. Based on this, we propose MeCo, an adaptive decision-making strategy for external tool use. MeCo quantifies metacognitive scores by capturing high-level cognitive signals in the representation space, guiding when to invoke tools. Notably, MeCo is fine-tuning-free and incurs minimal cost. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks show that MeCo reliably detects LLMs' internal cognitive signals and significantly improves tool-use decision-making.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in AI regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. In this work we show that \textit{agents might be all we need for effective and practical inference-time LLM unlearning}. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (\texttt{ALU}) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our \texttt{ALU} framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and \texttt{ALU} seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that \texttt{ALU} consistently stands out as the most robust inference-time LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring time cost that remains effectively constant regardless of the number of unlearning targets. We further highlight \texttt{ALU}'s superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, \texttt{ALU} is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM-as-a-Judge models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences intended to capture the step-bystep reasoning process that underlies the final evaluation of a response. However, due to the lack of human annotated CoTs for evaluation, the required components and structure of effective reasoning traces remain understudied. Consequently, previous approaches often (1) constrain reasoning traces to hand-designed components, such as a list of criteria, reference answers, or verification questions and (2) structure them such that planning is intertwined with the reasoning for evaluation. In this work, we propose EvalPlanner, a preference optimization algorithm for Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge that first generates an unconstrained evaluation plan, followed by its execution, and then the final judgment. In a self-training loop, EvalPlanner iteratively optimizes over synthetically constructed evaluation plans and executions, leading to better final verdicts. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for generative reward models on RewardBench (with a score of 93.9), despite being trained on fewer amount of, and synthetically generated, preference pairs. Additional experiments on other benchmarks like RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval further highlight the utility of both planning and reasoning for building robust LLM-as-a-Judge reasoning models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning tasks, yet their reliance on static prompt structures and limited adaptability to complex scenarios remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose the Deductive and InDuctive(DID) method, a novel framework that enhances LLM reasoning by dynamically integrating both deductive and inductive reasoning approaches. Drawing from cognitive science principles, DID implements a dual-metric complexity evaluation system that combines Littlestone dimension and information entropy to precisely assess task difficulty and guide decomposition strategies. DID enables the model to progressively adapt its reasoning pathways based on problem complexity, mirroring human cognitive processes. We evaluate DID's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including the AIW and MR-GSM8K, as well as our custom Holiday Puzzle dataset for temporal reasoning. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in reasoning quality and solution accuracy - achieving 70.3% accuracy on AIW (compared to 62.2% for Tree of Thought) while maintaining lower computational costs. The success of DID in improving LLM performance while preserving computational efficiency suggests promising directions for developing more cognitively aligned and capable language models. Our work contributes a theoretically grounded, input-centric approach to enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, offering an efficient alternative to traditional output-exploration methods.

  This paper continues an established line of research about the relations between argumentation theory, particularly assumption-based argumentation, and different kinds of logic programs. In particular, we extend known result of Caminada, Schultz and Toni by showing that assumption-based argumentation can represent not only normal logic programs, but also disjunctive logic programs and their extensions. For this, we consider some inference rules for disjunction that the core logic of the argumentation frameworks should respect, and show the correspondence to the handling of disjunctions in the heads of the logic programs' rules.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3 improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

  _Zhiyuan Peng, Ting-ruen Wei, Tingyu Song, Yilun Zhao, Yi Fang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens. However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size, making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning, highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations. Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the frontier of LLM cognition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Numerical claims, statements involving quantities, comparisons, and temporal references, pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking systems. In this study, we evaluate modeling strategies for veracity prediction of such claims using the QuanTemp dataset and building our own evidence retrieval pipeline. We investigate three key factors: (1) the impact of more evidences with longer input context windows using ModernBERT, (2) the effect of right-to-left (R2L) tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance. Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4 submissions in Task 3 of CheckThat! 2025. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025. We investigate the effectiveness of transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness, especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us $16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation for improved subjectivity detection. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench, a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal mathematical reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model (VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens, which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training. Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities. Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation, and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential direction for developing more powerful coding models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG. NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG. Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably, NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

  This survey reviews prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for adapting language models by prepending trainable continuous vectors while keeping the model frozen. We classify existing approaches into two categories: direct prompt learning and transfer learning. Direct prompt learning methods include: general optimization approaches, encoder-based methods, decomposition strategies, and mixture-of-experts frameworks. Transfer learning methods consist of: general transfer approaches, encoder-based methods, and decomposition strategies. For each method, we analyze method designs, innovations, insights, advantages, and disadvantages, with illustrative visualizations comparing different frameworks. We identify challenges in computational efficiency and training stability, and discuss future directions in improving training robustness and broadening application scope.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models, we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference (DI).

  Embodied agents performing complex tasks are susceptible to execution failures, motivating the need for effective failure recovery mechanisms. In this work, we introduce a conditional multistage failure recovery framework that employs zero-shot chain prompting. The framework is structured into four error-handling stages, with three operating during task execution and one functioning as a post-execution reflection phase. Our approach utilises the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to analyse execution challenges within their environmental context and devise strategic solutions. We evaluate our method on the TfD benchmark of the TEACH dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming a baseline without error recovery by 11.5% and surpassing the strongest existing model by 19%.

  Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$ Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large language models.

  A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used for modelthis http URLmethod significantly reduces training costs by eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues, we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data. Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data. Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the model are greatly reduced.

  Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label - semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments. The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and evaluation code are publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments. OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective evaluation, and is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality, especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly available

  Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years. For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a constant blind spot.We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection. To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation, metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

A central phenomenon in this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions, the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion. Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed. Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence among these models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding, without compromising base performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering" strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world deployments.In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns. We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and comparison.

  Current long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) models excel at mathematical reasoning but rely on slow and error-prone natural language traces. Tool-augmented agents address arithmetic via code execution, but often falter on complex logical tasks. We introduce a fine-tuning framework, DualDistill, that distills complementary reasoning strategies from multiple teachers into a unified student model. Using this approach, we train Agentic-R1, which dynamically selects the optimal strategy for each query, invoking tools for arithmetic and algorithmic problems, and using text-based reasoning for abstract ones. Our method improves accuracy across a range of tasks, including both computation-intensive and standard benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy distillation in achieving robust and efficient reasoning.

  Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit language confusion, a tendency to generate responses in a dominant language irrespective of the prompt's language. To address this, we propose Smoothie-Qwen, a lightweight, post-hoc method that mitigates language bias without retraining. This technique selectively adjusts token-level output probabilities to effectively suppress undesired language generation. Applied to the Qwen model, our method reduces unintended Chinese output by over 95% while preserving task accuracy on multilingual benchmarks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for enhancing the language controllability of LLMs, making them more reliable for global applications.

  _Mingzhe Li, Jing Xiang, Qishen Zhang, Kaiyang Wan, Xiuying Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach. The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs) adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models. However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation, and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning, enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external supervision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling, leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT) training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16% using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations, enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

  Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios. State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API, GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS, which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling for inclusive content moderation.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic capabilities of LLMs.

  Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2) learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages, rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations, comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

  Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK) across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English, Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding. We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting, in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual grounding and reduces hallucination.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language. Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics. Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.this https URL

  Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges, highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with user-defined privacy preferences.

  Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap, we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers, reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift, models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers, highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

  We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought (CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs. We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal easier to optimize.

  Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS, a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover, LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields. Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content, including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1 improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

  _Sougata Saha, Monojit Choudhury_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative. We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement, especially Llama.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an 11-23% improvement in accuracy.

Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context, requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning. MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation for continual learning and personalized modeling.

  In this paper, we explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to plan and make decisions through the lens of the traditional Vietnamese board game, √î ƒÇn Quan. This game, which involves a series of strategic token movements and captures, offers a unique environment for evaluating the decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the √î ƒÇn Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across different strategies. Through experimentation with models like Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy, contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal, multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs' knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that (i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap. Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can offer insights and contributions to the community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be increasingly applied across various domains, their widespread adoption necessitates rigorous monitoring to prevent unintended negative consequences and ensure robustness. Furthermore, LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks, activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user expectations.

  In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with an RL-based dialogue manager for open-ended dialogue with a specific goal. By leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to model the structured phases of dialogue and employ meta-learning to enhance adaptability across diverse user profiles, our approach enhances adaptability and efficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly between dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient needs. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster behavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit of conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central challenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting (InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions. Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both traditional prompting and latent steering.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models are trained mainly on massive text data from the Internet, and it becomes increasingly important to understand this data source. Exact-match search engines enable searching in large text corpora -- counting string appearances and retrieving the enclosing documents -- yet the high storage overhead hinders their application on Internet-scale data. We present Infini-gram mini, an efficient and scalable system that can make petabyte-level text corpora searchable. Based on the FM-index data structure (Ferragina and Manzini, 2000), which simultaneously indexes and compresses text, our system creates indexes with size only 44% of the corpus. Infini-gram mini greatly improves upon the best existing implementation of FM-index in terms of indexing speed (18$\times$) and memory use during both indexing (3.2$\times$ reduction) and querying (down to a negligible amount). We index 46TB of Internet text in 50 days with a single 128-core CPU node (or 19 hours if using 75 such nodes). We show one important use case of Infini-gram mini in a large-scale analysis of benchmark contamination. We find several core LM evaluation benchmarks to be heavily contaminated in Internet crawls (up to 40% in SQuAD), which could lead to overestimating the capabilities of language models if trained on such data. We host a benchmark contamination bulletin to share the contamination rate of many core and community-contributed benchmarks. We also release a web interface and an API endpoint to serve general search queries on Infini-gram mini indexes.

  _Qinggang Zhang, Zhishang Xiang, Yilin Xiao, Le Wang, Junhui Li, Xinrun Wang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context. Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is available atthis https URL

Social media platforms like Reddit offer valuable, yet underexplored, information for such high-frequency, short-term trading. This paper introduces \textbf{PulseReddit}, a novel dataset that is the first to align large-scale Reddit discussion data with high-frequency cryptocurrency market statistics for short-term trading analysis. We conduct an extensive empirical study using Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to investigate the impact of social sentiment from PulseReddit on trading performance. Our experiments conclude that MAS augmented with PulseReddit data achieve superior trading outcomes compared to traditional baselines, particularly in bull markets, and demonstrate robust adaptability across different market regimes. Furthermore, our research provides conclusive insights into the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different LLMs, detailing significant considerations for practical model selection in HFT applications. PulseReddit and our findings establish a foundation for advanced MAS research in HFT, demonstrating the tangible benefits of integrating social media.

  Recent advancements in adversarial jailbreak attacks have revealed significant vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), facilitating the evasion of alignment safeguards through increasingly sophisticated prompt manipulations. In this paper, we propose MEF, a capability-aware multi-encryption framework for evaluating vulnerabilities in black-box LLMs. Our key insight is that the effectiveness of jailbreak strategies can be significantly enhanced by tailoring them to the semantic comprehension capabilities of the target model. We present a typology that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II based on their comprehension levels, and design adaptive attack strategies for each. MEF combines layered semantic mutations and dual-ended encryption techniques, enabling circumvention of input, inference, and output-level defenses. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, it achieves a jailbreak success rate of 98.9\% on GPT-4o (29 May 2025 release). Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in current LLMs' alignment defenses.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their remarkable success and deployment across diverse workflows, language models sometimes produce untruthful responses. Our limited understanding of how truthfulness is mechanistically encoded within these models jeopardizes their reliability and safety. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying representations of truthfulness at the neuron level. We show that language models contain truth neurons, which encode truthfulness in a subject-agnostic manner. Experiments conducted across models of varying scales validate the existence of truth neurons, confirming that the encoding of truthfulness at the neuron level is a property shared by many language models. The distribution patterns of truth neurons over layers align with prior findings on the geometry of truthfulness. Selectively suppressing the activations of truth neurons found through the TruthfulQA dataset degrades performance both on TruthfulQA and on other benchmarks, showing that the truthfulness mechanisms are not tied to a specific dataset. Our results offer novel insights into the mechanisms underlying truthfulness in language models and highlight potential directions toward improving their trustworthiness and reliability.

  The automation of scientific research through large language models (LLMs) presents significant opportunities but faces critical challenges in knowledge synthesis and quality assurance. We introduce Feedback-Refined Agent Methodology (FRAME), a novel framework that enhances medical paper generation through iterative refinement and structured feedback. Our approach comprises three key innovations: (1) A structured dataset construction method that decomposes 4,287 medical papers into essential research components through iterative refinement; (2) A tripartite architecture integrating Generator, Evaluator, and Reflector agents that progressively improve content quality through metric-driven feedback; and (3) A comprehensive evaluation framework that combines statistical metrics with human-grounded benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate FRAME's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements over conventional approaches across multiple models (9.91% average gain with DeepSeek V3, comparable improvements with GPT-4o Mini) and evaluation dimensions. Human evaluation confirms that FRAME-generated papers achieve quality comparable to human-authored works, with particular strength in synthesizing future research directions. The results demonstrated our work could efficiently assist medical research by building a robust foundation for automated medical research paper generation while maintaining rigorous academic standards.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative language modelling has surged in popularity with the emergence of services such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. While these models have demonstrated transformative potential in productivity and communication, they overwhelmingly cater to high-resource languages like English. This has amplified concerns over linguistic inequality in natural language processing (NLP). This paper presents the first systematic review focused specifically on strategies to address data scarcity in generative language modelling for low-resource languages (LRL). Drawing from 54 studies, we identify, categorise and evaluate technical approaches, including monolingual data augmentation, back-translation, multilingual training, and prompt engineering, across generative tasks. We also analyse trends in architecture choices, language family representation, and evaluation methods. Our findings highlight a strong reliance on transformer-based models, a concentration on a small subset of LRLs, and a lack of consistent evaluation across studies. We conclude with recommendations for extending these methods to a wider range of LRLs and outline open challenges in building equitable generative language systems. Ultimately, this review aims to support researchers and developers in building inclusive AI tools for underrepresented languages, a necessary step toward empowering LRL speakers and the preservation of linguistic diversity in a world increasingly shaped by large-scale language technologies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agentic AI workflows (systems that autonomously plan and act) are becoming widespread, yet their task success rate on complex tasks remains low. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which uses extra compute at test time to improve performance. Inference-time alignment relies on three components: sampling, evaluation, and feedback. While most prior work studies sampling and automatic evaluation, feedback remains underexplored. To study the role of feedback, we introduce Iterative Agent Decoding (IAD), a procedure that repeatedly inserts feedback extracted from different forms of critiques (reward models or AI-generated textual feedback) between decoding steps. Through IAD, we analyze feedback along four dimensions: (1) its role in the accuracy-compute trade-offs with limited inference budget, (2) quantifying the gains over diversity-only baselines such as best-of-N sampling, (3) effectiveness of composing feedback from reward models versus textual critique, and (4) robustness to noisy or low-quality feedback. Across Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, Intercode, and WebShop, we show that IAD with proper integration of high fidelity feedback leads to consistent gains up to 10 percent absolute performance improvement over various baselines such as best-of-N. Our findings underscore feedback as a crucial knob for inference-time alignment of agentic AI workflows with limited inference budget.

  Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer have been widely applied in the filed of natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating strong performance, particularly in handling short text tasks. However, when it comes to long context scenarios, the performance of LLMs degrades due to some challenges. To alleviate this phenomenon, there is a number of work proposed recently. In this survey, we first list the challenges of applying pre-trained LLMs to process long contexts. Then systematically review the approaches related to long context and propose our taxonomy categorizing them into four main types: positional encoding, context compression, retrieval augmented, and attention pattern. In addition to the approaches, we focus on the evaluation of long context, organizing relevant data, tasks, and metrics based on existing long context benchmarks. Finally, we summarize unresolved issues in the long context domain and put forward our views on future developments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Integrating structured graph data with rich textual information from nodes poses a significant challenge, particularly for heterophilic node classification. Current approaches often struggle with computational costs or effective fusion of disparate modalities. We propose \textbf{Graph Masked Language Model (GMLM)}, a novel architecture efficiently combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). GMLM introduces three key innovations: (i) a \textbf{dynamic active node selection} strategy for scalable PLM text processing; (ii) a GNN-specific \textbf{contrastive pretraining stage} using soft masking with a learnable graph \texttt{[MASK]} token for robust structural representations; and (iii) a \textbf{dedicated fusion module} integrating RGCN-based GNN embeddings with PLM (GTE-Small \& DistilBERT) embeddings. Extensive experiments on heterophilic benchmarks (Cornell, Wisconsin, Texas) demonstrate GMLM's superiority. Notably, GMLM(DistilBERT) achieves significant performance gains, improving accuracy by over \textbf{4.7\%} on Cornell and over \textbf{2.0\%} on Texas compared to the previous best-performing baselines. This work underscores the benefits of targeted PLM engagement and modality-specific pretraining for improved, efficient learning on text-rich graphs.

  Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination stemming from misaligned self-awareness, particularly when processing queries exceeding their knowledge boundaries. While existing mitigation strategies employ uncertainty estimation or query rejection mechanisms, they suffer from computational efficiency and sacrificed helpfulness. To address these issues, we propose the Explicit Knowledge Boundary Modeling (EKBM) framework, integrating fast and slow reasoning systems to harmonize reliability and usability. The framework first employs a fast-thinking model to generate confidence-labeled responses, enabling immediate utilization of high-confidence outputs, whereas uncertain predictions trigger a slow refinement model for accuracy improvement. To align model behavior with our proposed object, we propose a hybrid training pipeline, enhancing self-awareness without degrading task performance. Evaluations on dialogue state tracking tasks demonstrate that EKBM achieves superior model reliability over uncertainty-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that refinement substantially boosts accuracy while maintaining low computational overhead. The framework establishes a scalable paradigm for deploying reliable LLMs in error-sensitive applications, effectively balancing accuracy and practical utility.

  Mathematical formulas are a fundamental and widely used component in various scientific fields, serving as a universal language for expressing complex concepts and relationships. While state-of-the-art transformer models excel in processing and understanding natural language, they encounter challenges with mathematical notation, which involves a complex structure and diverse representations. This study focuses on the development of specialized training datasets to enhance the encoding of mathematical content. We introduce Math Mutator (MAMUT), a framework capable of generating equivalent and falsified versions of a given mathematical formula in LaTeX notation, effectively capturing the mathematical variety in notation of the same concept. Based on MAMUT, we have generated four large mathematical datasets containing diverse notation. Experiments show that models trained on these datasets exhibit new SoTA performance on mathematical retrieval tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quality estimation is omnipresent in machine translation, for both evaluation and generation. Unfortunately, quality estimation models are often opaque and computationally expensive, making them impractical to be part of large-scale pipelines. In this work, we tackle two connected challenges: (1) reducing the cost of quality estimation at scale, and (2) developing an inexpensive uncertainty estimation method for quality estimation. To address the latter, we introduce Instant Confidence COMET, an uncertainty-aware quality estimation model that matches the performance of previous approaches at a fraction of their costs. We extend this to Early-Exit COMET, a quality estimation model that can compute quality scores and associated confidences already at early model layers, allowing us to early-exit computations and reduce evaluation costs. We also apply our model to machine translation reranking. We combine Early-Exit COMET with an upper confidence bound bandit algorithm to find the best candidate from a large pool without having to run the full evaluation model on all candidates. In both cases (evaluation and reranking) our methods reduce the required compute by 50% with very little degradation in performance. Finally, we show how Instant Confidence COMET can be used to decide which translations a human evaluator should score rather than relying on the COMET score.

  Non-autoregressive (NAR) generative models are valuable because they can handle diverse conditional generation tasks in a more principled way than their autoregressive (AR) counterparts, which are constrained by sequential dependency requirements. Recent advancements in NAR models, such as diffusion language models, have demonstrated superior performance in unconditional generation compared to AR models (e.g., GPTs) of similar sizes. However, such improvements do not always lead to improved conditional generation performance. We show that a key reason for this gap is the difficulty in generalizing to conditional probability queries (i.e., the set of unknown variables) unseen during training. As a result, strong unconditional generation performance does not guarantee high-quality conditional generation. This paper proposes Tractable Transformers (Tracformer), a Transformer-based generative model that is more robust to different conditional generation tasks. Unlike existing models that rely solely on global contextual features derived from full inputs, Tracformers incorporate a sparse Transformer encoder to capture both local and global contextual information. This information is routed through a decoder for conditional generation. Empirical results demonstrate that Tracformers achieve state-of-the-art conditional generation performance on text modeling compared to recent diffusion and AR model baselines.

  _Shuo Wang, Issei Sato_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Induction head mechanism is a part of the computational circuits for in-context learning (ICL) that enable large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks without fine-tuning. Most existing work explains the training dynamics behind acquiring such a powerful mechanism. However, the model's ability to coordinate in-context information over long contexts and global knowledge acquired during pretraining remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how a two-layer transformer thoroughly captures in-context information and balances it with pretrained bigram knowledge in next token prediction, from the viewpoint of associative memory. We theoretically analyze the representation of weight matrices in attention layers and the resulting logits when a transformer is given prompts generated by a bigram model. In the experiments, we design specific prompts to evaluate whether the outputs of the trained transformer align with the theoretical results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many existing evaluation benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) quickly become outdated due to the emergence of new models and training data. These benchmarks also fall short in assessing how LLM performance changes over time, as they consist of a static set of questions without a temporal dimension. To address these limitations, we propose using future event prediction as a continuous evaluation method to assess LLMs' temporal generalization and forecasting abilities. Our benchmark, Daily Oracle, automatically generates question-answer (QA) pairs from daily news, challenging LLMs to predict "future" event outcomes. Our findings reveal that as pre-training data becomes outdated, LLM performance degrades over time. While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy, the performance degradation pattern persists, highlighting the need for continuous model updates.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Researchers in social science and psychology have recently proposed using large language models (LLMs) as replacements for humans in behavioral research. In addition to arguments about whether LLMs accurately capture population-level patterns, this has raised questions about whether LLMs capture human-like conceptual diversity. Separately, it is debated whether post-training alignment (RLHF or RLAIF) affects models' internal diversity. Inspired by human studies, we use a new way of measuring the conceptual diversity of synthetically-generated LLM "populations" by relating the internal variability of simulated individuals to the population-level variability. We use this approach to evaluate non-aligned and aligned LLMs on two domains with rich human behavioral data. While no model reaches human-like diversity, aligned models generally display less diversity than their instruction fine-tuned counterparts. Our findings highlight potential trade-offs between increasing models' value alignment and decreasing the diversity of their conceptual representations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Distant-microphone meeting transcription is a challenging task. State-of-the-art end-to-end speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) architectures lack a multichannel noise and reverberation reduction front-end, which limits their performance. In this paper, we introduce a joint beamforming and SA-ASR approach for real meeting transcription. We first describe a data alignment and augmentation method to pretrain a neural beamformer on real meeting data. We then compare fixed, hybrid, and fully neural beamformers as front-ends to the SA-ASR model. Finally, we jointly optimize the fully neural beamformer and the SA-ASR model. Experiments on the real AMI corpus show that, while state-of-the-art multi-frame cross-channel attention based channel fusion fails to improve ASR performance, fine-tuning SA-ASR on the fixed beamformer's output and jointly fine-tuning SA-ASR with the neural beamformer reduce the word error rate by 8% and 9% relative, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) can store a massive amount of knowledge, yet their potential to acquire new knowledge remains unknown. We propose a novel evaluation framework that evaluates this capability. This framework prompts LLMs to generate questions about a statement introducing scientific knowledge, simulating a curious person when facing the statement for the first time. We score the qualities of the generated questions, thereby evaluating the knowledge acquisition potential of the LLM. We apply controlled ablation studies to validate our scoring procedures. Additionally, we created a synthetic dataset consisting of 1101 statements in physics, chemistry, and maths with distinct levels of difficulties, 300 general knowledge statements, and 567 incorrect statements. Human evaluations were conducted to validate our model assessments, achieving an approximate weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.7 on all three metrics considered. We find that while large models like GPT-4 and Mistral 8x7b are adept at generating coherent and relevant questions, the smaller Phi-2 model is equally or more effective. This indicates that size does not solely determine a model's knowledge acquisition potential. The proposed framework quantifies a critical model capability that was commonly overlooked and opens up research opportunities for developing more knowledgeable AI systems

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel multi-label classification approach to implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our approach features a multi-task model that jointly learns multi-label representations of implicit discourse relations across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. The model can also be adapted to the traditional single-label IDRR setting by selecting the sense with the highest probability in the multi-label representation. We conduct extensive experiments to identify optimal model configurations and loss functions in both settings. Our approach establishes the first benchmark for multi-label IDRR and achieves SOTA results on single-label IDRR using DiscoGeM. Finally, we evaluate our model on the PDTB 3.0 corpus in the single-label setting, presenting the first analysis of transfer learning between the DiscoGeM and PDTB 3.0 corpora for IDRR.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models like BERT excel at sentence classification tasks due to extensive pre-training on general data, but their robustness to parameter corruption is unexplored. To understand this better, we look at what happens if a language model is "broken", in the sense that some of its parameters are corrupted and then recovered by fine-tuning. Strategically corrupting BERT variants at different levels, we find corrupted models struggle to fully recover their original performance, with higher corruption causing more severe degradation. Notably, bottom-layer corruption affecting fundamental linguistic features is more detrimental than top-layer corruption. Our insights contribute to understanding language model robustness and adaptability under adverse conditions, informing strategies for developing resilient NLP systems against parameter perturbations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The relationship between electricity demand and variables such as economic activity and weather patterns is well established. However, this paper explores the connection between electricity demand and social aspects. It further embeds dynamic information about the state of society into energy demand modelling and forecasting approaches. Through the use of natural language processing on a large news corpus, we highlight this important link. This study is conducted in five regions of the UK and Ireland and considers multiple time horizons from 1 to 30 days. It also considers economic variables such as GDP, unemployment and inflation. The textual features used in this study represent central constructs from the word frequencies, topics, word embeddings extracted from the news. The findings indicate that: 1) the textual features are related to various contents, such as military conflicts, transportation, the global pandemic, regional economics, and the international energy market. They exhibit causal relationships with regional electricity demand, which are validated using Granger causality and Double Machine Learning methods. 2) Economic indicators play a more important role in the East Midlands and Northern Ireland, while social indicators are more influential in the West Midlands and the South West of England. 3) The use of these factors improves deterministic forecasting by around 6%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Basic values are concepts or beliefs which pertain to desirable end-states and transcend specific situations. Studying personal values in social media can illuminate how and why societal values evolve especially when the stimuli-based methods, such as surveys, are inefficient, for instance, in hard-to-reach populations. On the other hand, user-generated content is driven by the massive use of stereotyped, culturally defined speech constructions rather than authentic expressions of personal values. We aimed to find a model that can accurately detect value-expressive posts in Russian social media VKontakte. A training dataset of 5,035 posts was annotated by three experts, 304 crowd-workers and ChatGPT. Crowd-workers and experts showed only moderate agreement in categorizing posts. ChatGPT was more consistent but struggled with spam detection. We applied an ensemble of human- and AI-assisted annotation involving active learning approach, subsequently trained several classification models using embeddings from various pre-trained transformer-based language models. The best performance was achieved with embeddings from a fine-tuned rubert-tiny2 model, yielding high value detection quality (F1 = 0.75, F1-macro = 0.80). This model provides a crucial step to a study of values within and between Russian social media users.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The syntactic structure of a sentence can be represented as a graph, where vertices are words and edges indicate syntactic dependencies between them. In this setting, the distance between two linked words is defined as the difference between their positions. Here we wish to contribute to the characterization of the actual distribution of syntactic dependency distances, which has previously been argued to follow a power-law distribution. Here we propose a new model with two exponential regimes in which the probability decay is allowed to change after a break-point. This transition could mirror the transition from the processing of word chunks to higher-level structures. We find that a two-regime model - where the first regime follows either an exponential or a power-law decay - is the most likely one in all 20 languages we considered, independently of sentence length and annotation style. Moreover, the break-point exhibits low variation across languages and averages values of 4-5 words, suggesting that the amount of words that can be simultaneously processed abstracts from the specific language to a high degree. The probability decay slows down after the breakpoint, consistently with a universal chunk-and-pass mechanism. Finally, we give an account of the relation between the best estimated model and the closeness of syntactic dependencies as function of sentence length, according to a recently introduced optimality score.

  Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations, articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation. Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting, and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to 256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction, and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2 surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex semantic interpretation.

  Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities. Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

  Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly articles.We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters. Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1 scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models (VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3 remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

  The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion. OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1) an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable, variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D content.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself, with applications to shape analysis and matching.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images, resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

  Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs) driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database (CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues. The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate (RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

  Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

  Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central camera models.

  Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM) that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions. Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for autonomous driving applications.

  Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign language avatars.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets, such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection. However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a 55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\% improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth dataset.

  Machine learning-based Deepfake detection models have achieved impressive results on benchmark datasets, yet their performance often deteriorates significantly when evaluated on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we investigate an ensemble-based approach for improving the generalization of deepfake detection systems across diverse datasets. Building on a recent open-source benchmark, we combine prediction probabilities from several state-of-the-art asymmetric models proposed at top venues. Our experiments span two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based predictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios. Our results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery type or quality is often unavailable.

  Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels, and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

  As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS dataset will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image, as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones, necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios.

  Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes. However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation, we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

  Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets 56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video understanding.

  State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images, based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer. Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and 5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench. Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories (faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast, robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings. Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods, metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

  Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly, under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates. This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks, excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code and benchmark will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery. Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

  Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA) module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

  Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models, providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis. However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on positionalthis http URLremoving weakly paired terms in the joint marginal distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars. Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1) The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1) Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

  Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge. To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics, human-computer interaction, and beyond.

  Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible, rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance, delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework for generating 3D bridge data.This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance on the component completion task.This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

  The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage. Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently, we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context of diffusion models.

  Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks, subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the information related to element layouts, which are vital for document reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process, encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition, we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition, formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is competitive and compatible with various tasks.

  Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Virtual try-on has made significant progress in recent years. This paper addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly. Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings, enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the current methods.

  Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR. Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

  The acquisition of accurately coloured, balanced images in an optical microscope can be a challenge even for experienced microscope operators. This article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level that allows the correction of the microscopic colour images adequately. The results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital photography. The algorithm applied in this work is more effective than the classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

  Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures, 9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels. For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire 101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive, self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain real-world environments.

  Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis. Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence, military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models, representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths, limitations, and directions for futurethis http URLresearch shows that deep learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations, such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure, blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However, event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations. Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT) to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos, unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal training data.

  Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings: base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

  Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available atthis https URL

  Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives, which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13% across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

  Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain. This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize multiple lesioned brain images.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1 regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is received.

  Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation, and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping. It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features. The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome) for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC), that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect, to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth. Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.

  Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers, influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods (e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer. Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background, and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame. Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP) based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

  In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms, suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision, low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality inspection scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB, infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS. Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

  _Jiaxu Tian, Xuehui Yu, Yaoxing Wang, Pan Wang, Guangqian Guo, Shan Gao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human aesthetics and more explainable.

  Motivated by the growing demand for retrieval systems that operate across modalities, we introduce llama-nemoretriever-colembed, a unified text-image retrieval model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. We release two model variants, 1B and 3B. The 3B model achieves state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM), modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the model's retrieval capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes. For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just 15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise. The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times, cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the aging population.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference, and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22% for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies, respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn production systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks. ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances. iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities, generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective approach to 3D scene local editing.

  Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous vehicle perception systems require robust pedestrian detection, particularly on geometrically complex roadways like Type-S curved surfaces, where standard RGB camera-based methods face limitations. This paper introduces YOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework specifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural modifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7% mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset confirms the architecture's potential while highlighting the need for domain adaptation. This research advances the development of highly accurate, efficient, and adaptable perception systems based on cost-effective sensors, contributing to enhanced safety and reliability for autonomous navigation in challenging, less-structured driving environments.

  We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models.

  Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT. Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one. This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on several benchmark datasets.

  Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm to reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend to over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region, resulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM method that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions. Specially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework. Firstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial patches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on features extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates codebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked features to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns the assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on identifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling the model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a proposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated, which further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various downstream tasks. Code is available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous visual data sources. Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification performance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects, such as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is particularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame loss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above challenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction, improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution (OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA), designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt (i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained model are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification.

  Digital pathology has seen the advent of a wealth of foundational models (FM), yet to date their performance on cell phenotyping has not been benchmarked in a unified manner. We therefore propose PhenoBench: A comprehensive benchmark for cell phenotyping on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histopathology images. We provide both PhenoCell, a new H&E dataset featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks, establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and supervised models alike. Code and data are available on GitHub.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vanilla autoregressive image generation models generate visual tokens step-by-step, limiting their ability to capture holistic relationships among token sequences. Moreover, because most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, global information is limited. To address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Hita incorporates two key strategies to better align with the AR generation process: 1) {arranging} a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning, followed by patch-level tokens, and using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) adopting a lightweight fusion module before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder to control information flow and prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID} and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. Detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties, such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting. The code is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots). This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications, such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal in healthcare applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery, and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Object Detection (UAV-OD) faces substantial challenges, including small target sizes, high-density distributions, and cluttered backgrounds in UAV imagery. Current algorithms often depend on hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics, resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specificthis http URLaddress these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone. HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection. Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1% AP50 and 3.8% AP increase over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter count by 4M.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To address this challenge, we propose B√©zier curve Gaussian splatting (B√©zierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using learnable B√©zier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling, automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements. Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that B√©zierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios. We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector. This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct advantages across various video benchmarks.

  While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

  Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) is crucial for improving both human perception and computer vision tasks. This paper addresses two challenges in zero-reference LLIE: obtaining perceptually 'good' images using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model and maintaining computational efficiency for high-resolution images. We propose CLIP-Utilized Reinforcement learning-based Visual image Enhancement (CURVE). CURVE employs a simple image processing module which adjusts global image tone based on B√©zier curve and estimates its processing parameters iteratively. The estimator is trained by reinforcement learning with rewards designed using CLIP text embeddings. Experiments on low-light and multi-exposure datasets demonstrate the performance of CURVE in terms of enhancement quality and processing speed compared to conventional methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

  Object localization in satellite imagery is particularly challenging due to the high variability of objects, low spatial resolution, and interference from noise and dominant features such as clouds and city lights. In this research, we focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW), mesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique challenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and appearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature extent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these challenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed to improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP incorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture multi-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an Attention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant spatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements help to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model and state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in mAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively over state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite datasets. These consistent gains across all three satellite datasets highlight the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Our code is open sourced atthis https URL.

  Generative models enhance neuroimaging through data augmentation, quality improvement, and rare condition studies. Despite advances in realistic synthetic MRIs, evaluations focus on texture and perception, lacking sensitivity to crucial anatomical fidelity. This study proposes a new metric, called WASABI (Wasserstein-Based Anatomical Brain Index), to assess the anatomical realism of synthetic brain MRIs. WASABI leverages \textit{SynthSeg}, a deep learning-based brain parcellation tool, to derive volumetric measures of brain regions in each MRI and uses the multivariate Wasserstein distance to compare distributions between real and synthetic anatomies. Based on controlled experiments on two real datasets and synthetic MRIs from five generative models, WASABI demonstrates higher sensitivity in quantifying anatomical discrepancies compared to traditional image-level metrics, even when synthetic images achieve near-perfect visual quality. Our findings advocate for shifting the evaluation paradigm beyond visual inspection and conventional metrics, emphasizing anatomical fidelity as a crucial benchmark for clinically meaningful brain MRI synthesis.

  Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) process images as a whole. Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and generate more realistic images. HDM essentially is a DDPM that incorporates an attention mechanism between pixels. In HDM, the discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).

  Predicting future trajectories of surrounding vehicles heavily relies on what contextual information is given to a motion prediction model. The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SS-SS) aims to mitigate the heavy annotation burden of dense pixel labeling by leveraging abundant unlabeled images alongside a small labeled set. While current consistency regularization methods achieve strong results, they often overlook a critical challenge: the precise delineation of object boundaries. In this paper, we propose BoundMatch, a novel multi-task SS-SS framework that explicitly integrates semantic boundary detection into a teacher-student consistency regularization pipeline. Our core mechanism, Boundary Consistency Regularized Multi-Task Learning (BCRM), enforces prediction agreement between teacher and student models on both segmentation masks and detailed semantic boundaries. To further enhance performance and sharpen boundaries, BoundMatch incorporates two lightweight fusion modules: Boundary-Semantic Fusion (BSF) injects learned boundary cues into the segmentation decoder, while Spatial Gradient Fusion (SGF) refines boundary predictions using mask gradients, leading to higher-quality boundary pseudo-labels. This framework is built upon SAMTH, a strong teacher-student baseline featuring a Harmonious Batch Normalization (HBN) update strategy for improved stability. Extensive experiments on diverse urban-driving scene datasets including Cityscapes, BDD100K, and SYNTHIA show that BoundMatch achieves competitive performance against current state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the new benchmark with DINOv2 foundation model. We further validate our approach's generalizability on Pascal VOC and ADE20K datasets. Ablation studies highlight BoundMatch's ability to improve boundary-specific evaluation metrics, its effectiveness in realistic large-scale unlabeled data scenarios, and applicability to lightweight architectures for mobile deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has gained popularity for its shift towards next-scale prediction. However, existing VAR paradigms process the entire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime scaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we propose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution scaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\times$ with negligible performance drop of <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution images. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory footprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

  High-resolution semantic segmentation is essential for applications such as image editing, bokeh imaging, AR/VR, etc. Unfortunately, existing datasets often have limited resolution and lack precise mask details and boundaries. In this work, we build a large-scale, matting-level semantic segmentation dataset, named MaSS13K, which consists of 13,348 real-world images, all at 4K resolution. MaSS13K provides high-quality mask annotations of a number of objects, which are categorized into seven categories: human, vegetation, ground, sky, water, building, and others. MaSS13K features precise masks, with an average mask complexity 20-50 times higher than existing semantic segmentation datasets. We consequently present a method specifically designed for high-resolution semantic segmentation, namely MaSSFormer, which employs an efficient pixel decoder that aggregates high-level semantic features and low-level texture features across three stages, aiming to produce high-resolution masks with minimal computational cost. Finally, we propose a new learning paradigm, which integrates the high-quality masks of the seven given categories with pseudo labels from new classes, enabling MaSSFormer to transfer its accurate segmentation capability to other classes of objects. Our proposed MaSSFormer is comprehensively evaluated on the MaSS13K benchmark together with 14 representative segmentation models. We expect that our meticulously annotated MaSS13K dataset and the MaSSFormer model can facilitate the research of high-resolution and high-quality semantic segmentation.

  Although text-to-image generation technologies have made significant advancements, they still face challenges when dealing with ambiguous prompts and aligning outputs with userthis http URLproposed framework, TDRI (Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation), addresses these issues by enhancing image generation through iterative user interaction. It consists of two phases: the Initial Generation Phase, which creates base images based on user prompts, and the Interactive Refinement Phase, which integrates user feedback through three key modules. The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user feedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the alignment between user intent and model input. By evaluating generated outputs against user expectations, the Feedback-Reflection (FR) module identifies discrepancies and facilitates improvements. In an effort to ensure consistently high-quality results, the Adaptive Optimization (AO) module fine-tunes the generation process by balancing user preferences and maintaining prompt fidelity. Experimental results show that TDRI outperforms existing methods by achieving 33.6% human preference, compared to 6.2% for GPT-4 augmentation, and the highest CLIP and BLIP alignment scores (0.338 and 0.336, respectively). In iterative feedback tasks, user satisfaction increased to 88% after 8 rounds, with diminishing returns beyond 6 rounds. Furthermore, TDRI has been found to reduce the number of iterations and improve personalization in the creation of fashion products. TDRI exhibits a strong potential for a wide range of applications in the creative and industrial domains, as it streamlines the creative process and improves alignment with user preferences

  Generative AI has significantly advanced text-driven image generation, but it still faces challenges in producing outputs that consistently align with evolving user preferences and intents, particularly in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.

  Video large language models (ViLLMs) excel in general video understanding, e.g., recognizing activities like talking and eating, but struggle with identity-aware comprehension, such as "Wilson is receiving chemotherapy" or "Tom is discussing with Sarah", limiting their applicability in smart healthcare and smart home environments. To address this limitation, we propose a one-shot learning framework PVChat, the first personalized ViLLM that enables subject-aware question answering (QA) from a single video for each subject. Our approach optimizes a Mixture-of-Heads (MoH) enhanced ViLLM on a synthetically augmented video-QA dataset, leveraging a progressive image-to-video learning strategy. Specifically, we introduce an automated augmentation pipeline that synthesizes identity-preserving positive samples and retrieves hard negatives from existing video corpora, generating a diverse training dataset with four QA types: existence, appearance, action, and location inquiries. To enhance subject-specific learning, we propose a ReLU Routing MoH attention mechanism, alongside two novel objectives: (1) Smooth Proximity Regularization for progressive learning through exponential distance scaling and (2) Head Activation Enhancement for balanced attention routing. Finally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy, transitioning from image pre-training to video fine-tuning, enabling a gradual learning process from static attributes to dynamic representations. We evaluate PVChat on diverse datasets covering medical scenarios, TV series, anime, and real-world footage, demonstrating its superiority in personalized feature understanding after learning from a single video, compared to state-of-the-art ViLLMs.

We explore in detail the sub-tasks within each category. We also summarize the main challenges and trends currently existing in the field. Furthermore, this paper presents an overview of high-quality egocentric vision datasets, offering valuable resources for future research.

  Fire and smoke phenomena pose a significant threat to the natural environment, ecosystems, and global economy, as well as human lives and wildlife. In this particular circumstance, there is a demand for more sophisticated and advanced technologies to implement an effective strategy for early detection, real-time monitoring, and minimizing the overall impacts of fires on ecological balance and public safety. Recently, the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) frameworks has substantially revolutionized the momentum for developing efficient fire management systems. However, these systems extensively rely on the availability of adequate and high-quality fire and smoke data to create proficient Machine Learning (ML) methods for various tasks, such as detection and monitoring. Although fire and smoke datasets play a critical role in training, evaluating, and testing advanced Deep Learning (DL) models, a comprehensive review of the existing datasets is still unexplored. For this purpose, we provide an in-depth review to systematically analyze and evaluate fire and smoke datasets collected over the past 20 years. We investigate the characteristics of each dataset, including type, size, format, collection methods, and geographical diversities. We also review and highlight the unique features of each dataset, such as imaging modalities (RGB, thermal, infrared) and their applicability for different fire management tasks (classification, segmentation, detection). Furthermore, we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each dataset and discuss their potential for advancing research and technology in fire management. Ultimately, we conduct extensive experimental analyses across different datasets using several state-of-the-art algorithms, such as ResNet-50, DeepLab-V3, and YoloV8.

  With the rapid development of diffusion models in image generation, the demand for more powerful and flexible controllable frameworks is increasing. Although existing methods can guide generation beyond text prompts, the challenge of effectively combining multiple conditional inputs while maintaining consistency with all of them remains unsolved. To address this, we introduce UniCombine, a DiT-based multi-conditional controllable generative framework capable of handling any combination of conditions, including but not limited to text prompts, spatial maps, and subject images. Specifically, we introduce a novel Conditional MMDiT Attention mechanism and incorporate a trainable LoRA module to build both the training-free and training-based versions. Additionally, we propose a new pipeline to construct SubjectSpatial200K, the first dataset designed for multi-conditional generative tasks covering both the subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditions. Extensive experimental results on multi-conditional generation demonstrate the outstanding universality and powerful capability of our approach with state-of-the-art performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Filter Like You Test (FLYT), an algorithm for curating large-scale vision-language datasets that learns the usefulness of each data point as a pretraining example. FLYT trains a scoring model that learns to weigh each example's features using gradient signals from downstream tasks training sets. Based on FLYT, we implement Mixing-FLYT (M-FLYT), which takes the per-example scores generated by different scoring methods as features, and learns to unify them into a single score. FLYT naturally produces a distribution over the training examples, which we leverage through Soft Cap Sampling (SCS), a strategy for obtaining a filtered pretraining dataset from per-example probabilities that samples examples while preventing over-representation through a repetition penalty. Using these methods, we achieve 40.1% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy on the DataComp medium scale filtering benchmark, a 2% absolute accuracy increase over all previous results and a 5.5% increase over results that - like us - use only public resources. Our approach also yields 37.7\% on the average of 38 DataComp evaluation tasks, outperforming previous public-resource approaches by 0.4\%.

  Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from replicating human-like behaviors, generalizing effectively in multi-agent scenarios, and overcoming inherent interpretabilitythis http URLtasks are compounded when deep environment understanding, agent coordination and dynamic optimization are required. While Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced methods have shown promise in generalization and interoperability, they often neglect necessary multi-agent coordination. Therefore, we introduce the Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent (CCMA) framework, integrating RL for individual interactions, a fine-tuned LLM for regional cooperation, a reward function for global optimization, and the Retrieval-augmented Generation mechanism to dynamically optimize decision-making across complex driving scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the CCMA outperforms existing RL methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both micro and macro-level performance in complex driving environments.

  Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets.

  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential due to their low energy consumption. Converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs is an efficient way to achieve high-performance SNNs. However, many conversion methods are based on rate coding, which requires numerous spikes and longer time-steps compared to directly trained SNNs, leading to increased energy consumption and latency. This article introduces differential coding for ANN-to-SNN conversion, a novel coding scheme that reduces spike counts and energy consumption by transmitting changes in rate information rather than rates directly, and explores its application across various layers. Additionally, the threshold iteration method is proposed to optimize thresholds based on activation distribution when converting Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to spiking neurons. Experimental results on various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers demonstrate that the proposed differential coding significantly improves accuracy while reducing energy consumption, particularly when combined with the threshold iteration method, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The source codes of the proposed method are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Question Answering (VQA) focuses on providing answers to natural language questions by utilizing information from images. Although cutting-edge multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o achieve strong performance on VQA tasks, they frequently fall short in accessing domain-specific or the latest knowledge. To mitigate this issue, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) leveraging external knowledge bases (KBs), referred to as KB-VQA, emerges as a promising approach. Nevertheless, conventional unimodal retrieval techniques, which translate images into textual descriptions, often result in the loss of critical visual details. To address these challenges, this study presents two key innovations. First, we introduce fine-grained knowledge units that consist of multimodal data fragments (e.g. text fragments, entity images, and so on) in a structured manner. Rather than merely refining retrieval mechanisms, we prioritize the systematic organization and management of these knowledge units, ensuring that the structuring process itself enhances retrieval quality. Second, we propose a knowledge unit retrieval-augmented generation framework (KU-RAG) that seamlessly integrates fine-grained retrieval with MLLMs. Our KU-RAG framework not only ensures precise retrieval of relevant knowledge but also enhances reasoning capabilities through a knowledge correction chain. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing KB-VQA methods across four benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of approximately 3% and up to 11% in the best case.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives--such as attributes and objects--that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose a Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.

  In the rapidly evolving field of image generation, achieving precise control over generated content and maintaining semantic consistency remain significant limitations, particularly concerning grounding techniques and the necessity for model fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose BayesGenie, an off-the-shelf approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization to facilitate precise and user-friendly image editing. Our method enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions without manual area marking, while preserving the original image's semantic integrity. Unlike existing techniques that require extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, our approach demonstrates remarkable adaptability across various LLMs through its model-agnostic design. BayesGenie employs an adapted Bayesian optimization strategy to automatically refine the inference process parameters, achieving high-precision image editing with minimal user intervention. Through extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in both editing accuracy and semantic preservation, as validated using different LLMs including Claude3 and GPT-4.

  Diffusion models are successful for synthesizing high-quality videos but are limited to generating short clips (e.g., 2-10 seconds). Synthesizing sustained footage (e.g. over minutes) still remains an open research question. In this paper, we propose MALT Diffusion (using Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers), a new diffusion model specialized for long video generation. MALT Diffusion (or just MALT) handles long videos by subdividing them into short segments and doing segment-level autoregressive generation. To achieve this, we first propose recurrent attention layers that encode multiple segments into a compact memory latent vector; by maintaining this memory vector over time, MALT is able to condition on it and continuously generate new footage based on a long temporal context. We also present several training techniques that enable the model to generate frames over a long horizon with consistent quality and minimal degradation. We validate the effectiveness of MALT through experiments on long video benchmarks. We first perform extensive analysis of MALT in long-contextual understanding capability and stability using popular long video benchmarks. For example, MALT achieves an FVD score of 220.4 on 128-frame video generation on UCF-101, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of 648.4. Finally, we explore MALT's capabilities in a text-to-video generation setting and show that it can produce long videos compared with recent techniques for long text-to-video generation.

  Probabilistic human motion prediction aims to forecast multiple possible future movements from past observations. While current approaches report high diversity and realism, they often generate motions with undetected limb stretching and jitter. To address this, we introduce SkeletonDiffusion, a latent diffusion model that embeds an explicit inductive bias on the human body within its architecture and training. Our model is trained with a novel nonisotropic Gaussian diffusion formulation that aligns with the natural kinematic structure of the human skeleton. Results show that our approach outperforms conventional isotropic alternatives, consistently generating realistic predictions while avoiding artifacts such as limb distortion. Additionally, we identify a limitation in commonly used diversity metrics, which may inadvertently favor models that produce inconsistent limb lengths within the same sequence. SkeletonDiffusion sets a new benchmark on real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines across multiple evaluation metrics. Visit our project page atthis https URL.

  3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nearest neighbor (NN) graph based visual re-ranking has emerged as a powerful approach for improving retrieval accuracy, offering the advantages of effectively exploring high-dimensional manifolds without requiring additional fine-tuning. However, the effectiveness of NN graph-based re-ranking is fundamentally constrained by the quality of its edge connectivity, as incorrect connections between dissimilar (negative) images frequently occur. This is known as a noisy edge problem, which hinders the re-ranking performance of existing techniques and limits their potential. To remedy this issue, we propose a complementary denoising method based on Continuous Conditional Random Fields (C-CRF) that leverages statistical distances derived from similarity-based distributions. As a pre-processing step for enhancing NN graph-based retrieval, our approach constructs fully connected cliques around each anchor image and employs a novel statistical distance metric to robustly alleviate noisy edges before re-ranking while achieving efficient processing through offline computation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves three different NN graph-based re-ranking approaches, yielding significant gains in retrieval accuracy.

  Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generation techniques, current methods often suffer from geometric inconsistencies, commonly referred to as the Janus Problem. This paper identifies the root cause of the Janus Problem: viewpoint generation bias in diffusion models, which creates a significant gap between the actual generated viewpoint and the expected one required for optimizing the 3D model. To address this issue, we propose a tuning-free approach called the Attention and CLIP Guidance (ACG) mechanism. ACG enhances desired viewpoints by adaptively controlling cross-attention maps, employs CLIP-based view-text similarities to filter out erroneous viewpoints, and uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with staged prompts to progressively refine 3D generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the Janus Problem without compromising generation speed, establishing ACG as an efficient, plug-and-play component for existing text-to-3D frameworks.

  We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is atthis https URL.

  Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs.

PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64*64.

  Driving view synthesis along free-form trajectories is essential for realistic driving simulations, enabling closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end driving policies. Existing methods excel at view interpolation along recorded paths but struggle to generalize to novel trajectories due to limited viewpoints in driving videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose DriveX, a novel free-form driving view synthesis framework, that progressively distills generative prior into the 3D Gaussian model during its optimization. Within this framework, we utilize a video diffusion model to refine the degraded novel trajectory renderings from the in-training Gaussian model, while the restored videos in turn serve as additional supervision for optimizing the 3D Gaussian. Concretely, we craft an inpainting-based video restoration task, which can disentangle the identification of degraded regions from the generative capability of the diffusion model and remove the need of simulating specific degraded pattern in the training of the diffusion model. To further enhance the consistency and fidelity of generated contents, the pseudo ground truth is progressively updated with gradually improved novel trajectory rendering, allowing both components to co-adapt and reinforce each other while minimizing the disruption on the optimization. By tightly integrating 3D scene representation with generative prior, DriveX achieves high-quality view synthesis beyond recorded trajectories in real time--unlocking new possibilities for flexible and realistic driving simulations on free-form trajectories.

  Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers. Codes are provided in thethis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks, while achieving remarkable success across diverse tasks, demand significant resources, including computation, GPU memory, bandwidth, storage, and energy. Network quantization, as a standard compression and acceleration technique, reduces storage costs and enables potential inference acceleration by discretizing network weights and activations into a finite set of integer values. However, current quantization methods are often complex and sensitive, requiring extensive task-specific hyperparameters, where even a single misconfiguration can impair model performance, limiting generality across different models and tasks. In this paper, we propose Quantization without Tears (QwT), a method that simultaneously achieves quantization speed, accuracy, simplicity, and generality. The key insight of QwT is to incorporate a lightweight additional structure into the quantized network to mitigate information loss during quantization. This structure consists solely of a small set of linear layers, keeping the method simple and efficient. More importantly, it provides a closed-form solution, allowing us to improve accuracy effortlessly under 2 minutes. Extensive experiments across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks demonstrate that QwT is both highly effective and versatile. In fact, our approach offers a robust solution for network quantization that combines simplicity, accuracy, and adaptability, which provides new insights for the design of novel quantization paradigms.

  Predicting stroke risk is a complex challenge that can be enhanced by integrating diverse clinically available data modalities. This study introduces a self-supervised multimodal framework that combines 3D brain imaging, clinical data, and image-derived features to improve stroke risk prediction prior to onset. By leveraging large unannotated clinical datasets, the framework captures complementary and synergistic information across image and tabular data modalities. Our approach is based on a contrastive learning framework that couples contrastive language-image pretraining with an image-tabular matching module, to better align multimodal data representations in a shared latent space. The model is trained on the UK Biobank, which includes structural brain MRI and clinical data. We benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal methods using tabular, image, and image-tabular combinations under diverse frozen and trainable model settings. The proposed model outperformed self-supervised tabular (image) methods by 2.6% (2.6%) in ROC-AUC and by 3.3% (5.6%) in balanced accuracy. Additionally, it showed a 7.6% increase in balanced accuracy compared to the best multimodal supervised model. Through interpretable tools, our approach demonstrated better integration of tabular and image data, providing richer and more aligned embeddings. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping heatmaps further revealed activated brain regions commonly associated in the literature with brain aging, stroke risk, and clinical outcomes. This robust self-supervised multimodal framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods for stroke risk prediction and offers a strong foundation for future studies integrating diverse data modalities to advance clinical predictive modelling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Images captured in challenging environments--such as nighttime, smoke, rainy weather, and underwater--often suffer from significant degradation, resulting in a substantial loss of visual quality. The effective restoration of these degraded images is critical for the subsequent vision tasks. While many existing approaches have successfully incorporated specific priors for individual tasks, these tailored solutions limit their applicability to other degradations. In this work, we propose a universal network architecture, dubbed ``ReviveDiff'', which can address various degradations and bring images back to life by enhancing and restoring their quality. Our approach is inspired by the observation that, unlike degradation caused by movement or electronic issues, quality degradation under adverse conditions primarily stems from natural media (such as fog, water, and low luminance), which generally preserves the original structures of objects. To restore the quality of such images, we leveraged the latest advancements in diffusion models and developed ReviveDiff to restore image quality from both macro and micro levels across some key factors determining image quality, such as sharpness, distortion, noise level, dynamic range, and color accuracy. We rigorously evaluated ReviveDiff on seven benchmark datasets covering five types of degrading conditions: Rainy, Underwater, Low-light, Smoke, and Nighttime Hazy. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReviveDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.

Current monitoring technologies for detecting underwater litter face limitations in survey efficiency, cost, and environmental conditions, highlighting the need for efficient, consumer-grade technologies for automatic detection. This research introduces the Aerial-Aquatic Speedy Scanner (AASS) combined with Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) and an improved YOLOv8 detection network. AASS enhances data acquisition efficiency over traditional methods, capturing high-quality images that accurately identify underwater waste. SRR improves image-resolution by mitigating motion blur and insufficient resolution, thereby enhancing detection tasks. Specifically, the RCAN model achieved the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 78.6% for detection accuracy on reconstructed images among the tested SRR models. With a magnification factor of 4, the SRR test set shows an improved mAP compared to the conventional bicubic set. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting underwater litter.

  Hermit crabs play a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by dispersing seeds, cleaning up debris, and disturbing soil. They serve as vital indicators of marine environmental health, responding to climate change and pollution. Traditional survey methods, like quadrat sampling, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and environmentally dependent. This study presents an innovative approach combining UAV-based remote sensing with Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) and the CRAB-YOLO detection network, a modification of YOLOv8s, to monitor hermit crabs. SRR enhances image quality by addressing issues such as motion blur and insufficient resolution, significantly improving detection accuracy over conventional low-resolution fuzzy images. The CRAB-YOLO network integrates three improvements for detection accuracy, hermit crab characteristics, and computational efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to other mainstream detection models. The RDN networks demonstrated the best image reconstruction performance, and CRAB-YOLO achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 69.5% on the SRR test set, a 40% improvement over the conventional Bicubic method with a magnification factor of 4. These results indicate that the proposed method is effective in detecting hermit crabs, offering a cost-effective and automated solution for extensive hermit crab monitoring, thereby aiding coastal benthos conservation.

  _Naichuan Zheng, Yuchen Du, Hailun Xia, Zeyu Liang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For multimodal skeleton-based action recognition, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are effective models. Still, their reliance on floating-point computations leads to high energy consumption, limiting their applicability in battery-powered devices. While energy-efficient, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) struggle to model skeleton dynamics, leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose Signal-SGN (Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which utilizes the temporal dimension of skeleton sequences as the spike time steps and represents features as multi-dimensional discrete stochastic signals for temporal-frequency domain feature extraction. It combines the 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) module and the Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) module to extract features from the skeleton represented as spiking form. Additionally, the Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Feature Fusion (MWTF) module is proposed to extract dynamic spiking features and capture frequency-specific characteristics, enhancing classification performance. Experiments across three large-scale datasets reveal Signal-SGN exceeding state-of-the-art SNN-based methods in accuracy and computational efficiency while attaining comparable performance with GCN methods and significantly reducing theoretical energy consumption.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the largest abdominal CT dataset (termed AbdomenAtlas) of 20,460 three-dimensional CT volumes sourced from 112 hospitals across diverse populations, geographies, and facilities. AbdomenAtlas provides 673K high-quality masks of anatomical structures in the abdominal region annotated by a team of 10 radiologists with the help of AI algorithms. We start by having expert radiologists manually annotate 22 anatomical structures in 5,246 CT volumes. Following this, a semi-automatic annotation procedure is performed for the remaining CT volumes, where radiologists revise the annotations predicted by AI, and in turn, AI improves its predictions by learning from revised annotations. Such a large-scale, detailed-annotated, and multi-center dataset is needed for two reasons. Firstly, AbdomenAtlas provides important resources for AI development at scale, branded as large pre-trained models, which can alleviate the annotation workload of expert radiologists to transfer to broader clinical applications. Secondly, AbdomenAtlas establishes a large-scale benchmark for evaluating AI algorithms -- the more data we use to test the algorithms, the better we can guarantee reliable performance in complex clinical scenarios. An ISBI & MICCAI challenge named BodyMaps: Towards 3D Atlas of Human Body was launched using a subset of our AbdomenAtlas, aiming to stimulate AI innovation and to benchmark segmentation accuracy, inference efficiency, and domain generalizability. We hope our AbdomenAtlas can set the stage for larger-scale clinical trials and offer exceptional opportunities to practitioners in the medical imaging community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile service robots can benefit from object-level understanding of their environments, including the ability to distinguish object instances and re-identify previously seen instances. Object re-identification is challenging across different viewpoints and in scenes with significant appearance variation arising from weather or lighting changes. Existing works on object re-identification either focus on specific classes or require foreground segmentation. Further, these methods, along with object re-identification datasets, have limited consideration of challenges such as outdoor scenes and illumination changes. To address this problem, we introduce CODa Re-ID: an in-the-wild object re-identification dataset containing 1,037,814 observations of 557 objects across 8 classes under diverse lighting conditions and viewpoints. Further, we propose CLOVER, a representation learning method for object observations that can distinguish between static object instances without requiring foreground segmentation. We also introduce MapCLOVER, a method for scalably summarizing CLOVER descriptors for use in object maps and matching new observations to summarized descriptors. Our results show that CLOVER achieves superior performance in static object re-identification under varying lighting conditions and viewpoint changes and can generalize to unseen instances and classes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Light Video Enhancement (LLVE) seeks to restore dynamic or static scenes plagued by severe invisibility and noise. In this paper, we present an innovative video decomposition strategy that incorporates view-independent and view-dependent components to enhance the performance of LLVE. We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely recognized LLVE benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios. Our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new SOTA performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The current state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) require extensive training on video datasets with mask annotations, limiting their effectiveness in handling challenging scenarios. However, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) introduces a new prompt-driven paradigm for image segmentation, offering new possibilities. In this study, we investigate SAM's potential for UVOS through different prompt strategies. We then propose UVOSAM, a mask-free paradigm for UVOS that utilizes the STD-Net tracker. STD-Net incorporates a spatial-temporal decoupled deformable attention mechanism to establish an effective correlation between intra- and inter-frame features, remarkably enhancing the quality of box prompts in complex video scenes. Extensive experiments on the DAVIS2017-unsupervised and YoutubeVIS19\&21 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of UVOSAM without mask supervision compared to existing mask-supervised methods, as well as its ability to generalize to weakly-annotated video datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The evolution of wireless communication systems requires flexible, energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies. Pinching antennas (PAs), which can dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation through binary activation states, have recently emerged as a promising candidate. In this work, we investigate the problem of optimally selecting a subset of fixed-position PAs to activate in a waveguide, when the aim is to maximize the communication rate at a user terminal. Due to the complex interplay between antenna activation, waveguide-induced phase shifts, and power division, this problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. To efficiently solve this challenging problem, we use neural network architectures of varying complexity to learn activation policies directly from data, leveraging spatial features and signal structure. Furthermore, we incorporate user location uncertainty into our training and evaluation pipeline to simulate realistic deployment conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Associative Memories like the famous Hopfield Networks are elegant models for describing fully recurrent neural networks whose fundamental job is to store and retrieve information. In the past few years they experienced a surge of interest due to novel theoretical results pertaining to their information storage capabilities, and their relationship with SOTA AI architectures, such as Transformers and Diffusion Models. These connections open up possibilities for interpreting the computation of traditional AI networks through the theoretical lens of Associative Memories. Additionally, novel Lagrangian formulations of these networks make it possible to design powerful distributed models that learn useful representations and inform the design of novel architectures. This tutorial provides an approachable introduction to Associative Memories, emphasizing the modern language and methods used in this area of research, with practical hands-on mathematical derivations and coding notebooks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based models. Our code is publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel method for partial optimization of the connections in Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs). Our training method utilizes a probability distribution over a subset of connections per gate input, selecting the connection with highest merit, after which the gate-types are selected. We show that the connection-optimized LGNs outperform standard fixed-connection LGNs on the Yin-Yang, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks, while requiring only a fraction of the number of logic gates. When training all connections, we demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on the MNIST data set. Additionally, we show that our network has 24 times fewer gates, while performing better on the MNIST data set compared to standard fully connected LGNs. As such, our work shows a pathway towards fully trainable Boolean logic.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian (ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced sample efficiency compared to baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and program synthesis. Despite their strong performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding (CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework, CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2% while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences. Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

  We present EdgeCodec, an end-to-end neural compressor for barometric data collected from wind turbine blades. EdgeCodec leverages a heavily asymmetric autoencoder architecture, trained with a discriminator and enhanced by a Residual Vector Quantizer to maximize compression efficiency. It achieves compression rates between 2'560:1 and 10'240:1 while maintaining a reconstruction error below 3%, and operates in real time on the GAP9 microcontroller with bitrates ranging from 11.25 to 45 bits per second. Bitrates can be selected on a sample-by-sample basis, enabling on-the-fly adaptation to varying network conditions. In its highest compression mode, EdgeCodec reduces the energy consumption of wireless data transmission by up to 2.9x, significantly extending the operational lifetime of deployed sensor units.

  The high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) setting presents significant challenges in various applications where the feature dimension far exceeds the number of available samples. This paper introduces a universal approach for learning in HDLSS setting using multi-view mid fusion techniques. It shows how existing mid fusion multi-view methods perform well in an HDLSS setting even if no inherent views are provided. Three view construction methods are proposed that split the high-dimensional feature vectors into smaller subsets, each representing a different view. Extensive experimental validation across model-types and learning tasks confirm the effectiveness and generalization of the approach. We believe the work in this paper lays the foundation for further research into the universal benefits of multi-view mid fusion learning.

  _Hanyang Peng, Shuang Qin, Yue Yu, Fangqing Jiang, Hui Wang, Zhouchen Lin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for training deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success, its theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t \frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O} \left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter $\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between theory and practice.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Noisy labels pose significant challenges for AI model training in veterinary medicine. This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction. To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of 70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While AdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost demonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms showed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23% to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from 84.84% to 89.69%, respectively. These results highlight the importance of minimizing label noise to improve classification algorithms for the detection of canine heart murmurs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a "synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities, can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing methods.

  While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge, interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in the presence of dataset biases.

  _Marco Roschkowski_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.

  Cardiac diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which requires accurate and timely diagnostic strategies. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image registration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical properties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease classification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean material to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field while ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable approach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides insights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues. Evaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved Dice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right ventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the local strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features used for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the most relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing classifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and 100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset. By integrating explainable artificial intelligence, this method empowers clinicians with a transparent understanding of the model's predictions based on cardiac mechanics, while also significantly improving the accuracy and reliability of cardiac disease diagnosis, paving the way for more personalized and effective patient care.

  AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate foundation models. Accurate modeling of complex atmospheric dynamics at high spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand, we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems. We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs, 23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency versus 51% without model parallelism.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible deployment. However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism. Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic vehicular environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment. We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii) adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation, creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage, and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

  Canine gait analysis using wearable inertial sensors is gaining attention in veterinary clinical settings, as it provides valuable insights into a range of mobility impairments. Neurological and orthopedic conditions cannot always be easily distinguished even by experienced clinicians. The current study explored and developed a deep learning approach using inertial sensor readings to assess whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor configurations, assessment protocols, and enhancements to deep learning model architectures were further suggested. Using a dataset of 29 dogs, our proposed approach achieved 96% accuracy in the multiclass classification task (healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in the binary classification task (healthy/non-healthy) when generalizing to unseen dogs. Our results demonstrate the potential of inertial-based deep learning models to serve as a practical and objective diagnostic and clinical aid to differentiate gait assessment in orthopedic and neurological conditions.

  Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work we propose a unified Fourier Spectral Transformer network that integrates the strengths of classical spectral methods and attention based neural architectures. By transforming the original PDEs into spectral ordinary differential equations, we use high precision numerical solvers to generate training data and use a Transformer network to model the evolution of the spectral coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one dimensional Burgers' equation. The results show that our spectral Transformer can achieve highly accurate long term predictions even with limited training data, better than traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods in forecasting future flow dynamics. The proposed framework generalizes well to unseen data, bringing a promising paradigm for real time prediction and control of complex dynamical systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load, limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information, including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style. While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature concatenation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with noisy edges. We propose Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in settings with noisy relational structures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

  _Michalis Korakakis, Andreas Vlachos, Adrian Weller_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts, i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's broad applicability.

  User growth is a major strategy for consumer internet companies. To optimize costly marketing campaigns and maximize user engagement, we propose a novel treatment effect optimization methodology to enhance user growth marketing. By leveraging deep learning, our algorithm learns from past experiments to optimize user selection and reward allocation, maximizing campaign impact while minimizing costs. Unlike traditional prediction methods, our model directly models uplifts in key business metrics. Further, our deep learning model can jointly optimize parameters for an aggregated loss function using softmax gating. Our approach surpasses traditional methods by directly targeting desired business metrics and demonstrates superior algorithmic flexibility in handling complex business constraints. Comprehensive evaluations, including comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques such as R-learner and Causal Forest, validate the effectiveness of our model. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed constrained and direct optimization algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by over $20\%$, proving their cost-efficiency and real-world impact. The versatile methods can be applied to various product scenarios, including optimal treatment allocation. Its effectiveness has also been validated through successful worldwide production deployments.

  Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent years, with communication overhead often emerging as a critical bottleneck. Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on distributed deep learning tasks.

  We present an integrated graph-based neural networks architecture for predicting campus buildings occupancy and inter-buildings movement at dynamic temporal resolution that learns traffic flow patterns from Wi-Fi logs combined with the usage schedules within the buildings. The relative traffic flows are directly estimated from the WiFi data without assuming the occupant behaviour or preferences while maintaining individual privacy. We formulate the problem as a data-driven graph structure represented by a set of nodes (representing buildings), connected through a route of edges or links using a novel Graph Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) which has shown remarkable success in modelling complex patterns. We describe the formulation, model estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance of our proposed model. We also present an illustrative architecture of the models and apply on real-world WiFi logs collected at the Toronto Metropolitan University campus. The results of the experiments show that the integrated GCLSTM models significantly outperform traditional pedestrian flow estimators like the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Linear Regression.

  Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However, efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a) discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network (HiDeNN) and Convolutional HiDeNN. The article also provides a clear idea about the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings. Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection. We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm considerably in comparison to other exploration methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback, they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants: standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN (H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to 5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048 tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

  We design and implement AXLearn, a production deep learning system that facilitates scalable and high-performance training of large deep learning models. Compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning systems, AXLearn has a unique focus on modularity and support for heterogeneous hardware infrastructure. AXLearn's internal interfaces between software components follow strict encapsulation, allowing different components to be assembled to facilitate rapid model development and experimentation on heterogeneous compute infrastructure. We introduce a novel method of quantifying modularity via Lines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to linear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred of modules with just 10 lines of code, compared to hundreds as required in other systems. At the same time, AXLearn maintains equivalent performance compared to state-of-the-art training systems. Finally, we share our experience in the development and operation of AXLearn.

In detail, we show that with negligible computational overhead, $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$ exploiting the estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks, including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide answers with high confidence (i.e., at least 99%).

  Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

  In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards. Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of \textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans, showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement learning.

  Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation, meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments. Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are required.

  Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate decay and defining a stopping criterion, often relies on monitoring the validation loss. This paper presents NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for optimizing neural network training efficiently

  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage. Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2) mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64% while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art XAI-based compression method.

  Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have significantly improved performance by incorporating external information through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics. Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined, globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA, which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

  Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision, and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums, means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source code, documentation, and usage examples are available atthis http URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations? We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task - preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen, independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings, thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to 42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient, scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be released based on publication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer potential for near-term quantum advantage but face challenges from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish, and poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. We introduce GuiderNet, a meta-learning framework that conditions Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) using data-dependent parameter shifts aimed at minimizing the log condition number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. Implemented as a classical neural network, GuiderNet is meta-trained to guide PQC parameters into geometrically favorable regions and is embedded within hybrid quantum-classical pipelines to steer both initialization and adaptive modulation during training.Applied to the Kaggle Diabetes classification task, GuiderNet reduces cumulative training loss by over 5x, improves test accuracy from 75.3% to 98.6%, and increases the minority-class F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. It also suppresses gradient explosion and stabilizes parameter updates, enabling smoother and more robust optimization. These results demonstrate that geometric meta-conditioning can mitigate barren plateaus and ill-conditioning, providing a scalable approach to enhance trainability and generalization in quantum machine learning.

Motivated by the growing relevance of first-price auctions and the predictive capabilities of machine learning models, this paper proposes a new algorithm within the BROAD-OMD framework (Hu et al., 2025) that leverages predictions of the highest competing bid. This paper's main contribution is an algorithm that achieves zero regret under accurate predictions. Additionally, a bounded regret bound of O(T^(3/4) * Vt^(1/4)) is established under certain normality conditions.

  Optimal transport between graphs, based on Gromov-Wasserstein and other extensions, is a powerful tool for comparing and aligning graph structures. However, solving the associated non-convex optimization problems is computationally expensive, which limits the scalability of these methods to large graphs. In this work, we present Unbalanced Learning of Optimal Transport (ULOT), a deep learning method that predicts optimal transport plans between two graphs. Our method is trained by minimizing the fused unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) loss. We propose a novel neural architecture with cross-attention that is conditioned on the FUGW tradeoff hyperparameters. We evaluate ULOT on synthetic stochastic block model (SBM) graphs and on real cortical surface data obtained from fMRI. ULOT predicts transport plans with competitive loss up to two orders of magnitude faster than classical solvers. Furthermore, the predicted plan can be used as a warm start for classical solvers to accelerate their convergence. Finally, the predicted transport plan is fully differentiable with respect to the graph inputs and FUGW hyperparameters, enabling the optimization of functionals of the ULOT plan.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Currently, existing tensor recovery methods fail to recognize the impact of tensor scale variations on their structural characteristics. Furthermore, existing studies face prohibitive computational costs when dealing with large-scale high-order tensor data. To alleviate these issue, assisted by the Krylov subspace iteration, block Lanczos bidiagonalization process, and random projection strategies, this article first devises two fast and accurate randomized algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) problem. Theoretical bounds on the accuracy of the approximation error estimate are established. Next, we develop a novel generalized nonconvex modeling framework tailored to large-scale tensor recovery, in which a new regularization paradigm is exploited to achieve insightful prior representation for large-scale tensors. On the basis of the above, we further investigate new unified nonconvex models and efficient optimization algorithms, respectively, for several typical high-order tensor recovery tasks in unquantized and quantized situations. To render the proposed algorithms practical and efficient for large-scale tensor data, the proposed randomized LRTA schemes are integrated into their central and time-intensive computations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various large-scale tensors, whose results demonstrate the practicability, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.

  Training large language models with reinforcement learning (RL) against verifiable rewards significantly enhances their reasoning abilities, yet remains computationally expensive due to inefficient uniform prompt sampling. We introduce Selective Prompting with Efficient Estimation of Difficulty (SPEED), an adaptive online RL curriculum that selectively chooses training examples of intermediate difficulty to maximize learning efficiency. Theoretically, we establish that intermediate-difficulty prompts improve the gradient estimator's signal-to-noise ratio, accelerating convergence. Empirically, our efficient implementation leads to 2x to 6x faster training without degrading accuracy, requires no manual tuning, and integrates seamlessly into standard RL algorithms.

  The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate and timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning. However, most forecasting models struggled, particularly during variant surges, when they were most needed. This study introduces a novel parallel-stream Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework to forecast daily state-level incident hospitalizations in the United States. Our framework incorporates a spatiotemporal feature, Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Meta's Social Connectedness Index, to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time. Our architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal dependencies, and a multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances forecasting consistency and error. An evaluation against the COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals the superiority of our model. On average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69 hospitalizations per state at the 7-, 14-, 21-, and 28-day horizons, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features, such as SPH, in modeling the complex dynamics of infectious disease spread.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained neural networks are commonly used and reused in the machine learning community. Alice trains a model for a particular task, and a part of her neural network is reused by Bob for a different task, often to great effect. To what can we ascribe Bob's success? This paper introduces an experimental setup through which factors contributing to Bob's empirical success could be studied in silico. As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer. When there is little correlation between tasks, only reusing lower pre-trained layers is preferable, and we hypothesize the converse: that the optimal number of retrained layers is indicative of task and feature correlation. Finally, we show in controlled real-world scenarios that Bob can effectively reuse Alice's pre-trained network if there are semantic correlations between his and Alice's task.

  Language models (LMs) and their extension, vision-language models (VLMs), have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, they still struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require multimodal or multilingual real-world knowledge. To support such capabilities, an external memory system that can efficiently provide relevant multimodal information is essential. Existing approaches generally concatenate image and text tokens into a long sequence as memory, which, however, may drastically increase context length and even degrade performance. In contrast, we propose using continuous memory, a compact set of dense embeddings to more effectively and efficiently represent multimodal and multilingual knowledge. Our key insight is that a VLM can serve as its own continuous memory encoder. We empirically show that this design improves performance on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. Building on this, we introduce a data-efficient and parameter-efficient method to fine-tune the VLM into a memory encoder, requiring only 1.2% of the model's parameters and a small corpus of 15.6K self-synthesized samples. Our approach CoMEM utilizes VLM's original capabilities to encode arbitrary multimodal and multilingual knowledge into just 8 continuous embeddings. Since the inference-time VLM remains frozen, our memory module is plug-and-play and can be flexibly integrated as needed. Extensive experiments across eight multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.

  The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

To address this challenge, we propose NoWag: (Normalized Weight and Activation Guided Compression), a unified framework for zero-shot shape preserving compression algorithms. We compressed Llama-2 7B/13B/70B and Llama-3 8/70BB models, using two popular forms of shape-preserving compression, vector quantization NoWag-VQ (NoWag for Vector Quantization), and unstructured/semi-structured pruning NoWag-P (NoWag for Pruning). We found that NoWag-VQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero shot VQ, and that NoWag-P performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods.

  Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it on unpaired successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. A key challenge we identify is that naive fine-tuning can degrade the model's search capability; we show this can be mitigated with a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown reasoning benchmarks show that, replacing CoT-generated data with search-generated data for offline fine-tuning improves success rates by around 23% over inference-time search baselines, while reducing inference time by 180$\times$. On top of this, our learning and forgetting objective consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and preference-based methods.

  Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has driven many recent breakthroughs in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet, persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC (TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.

  Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecastingthis http URLresults show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) possess encompassing capabilities that can process diverse language-related tasks. However, finetuning on LLMs will diminish this general skills and continual finetuning will further cause severe degradation on accumulated knowledge. Recently, Continual Learning (CL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises which aims to continually adapt the LLMs to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge and inheriting general skills. Existing techniques either leverage previous data to replay, leading to extra computational costs, or utilize a single parameter-efficient module to learn the downstream task, constraining new knowledge absorption with interference between different tasks. Toward these issues, this paper proposes Analytic Subspace Routing(ASR) to address these challenges. For each task, we isolate the learning within a subspace of deep layers' features via low-rank adaptation, eliminating knowledge interference between different tasks. Additionally, we propose an analytic routing mechanism to properly utilize knowledge learned in different subspaces. Our approach employs Recursive Least Squares to train a multi-task router model, allowing the router to dynamically adapt to incoming data without requiring access to historical data. Also, the router effectively assigns the current task to an appropriate subspace and has a non-forgetting property of previously learned tasks with a solid theoretical guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect retention of prior knowledge while seamlessly integrating new information, effectively overcoming the core limitations of existing methods. Our code will be released after acceptance.

  Longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHRs) represent an individual`s clinical history through a sequence of codified concepts, including diagnoses, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) can leverage this data to predict future events. While fine-tuning of these models can enhance task-specific performance, it becomes costly when applied to many clinical prediction tasks. In contrast, a pretrained foundation model can be used in zero-shot forecasting setting, offering a scalable alternative to fine-tuning separate models for each outcome.This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of zero-shot forecasting with GPT-based foundational models in EHRs, introducing a novel pipeline that formulates medical concept prediction as a generative modeling task. Unlike supervised approaches requiring extensive labeled data, our method enables the model to forecast a next medical event purely from a pretraining knowledge. We evaluate performance across multiple time horizons and clinical categories, demonstrating model`s ability to capture latent temporal dependencies and complex patient trajectories without task supervision.Model performance for predicting the next medical concept was evaluated using precision and recall metrics, achieving an average top1 precision of 0.614 and recall of 0.524. For 12 major diagnostic conditions, the model demonstrated strong zero-shot performance, achieving high true positive rates while maintaining low false positives.We demonstrate the power of a foundational EHR GPT model in capturing diverse phenotypes and enabling robust, zero-shot forecasting of clinical outcomes. This capability enhances the versatility of predictive healthcare models and reduces the need for task-specific training, enabling more scalable applications in clinical settings.

  Self-play alignment has emerged as an effective approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), formulating preference optimization as a two-player game. However, the regularization with respect to the reference policy, which is crucial for mitigating over-optimization, has been insufficiently investigated in self-play alignment. To study the impact of different regularization strategies, we propose \textbf{Regularized Self-Play Policy Optimization (RSPO)}, a general and modular framework that unifies prior methods and enables simple plug-and-play integration of various regularizers, meanwhile preserving convergence to Nash equilibrium of the corresponding regularizedthis http URLempirical study involving over $120$ fine-tuned Mistral-7B-Instruct models reveals that forward KL divergence regularization reduces response length, whereas reverse KL divergence markedly improves raw win rates. Crucially, RSPO regularized with a linear combination of forward and reverse KL divergence significantly boosts the length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval-2 from $28.5\%$ (unregularized self-play, SPPO) to $35.4\%$, and consistently demonstrates superior performance on Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, ArmoRM scores, and response diversity. Combining simplicity, convergence guarantees, and significant empirical gains, RSPO offers a strong foundation for exploring regularized self-play in language model alignment.

  Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with millons of deaths each year, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health agencies. While significant progress has been made in the field of heart failure, leading to improved survival rates and improvement of ejection fraction, there remains substantial unmet needs, due to the complexity and multifactorial characteristics. Therefore, we propose a composable strategy framework for assessment and treatment optimization in heart failure. This framework simulates the doctor-patient consultation process and leverages multi-modal algorithms to analyze a range of data, including video, physical examination, text results as well as medical history. By integrating these various data sources, our framework offers a more holistic evaluation and optimized treatment plan for patients. Our results demonstrate that this multi-modal approach outperforms single-modal artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in terms of accuracy in heart failure (HF) prognosis prediction. Through this method, we can further evaluate the impact of various pathological indicators on HF prognosis,providing a more comprehensive evaluation.

  The success of large generative models has driven a paradigm shift, leveraging massive multi-source data to enhance model capabilities. However, the interaction among these sources remains theoretically underexplored. This paper takes the first step toward a rigorous analysis of multi-source training in conditional generative modeling, where each condition represents a distinct data source. Specifically, we establish a general distribution estimation error bound in average total variation distance for conditional maximum likelihood estimation based on the bracketing number. Our result shows that when source distributions share certain similarities and the model is expressive enough, multi-source training guarantees a sharper bound than single-source training. We further instantiate the general theory on conditional Gaussian estimation and deep generative models including autoregressive and flexible energy-based models, by characterizing their bracketing numbers. The results highlight that the number of sources and similarity among source distributions improve the advantage of multi-source training. Simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the theory, with code available at:this https URL.

  We introduce DeepCell, a novel circuit representation learning framework that effectively integrates multiview information from both And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) and Post-Mapping (PM) netlists. At its core, DeepCell employs a self-supervised Mask Circuit Modeling (MCM) strategy, inspired by masked language modeling, to fuse complementary circuit representations from different design stages into unified and rich embeddings. To our knowledge, DeepCell is the first framework explicitly designed for PM netlist representation learning, setting new benchmarks in both predictive accuracy and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate the practical efficacy of DeepCell by applying it to critical EDA tasks such as functional Engineering Change Orders (ECO) and technology mapping. Extensive experimental results show that DeepCell significantly surpasses state-of-the-art open-source EDA tools in efficiency and performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effectively utilizing extensive unlabeled high-density EEG data to improve performance in scenarios with limited labeled low-density EEG data presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by formulating it as a graph transfer learning and knowledge distillation problem. We propose a Unified Pre-trained Graph Contrastive Masked Autoencoder Distiller, named EEG-DisGCMAE, to bridge the gap between unlabeled and labeled as well as high- and low-density EEG data. Our approach introduces a novel unified graph self-supervised pre-training paradigm, which seamlessly integrates the graph contrastive pre-training with the graph masked autoencoder pre-training. Furthermore, we propose a graph topology distillation loss function, allowing a lightweight student model trained on low-density data to learn from a teacher model trained on high-density data during pre-training and fine-tuning. This method effectively handles missing electrodes through contrastive distillation. We validate the effectiveness of EEG-DisGCMAE across four classification tasks using two clinical EEG datasets with abundant data. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  By using a control variate to calibrate the local gradient of each client, Scaffold has been widely known as a powerful solution to mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity in Federated Learning. Although Scaffold achieves significant performance improvements, we show that this superiority is at the cost of increased security vulnerabilities. Specifically, this paper presents BadSFL, the first backdoor attack targeting Scaffold, which turns benign clients into accomplices to amplify the attack effect. The core idea of BadSFL is to uniquely tamper with the control variate to subtly steer benign clients' local gradient updates towards the attacker's poisoned direction, effectively turning them into unwitting accomplices and significantly enhancing the backdoor persistence. Additionally, BadSFL leverages a GAN-enhanced poisoning strategy to enrich the attacker's dataset, maintaining high accuracy on both benign and backdoored samples while remaining stealthy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BadSFL achieves superior attack durability, maintaining effectiveness for over 60 global rounds, lasting up to three times longer than existing baselines even after ceasing malicious model injections.

  Predicting a sequence of actions has been crucial in the success of recent behavior cloning algorithms in robotics. Can similar ideas improve reinforcement learning (RL)? We answer affirmatively by observing that incorporating action sequences when predicting ground-truth return-to-go leads to lower validation loss. Motivated by this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e., explicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing action sequences. Our experiments show that CQN-AS outperforms several baselines on a variety of sparse-reward humanoid control and tabletop manipulation tasks from BiGym and RLBench.

  Effectively modeling multimodal longitudinal data is a pressing need in various application areas, especially biomedicine. Despite this, few approaches exist in the literature for this problem, with most not adequately taking into account the multimodality of the data. In this study, we developed multiple configurations of a novel multimodal and longitudinal learning framework, Longitudinal Ensemble Integration (LEI), for sequential classification. We evaluated LEI's performance, and compared it against existing approaches, for the early detection of dementia, which is among the most studied multimodal sequential classification tasks. LEI outperformed these approaches due to its use of intermediate base predictions arising from the individual data modalities, which enabled their better integration over time. LEI's design also enabled the identification of features that were consistently important across time for the effective prediction of dementia-related diagnoses. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of LEI for sequential classification from longitudinal multimodal data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) underpins real-time monitoring in cloud services and web systems, allowing rapid identification of anomalies to prevent costly failures. Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling "normal" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Causal machine learning holds promise for estimating individual treatment effects from complex data. For successful real-world applications of machine learning methods, it is of paramount importance to obtain reliable insights into which variables drive heterogeneity in the response to treatment. We propose PermuCATE, an algorithm based on the Conditional Permutation Importance (CPI) method, for statistically rigorous global variable importance assessment in the estimation of the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). Theoretical analysis of the finite sample regime and empirical studies show that PermuCATE has lower variance than the Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) reference method and provides a reliable measure of variable importance. This property increases statistical power, which is crucial for causal inference in the limited-data regime common to biomedical applications. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of PermuCATE in simulated and real-world health datasets, including settings with up to hundreds of correlated variables.

  Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are widely used to model dynamic systems where relationships and features evolve over time. Although TGNNs demonstrate strong predictive capabilities in these domains, their complex architectures pose significant challenges for explainability. Counterfactual explanation methods provide a promising solution by illustrating how modifications to input graphs can influence model predictions. To address this challenge, we present CoDy, Counterfactual Explainer for Dynamic Graphs, a model-agnostic, instance-level explanation approach that identifies counterfactual subgraphs to interpret TGNN predictions. CoDy employs a search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with heuristic selection policies, efficiently exploring a vast search space of potential explanatory subgraphs by leveraging spatial, temporal, and local event impact information. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art factual and counterfactual baselines demonstrate CoDy's effectiveness, with improvements of 16% in AUFSC+ over the strongest baseline.

  _Wee Chaimanowong, Ying Zhu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many machine learning models leverage group invariance which is enjoyed with a wide-range of applications. For exploiting an invariance structure, one common approach is known as \emph{frame averaging}. One popular example of frame averaging is the \emph{group averaging}, where the entire group is used to symmetrize a function. The other end of the spectrum is the \emph{canonicalization}, where a frame at each point consists of a single group element which transforms the point to its orbit representative. Compared to group averaging, canonicalization is more efficient computationally. However, it results in non-differentiablity or discontinuity of the canonicalized function. As a result, the theoretical performance of canonicalization has not been given much attention. In this work, we establish an approximation theory for canonicalization. Specifically, we bound the point-wise and $L^2(\mathbb{P})$ approximation errors as well as the kernel's eigenvalue decay rates associated with a canonicalization trick.

  Continual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Co-MARL) requires agents to address catastrophic forgetting issues while learning new coordination policies with the dynamics team. In this paper, we delve into the core of Co-MARL, namely Relation Patterns, which refer to agents' general understanding of interactions. In addition to generality, relation patterns exhibit task-specificity when mapped to different action spaces. To this end, we propose a novel method called General Relation Patterns-Guided Task-Specific Decision-Maker (RPG). In RPG, agents extract relation patterns from dynamic observation spaces using a relation capturer. These task-agnostic relation patterns are then mapped to different action spaces via a task-specific decision-maker generated by a conditional hypernetwork. To combat forgetting, we further introduce regularization items on both the relation capturer and the conditional hypernetwork. Results on SMAC and LBF demonstrate that RPG effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction. Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62% improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art object-centric flow methods.

  Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do), embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2) multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity, arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation datasets effectively.

  Perching on structures such as trees, beams, and ledges is essential for extending the endurance of aerial robots by enabling energy conservation in standby or observation modes. A tethered tensile perching mechanism offers a simple, adaptable solution that can be retrofitted to existing robots and accommodates a variety of structure sizes and shapes. However, tethered tensile perching introduces significant modelling challenges which require precise management of aerial robot dynamics, including the cases of tether slack & tension, and momentum transfer. Achieving smooth wrapping and secure anchoring by targeting a specific tether segment adds further complexity. In this work, we present a novel trajectory framework for tethered tensile perching, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) through the Soft Actor-Critic from Demonstrations (SACfD) algorithm. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations, our approach enhances training efficiency and responsiveness, achieving precise control over position and velocity. This framework enables the aerial robot to accurately target specific tether segments, facilitating reliable wrapping and secure anchoring. We validate our framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, and demonstrate effectiveness in achieving agile and reliable trajectory generation for tensile perching.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In disaster response or surveillance operations, quickly identifying areas needing urgent attention is critical, but deploying response teams to every location is inefficient or often impossible. Effective performance in this domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by 16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world platforms using quad-copters.

  Scrubbing surfaces is a physically demanding and time-intensive task. Removing adhered contamination requires substantial friction generated through pressure and torque or high lateral forces. Rigid robotic manipulators, while capable of exerting these forces, are usually confined to structured environments isolated from humans due to safety risks. In contrast, soft robot arms can safely work around humans and adapt to environmental uncertainty, but typically struggle to transmit the continuous torques or lateral forces necessary for scrubbing. Here, we demonstrate a soft robotic arm scrubbing adhered residues using torque and pressure, a task traditionally challenging for soft robots. We train a neural network to learn the arm's inverse kinematics and elasticity, which enables open-loop force and position control. Using this learned model, the robot successfully scrubbed burnt food residue from a plate and sticky fruit preserve from a toilet seat, removing an average of 99.7% of contamination. This work demonstrates how soft robots, capable of exerting continuous torque, can effectively and safely scrub challenging contamination from surfaces.

  Demanding task environments (e.g., supervising a remotely piloted aircraft) require performing tasks quickly and accurately; however, periods of low and high operator workload can decrease task performance. Intelligent modulation of the system's demands and interaction modality in response to changes in operator workload state may increase performance by avoiding undesirable workload states. This system requires real-time estimation of each workload component (i.e., cognitive, physical, visual, speech, and auditory) to adapt the correct modality. Existing workload systems estimate multiple workload components post-hoc, but few estimate speech workload, or function in real-time. An algorithm to estimate speech workload and mitigate undesirable workload states in real-time is presented. An analysis of the algorithm's accuracy is presented, along with the results demonstrating the algorithm's generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms. Real-time speech workload estimation is a crucial element towards developing adaptive human-machine systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Purpose: Central venous catheterization (CVC) is a critical medical procedure for vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, and life-saving interventions. Its success remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided visualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further complicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle placement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems offer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In this work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline, from scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a deep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a depth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously define the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework is proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and arteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone. Finally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance with operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity commercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The proposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the first attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15 \textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less than or close to 1 \textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first robotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated planning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for clinical translation.

  Recent advancements in robotic grasping have led to its integration as a core module in many manipulation systems. For instance, language-driven semantic segmentation enables the grasping of any designated object or object part. However, existing methods often struggle to generate feasible grasp poses for small objects or delicate components, potentially causing the entire pipeline to fail. To address this issue, we propose a novel grasping method, FineGrasp, which introduces improvements in three key aspects. First, we introduce multiple network modifications to enhance the ability of to handle delicate regions. Second, we address the issue of label imbalance and propose a refined graspness label normalization strategy. Third, we introduce a new simulated grasp dataset and show that mixed sim-to-real training further improves grasp performance. Experimental results show significant improvements, especially in grasping small objects, and confirm the effectiveness of our system in semantic grasping.

  Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra, RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset, which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost, computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on dynamic path planning under complex environmental constraints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy, but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated. Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between communication cost and model performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic contexts and discern intentions of other participants, consequently generating decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD, a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM) augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the CARLA Simulator demonstrates LeAD's superior handling of unconventional scenarios, achieving 71 points on Leaderboard V1 benchmark, with a route completion of 93%.

  Inertia drift is a transitional maneuver between two sustained drift stages in opposite directions, which provides valuable insights for navigating consecutive sharp corners for autonomousthis http URL, this can be a challenging scenario for the drift controller to handle rapid transitions between opposing sideslip angles while maintaining accurate path tracking. Moreover, accurate drift control depends on a high-fidelity vehicle model to derive drift equilibrium points and predict vehicle states, but this is often compromised by the strongly coupled longitudinal-lateral drift dynamics and unpredictable environmental variations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a learning-based planning and control framework utilizing Bayesian optimization (BO), which develops a planning logic to ensure a smooth transition and minimal velocity loss between inertia and sustained drift phases. BO is further employed to learn a performance-driven control policy that mitigates modeling errors for enhanced system performance. Simulation results on an 8-shape reference path demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve smooth and stable inertia drift through sharp corners.

  High fidelity estimation algorithms for robotics require accurate data. However, timestamping of sensor data is a key issue that rarely receives the attention it deserves. Inaccurate timestamping can be compensated for in post-processing but is imperative for online estimation. Simultaneously, even online mitigation of timing issues can be achieved through a relaxation of the tuning parameters from their otherwise more performative optimal values, but at a detriment to performance. To address the need for real-time, low-cost timestamping, a versatile system which utilizes readily-available components and established methods for synchronization is introduced. The synchronization and triggering (of both high- and low-rate sensors) capabilities of the system are demonstrated.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety is a critical concern in motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Modern autonomous vehicles rely on neural network-based perception, but making control decisions based on these inference results poses significant safety risks due to inherent uncertainties. To address this challenge, we present a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that accounts for both aleatoric and epistemic perception uncertainties using evidential deep learning (EDL). Our approach introduces a novel ambiguity set formulation based on evidential distributions that dynamically adjusts the conservativeness according to perception confidence levels. We integrate this uncertainty-aware constraint into model predictive control (MPC), proposing the DRO-EDL-MPC algorithm with computational tractability for autonomous driving applications. Validation in the CARLA simulator demonstrates that our approach maintains efficiency under high perception confidence while enforcing conservative constraints under low confidence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones, conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.

  Recent research has highlighted the powerful capabilities of imitation learning in robotics. Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency. While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions. Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then, it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained robotic platforms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote Center of Motion (RCM) robotic manipulators have revolutionized Minimally Invasive Surgery, enabling precise, dexterous surgical manipulation within the patient's body cavity without disturbing the insertion point on the patient. Accurate RCM tool control is vital for incorporating autonomous subtasks like suturing, blood suction, and tumor resection into robotic surgical procedures, reducing surgeon fatigue and improving patient outcomes. However, these cable-driven systems are subject to significant joint reading errors, corrupting the kinematics computation necessary to perform control. Although visual tracking with endoscopic cameras can correct errors on in-view joints, errors in the kinematic chain prior to the insertion point are irreparable because they remain out of view. No prior work has characterized the stability of control under these conditions. We fill this gap by designing a provably stable tracking-in-the-loop controller for the out-of-view portion of the RCM manipulator kinematic chain. We additionally incorporate this controller into a bilevel control scheme for the full kinematic chain. We rigorously benchmark our method in simulated and real world settings to verify our theoretical findings. Our work provides key insights into the next steps required for the transition from teleoperated to autonomous surgery.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose 3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation. Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads, boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

  This paper discusses Chrono's Continuous Representation Model (called herein Chrono::CRM), a general-purpose, scalable, and efficient simulation solution for terramechanics problems. Built on Chrono's Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework, Chrono::CRM moves beyond semi-empirical terramechanics approaches, e.g., Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto, to provide a physics-based model able to address complex tasks such as digging, grading, as well as interaction with deformable wheels and complex grouser/lug patterns. The terramechanics model is versatile in that it allows the terrain to interact with both rigid and flexible implements simulated via the Chrono dynamics engine. We validate Chrono::CRM against experimental data from three physical tests, including one involving NASA's MGRU3 rover. In addition, the simulator is benchmarked against a high-fidelity Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of a digging scenario involving the Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR). Being GPU-accelerated, Chrono::CRM achieves computational efficiency comparable to that of semi-empirical simulation approaches for terramechanics problems. Through an ``active domains'' implementation, Chrono::CRM can handle terrain stretches up to 10 km long with 100 million SPH particles at near interactive rates, making high-fidelity off-road simulations at large scales feasible. As a component of the Chrono package, the CRM model is open source and released under a BSD-3 license. All models and simulations used in this contribution are available in a public GitHub repository for reproducibility studies and further research.

  Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios. In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction, instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval with high success rates.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents Auto-RubikAI, a modular autonomous planning framework that integrates a symbolic Knowledge Base (KB), a vision-language model (VLM), and a large language model (LLM) to solve structured manipulation tasks exemplified by Rubik's Cube restoration. Unlike traditional robot systems based on predefined scripts, or modern approaches relying on pretrained networks and large-scale demonstration data, Auto-RubikAI enables interpretable, multi-step task execution with minimal data requirements and no prior demonstrations. The proposed system employs a KB module to solve group-theoretic restoration steps, overcoming LLMs' limitations in symbolic reasoning. A VLM parses RGB-D input to construct a semantic 3D scene representation, while the LLM generates structured robotic control code via prompt chaining. This tri-module architecture enables robust performance under spatial uncertainty. We deploy Auto-RubikAI in both simulation and real-world settings using a 7-DOF robotic arm, demonstrating effective Sim-to-Real adaptation without retraining. Experiments show a 79% end-to-end task success rate across randomized configurations. Compared to CFOP, DeepCubeA, and Two-Phase baselines, our KB-enhanced method reduces average solution steps while maintaining interpretability and safety. Auto-RubikAI provides a cost-efficient, modular foundation for embodied task planning in smart manufacturing, robotics education, and autonomous execution scenarios. Code, prompts, and hardware modules will be released upon publication.

  We introduce PAPRLE (Plug-And-Play Robotic Limb Environment), a modular ecosystem that enables flexible placement and control of robotic limbs. With PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader adoption and community-driven extension.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robots struggle to understand object properties like shape, material, and semantics due to limited prior knowledge, hindering manipulation in unstructured environments. In contrast, humans learn these properties through interactive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and tactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF) representation for active perception of object properties. While primarily focusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling surface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using point cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates, which are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By utilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need extensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by aggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework iteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using differentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions. By quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to maximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the real-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot manipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile sensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In these experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects assumed to be static and placed on the table. To improve scalability, we investigate approximation methods like inducing point method for Gaussian Processes. This probabilistic multi-modal fusion enables active exploration and mapping of complex object geometries, extending potentially beyond geometry.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For effective real-world deployment, robots should adapt to human preferences, such as balancing distance, time, and safety in delivery routing. Active preference learning (APL) learns human reward functions by presenting trajectories for ranking. However, existing methods often struggle to explore the full trajectory space and fail to identify informative queries, particularly in long-horizon tasks. We propose CRED, a trajectory generation method for APL that improves reward estimation by jointly optimizing environment design and trajectory selection. CRED "imagines" new scenarios through environment design and uses counterfactual reasoning -- by sampling rewards from its current belief and asking "What if this reward were the true preference?" -- to generate a diverse and informative set of trajectories for ranking. Experiments in GridWorld and real-world navigation using OpenStreetMap data show that CRED improves reward learning and generalizes effectively across different environments.

  In this paper, we address stereo acoustic data fusion for marine robotics and propose a geometry-based method for projecting observed features from one sonar to another for a cross-modal stereo sonar setup that consists of both a forward-looking and a sidescan sonar. Our acoustic geometry for sidescan and forward-looking sonar is inspired by the epipolar geometry for stereo cameras, and we leverage relative pose information to project where an observed feature in one sonar image will be found in the image of another sonar. Additionally, we analyze how both the feature location relative to the sonar and the relative pose between the two sonars impact the projection. From simulated results, we identify desirable stereo configurations for applications in field robotics like feature correspondence and recovery of the 3D information of the feature.

  Robot manipulation has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with imitation learning policies enabling successful performance of dexterous and hard-to-model tasks. Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the development of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating large-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While these models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful evaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the pace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current capabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot manipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by extending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and real-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to rigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical confidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized trials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world experiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more successful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly, using a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover, performance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows. Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The nonlinear dynamics of many under-actuated wheeled platforms are governed by nonholonomic constraints of no-skid for passively rolling wheels, coupled with momentum balance. In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e. joint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering angle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model where the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor attached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to rotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes multiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as stability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as well as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We use perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under symmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further scaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the symmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and structural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with numerical simulations. The results highlight the role of passive shape variables in generating multi-stable periodic solutions for nonholonomic systems of robotic locomotion.

  Recent advancements in imitation learning have shown promising results in robotic manipulation, driven by the availability of high-quality training data. To improve data collection efficiency, some approaches focus on developing specialized teleoperation devices for robot control, while others directly use human hand demonstrations to obtain training data. However, the former requires both a robotic system and a skilled operator, limiting scalability, while the latter faces challenges in aligning the visual gap between human hand demonstrations and the deployed robot observations. To address this, we propose a human hand data collection system combined with our hand-to-gripper generative model, which translates human hand demonstrations into robot gripper demonstrations, effectively bridging the observation gap. Specifically, a GoPro fisheye camera is mounted on the human wrist to capture human hand demonstrations. We then train a generative model on a self-collected dataset of paired human hand and UMI gripper demonstrations, which have been processed using a tailored data pre-processing strategy to ensure alignment in both timestamps and observations. Therefore, given only human hand demonstrations, we are able to automatically extract the corresponding SE(3) actions and integrate them with high-quality generated robot demonstrations through our generation pipeline for training robotic policy model. In experiments, the robust manipulation performance demonstrates not only the quality of the generated robot demonstrations but also the efficiency and practicality of our data collection method.

The proposed system comprises three layers: (1) a low-level RL-based controller responsible for tracking whole-body motion targets; (2) a mid-level set of skill policies trained via imitation learning that produce motion targets for different steps of a task; and (3) a high-level vision-language planning module that determines which skills should be executed and also monitors their completion in real-time using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Experimental validation is performed on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot executing a non-prehensile pick-and-place task. Over 40 real-world trials, the hierarchical system achieved a 73% success rate in completing the full manipulation sequence. These experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed hierarchical system, highlighting the benefits of VLM-based skill planning and monitoring for multi-step manipulation scenarios.

  Humans practice slow thinking before performing actual actions when handling complex tasks in the physical world. This thinking paradigm, recently, has achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Research on autonomous surgery has largely focused on simple task automation in controlled environments. However, real-world surgical applications demand dexterous manipulation over extended durations and generalization to the inherent variability of human tissue. These challenges remain difficult to address using existing logic-based or conventional end-to-end learning approaches. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical framework for performing dexterous, long-horizon surgical steps. Our approach utilizes a high-level policy for task planning and a low-level policy for generating robot trajectories. The high-level planner plans in language space, generating task-level or corrective instructions that guide the robot through the long-horizon steps and correct for the low-level policy's errors. We validate our framework through ex vivo experiments on cholecystectomy, a commonly-practiced minimally invasive procedure, and conduct ablation studies to evaluate key components of the system. Our method achieves a 100\% success rate across eight unseen ex vivo gallbladders, operating fully autonomously without human intervention. This work demonstrates step-level autonomy in a surgical procedure, marking a milestone toward clinical deployment of autonomous surgical systems.

  How can we teach humanoids to climb staircases and sit on chairs using the surrounding environment context? Arguably, the simplest way is to just show them-casually capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We introduce VIDEOMIMIC, a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday videos, jointly reconstructs the humans and the environment, and produces whole-body control policies for humanoid robots that perform the corresponding skills. We demonstrate the results of our pipeline on real humanoid robots, showing robust, repeatable contextual control such as staircase ascents and descents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches, as well as other dynamic whole-body skills-all from a single policy, conditioned on the environment and global root commands. VIDEOMIMIC offers a scalable path towards teaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world environments.

  Robot sports, characterized by well-defined objectives, explicit rules, and dynamic interactions, present ideal scenarios for demonstrating embodied intelligence. In this paper, we present VolleyBots, a novel robot sports testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots integrates three features within a unified platform: competitive and cooperative gameplay, turn-based interaction structure, and agile 3D maneuvering. Competitive and cooperative gameplay challenges each drone to coordinate with its teammates while anticipating and countering opposing teams' tactics. Turn-based interaction demands precise timing, accurate state prediction, and management of long-horizon temporal dependencies. Agile 3D maneuvering requires rapid accelerations, sharp turns, and precise 3D positioning despite the quadrotor's underactuated dynamics. These intertwined features yield a complex problem combining motion control and strategic play, with no available expert demonstrations. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game-theoretic algorithms. Simulation results show that on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods outperform off-policy methods in single-agent tasks, but both approaches struggle in complex tasks that combine motion control and strategic play. We additionally design a hierarchical policy which achieves a 69.5% percent win rate against the strongest baseline in the 3 vs 3 task, underscoring its potential as an effective solution for tackling the complex interplay between low-level control and high-level strategy.

  An active approach to fault tolerance, the combined processes of fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery, is essential for long term autonomy in robots -- particularly multi-robot systems and swarms. Previous efforts have primarily focussed on spontaneously occurring electro-mechanical failures in the sensors and actuators of a minority sub-population of robots. While the systems that enable this function are valuable, they have not yet considered that many failures arise from gradual wear and tear with continued operation, and that this may be more challenging to detect than sudden step changes in performance. This paper presents the Artificial Antibody Population Dynamics (AAPD) model -- an immune-inspired model for the detection and diagnosis of gradual degradation in robot swarms. The AAPD model is demonstrated to reliably detect and diagnose gradual degradation, as well as spontaneous changes in performance, among swarms of robots of varying sizes while remaining tolerant of normally behaving robots. The AAPD model is distributed, offers supervised and unsupervised configurations, and demonstrates promising scalable properties. Deploying the AAPD model on a swarm of foraging robots undergoing gradual degradation enables the swarm to operate on average at between 70% - 97% of its performance in perfect conditions and is able to prevent instances of robots failing in the field during experiments in most of the cases tested.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation has made significant advancements, with systems demonstrating high precision and repeatability. However, this remarkable precision often fails to translate into efficient manipulation of thin deformable objects. Current robotic systems lack imprecise dexterity, the ability to perform dexterous manipulation through robust and adaptive behaviors that do not rely on precise control. This paper explores the singulation and grasping of thin, deformable objects. Here, we propose a novel solution that incorporates passive compliance, touch, and proprioception into thin, deformable object manipulation. Our system employs a soft, underactuated hand that provides passive compliance, facilitating adaptive and gentle interactions to dexterously manipulate deformable objects without requiring precise control. The tactile and force/torque sensors equipped on the hand, along with a depth camera, gather sensory data required for manipulation via the proposed slip module. The manipulation policies are learned directly from raw sensory data via model-free reinforcement learning, bypassing explicit environmental and object modeling. We implement a hierarchical double-loop learning process to enhance learning efficiency by decoupling the action space. Our method was deployed on real-world robots and trained in a self-supervised manner. The resulting policy was tested on a variety of challenging tasks that were beyond the capabilities of prior studies, ranging from displaying suit fabric like a salesperson to turning pages of sheet music for violinists.

  Multi-UAV pursuit-evasion, where pursuers aim to capture evaders, poses a key challenge for UAV swarm intelligence. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated potential in modeling cooperative behaviors, but most RL-based approaches remain constrained to simplified simulations with limited dynamics or fixed scenarios. Previous attempts to deploy RL policy to real-world pursuit-evasion are largely restricted to two-dimensional scenarios, such as ground vehicles or UAVs at fixed altitudes. In this paper, we address multi-UAV pursuit-evasion by considering UAV dynamics and physical constraints. We introduce an evader prediction-enhanced network to tackle partial observability in cooperative strategy learning. Additionally, we propose an adaptive environment generator within MARL training, enabling higher exploration efficiency and better policy generalization across diverse scenarios. Simulations show our method significantly outperforms all baselines in challenging scenarios, generalizing to unseen scenarios with a 100% capture rate. Finally, we derive a feasible policy via a two-stage reward refinement and deploy the policy on real quadrotors in a zero-shot manner. To our knowledge, this is the first work to derive and deploy an RL-based policy using collective thrust and body rates control commands for multi-UAV pursuit-evasion in unknown environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hierarchical control for robotics has long been plagued by the need to have a well defined interface layer to communicate between high-level task planners and low-level policies. With the advent of LLMs, language has been emerging as a prospective interface layer. However, this has several limitations. Not all tasks can be decomposed into steps that are easily expressible in natural language (e.g. performing a dance routine). Further, it makes end-to-end finetuning on embodied data challenging due to domain shift and catastrophic forgetting. We introduce our method -- Learnable Latent Codes as Bridges (LCB) -- as an alternate architecture to overcome these limitations. \method~uses a learnable latent code to act as a bridge between LLMs and low-level policies. This enables LLMs to flexibly communicate goals in the task plan without being entirely constrained by language limitations. Additionally, it enables end-to-end finetuning without destroying the embedding space of word tokens learned during pre-training. Through experiments on Language Table and Calvin, two common language based benchmarks for embodied agents, we find that \method~outperforms baselines (including those w/ GPT-4V) that leverage pure language as the interface layer on tasks that require reasoning and multi-step behaviors.
